Delivering real change

The Local Elections of 2004 are taking place at an important time in Irish politics.

The peace process is in grave difficulty. The Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people in a referendum just a year before the last Local Elections, has yet to be implemented. Sinn Féin has not been distracted by pre-election efforts of our political opponents to falsely place all the responsibility for the current difficulties on our shoulders. Instead we have continued with the hard work of rebuilding the peace process, representing our electorate and presenting our political programme to the people throughout the 32 Counties.

With this Local Government manifesto we present another part of that programme. We base it upon the principle that local power is a democratic right. As a party committed to building an Ireland of Equals we want to see local democracy strengthened and brought closer to the people. The disempowerment of local government over the past five years has had the opposite effect.

In this manifesto we set out our proposals for the reform of local government and the strengthening of democracy at community level. This is the basis on which our new councillors on local authorities throughout the 26 Counties will work. Their task will be to maximise the benefits of local government for the people, within the limits of the present structures, while all the time striving to change those structures. Fundamental reform of local government will require action at central government level.

In 2004 we in Sinn Féin are contesting more local authority seats than ever before. Our outgoing councillors have a record of work second to none. When they are joined by our new councillors after June 11th, Sinn Féin will be in a position to bring a new dynamic to local government.

Our councillors will be part of an All-Ireland team of elected representatives who are building a new Ireland. We are working to ensure that the corruption, neglect and mismanagement of the past is replaced by energetic campaigners, fighting for quality public services including empowered local democracy, accessible healthcare, housing as a right, improved transport, affordable childcare and education as the guarantee of equal opportunities for all.

We ask you to read and endorse this manifesto and confidently request your support on 11 June.

Executive Summary

Transforming Local Government

Sinn Féin supports a strong system of local government which is accountable, democratic, properly financed and has the maximum amount of powers devolved to it. The Government on the other hand, wants weak local government and has done everything in its power to bring this about, including:
• stripping powers from local councils in relation to waste management, planning, roads and bin charges
• giving the Environment Minister the power to abolish local authorities if they don’t do his bidding
• extending the power of unelected and unaccountable City and County Managers
• creating an ever-growing number of bodies, boards, commissions and agencies, which have at best nominal representation from elected representatives or in most cases none at all
• removing elected representatives from Health Boards
• underfunding local government

All of this has come after decades of corruption, when elected representatives abused their power for personal gain. The result has been planning chaos. Houses have been built without local amenities, transport, health and other services, while developers, builders, elected councillors and local authority officials have been allowed to make huge profits. All of this must change.

Sinn Féin has broad ranging proposals to transform local government in Ireland. structures, powers and responsibilities and the reform of local government financing.

These include new Sinn Fein’s Proposals
(1) New local government Structures, powers and responsibilities
(2) Reform of local government financing

New Structures

Sinn Féin is building for Irish unity and independence and we believe that as part of any new political arrangements we must maximise local democracy. We are proposing three tiers for local government in Ireland - regional, county and city, and district councils. These should work hand in hand with a network of community and neighbourhood councils.

Regional Councils

Sinn Féin is proposing a system of 15 Regional Councils for the island. These would play a role in regard to spatial planning, environmental protection, economic development, transport and other public sector utilities.

Agencies like the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, INI etc, would be restructured and democratised making them a part of local government rather than an unaccountable arm of central government as occurs at present. The same principle could be applied to health boards, educational agencies, the National Roads Authority and other groups.

County and City Councils

The 28 county, 5 city and 8 borough councils should have their existing powers widened especially in terms of economic development and local service provision in terms of health, education, roads, water, sewage, transport and social services.

District and Community Councils

The role of the district and community councils is to root local decision making in the community. District councils can integrate the towns and villages of Ireland into their natural hinterlands. They would take account of the reality of urbanisation and ultimately there would be no area of Ireland not covered by a district council. The boundaries of the district councils must take account of the identification of voters with a particular area rather than a skewed head count.

Democracy and accountability

If we are to have properly functioning, modern local government structures it needs to be on the basis of democracy, accountability and the expansion of powers and responsibility.

Sinn Féin supports:
• The expansion of the powers and responsibilities of local authorities including: control over education, employment, environment, health, housing and social services as well as the ability to raise tax revenue.
• Directly elected, full-time Cathaoirligh of City and County Councils who would take over many of the responsibilities which are currently held by city and county managers.
• The power to appoint a deputy Cathaoirleach from among the sitting Councillors as a possibility for local authority members.
• The Cathaoirligh consulting with local authority members in advance of exercising many of the powers of their office.
• The removal of the Minister of Environment’s power to abolish local Councils
• Appointment procedures to agencies such as Health Boards, economic development agencies and educational authorities should come under the remit of local government instead of being the spoils of office of central government.
• The setting of strict targets with set deadlines to redress the under representation of women in local government.
• Our councillors working to ensure that councils fully implement the Barcelona Declaration which they have adopted. The Declaration commits local authorities to promote disability awareness and to ensure that people with disabilites have full and equal access to facilities and resources, and that their special needs are met.

Funding Local Government

The improved services which people need and demand at local level can only be delivered through a planned programme of reform and resourcing. Local government cannot be transformed and democratic powers cannot be devolved to councils without the necessary funding.

Local government reform must involve placing local authorities on a sound and independent financial footing. The coalition Government announced a major independent review of local government funding on the 14th February 2003 but we are still awaiting the publication of its findings. It is clearly not a priority. Local government remains chronically under-funded; it is currently accounts for approximately 10% of government spending, far lower than the EU average.

Sinn Féin proposes:
• Progressive increases in the proportion of Government spending on local government to reach a target of 20% by 2009 in tandem with devolution of powers and functions
• Phasing out the outmoded model of annual budgeting and move towards multi-annual budgeting based on long-term planning at both local government and central government level.
• Local authorities having far greater autonomy in determining and democratically controlling the direction of expenditure in their respective areas
• Local government funds to be augmented by a packaging levy, similar to the plastic bag levy, to be imposed on manufacturers in order to reduce the massive amount of unnecessary packaging produced and to help fund a zero waste strategy
• Local authority commercial rates to be applied to State buildings and funds raised to be ringfenced for social housing
• A comprehensive review of the taxation system, including funding of local government, to fully determine who is and who is not paying tax and to carry out a full cost benefit analysis of the battery of tax reliefs that have been set up by successive governments; this review to be time limited, to involve wide public consultation and participation, and to formulate proposals for a truly equitable tax system

Tackling the housing crisis

Government inaction

There are 48,000 families, which is an excess of 130,000 people, on housing waiting lists in this state. There are approximately 6000 people homeless. Traveller accommodation action plans are not being implemented. Rising house prices have made the option of owning a home completely out of reach for a large proportion of people on average incomes.In 2003 house prices increased by 13.4% and 16.3% for new and second-hand houses respectively.

The housing crisis has been caused as a result of the failure of the Government to tackle uncontrolled vested interests in the private house building sector and its refusal to provide funding to local authorities for the construction of social and affordable housing.

Housing is a right

Sinn Féin is campaigning for:
• The right to adequate and appropriate housing for all to be enshrined in the Constitution.

This would oblige statutory bodies to provide adequate and appropriate housing for all of the people of this state. It represents a first step which must be followed by legislation which will bring about the progressive realisation of this right.
• Finance for local authorities to construct adequate social and affordable housing
• Creation of a National Housing Strategy and a National Housing Agency to co-ordinate all aspects of housing provision.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for: Home ownership
• Funding for a major new Social Housing Programme by local authorities as the primary response to the housing crisis
• Increasing the threshold for participation in the shared ownership and affordable housing scheme in line with inflation
• An end to excessive development levies which penalise first time buyers and are being used merely to make up for the short fall in local government funding
• Community involvement in the planning of new housing

Local authority housing
• All housing developments to be integrated and have all necessary services and infrastructure including facilities for children and young people.
• Local authorities to fulfil their responsibility to deliver adequate and appropriate housing for the communities which they represent, including the setting and implementation of targets for the elimination of housing waiting lists
• Proper maintenance and security on all local authority housing to ensure tenant safety and a well-kept housing stock to meet future needs
• All councils to have social housing building programme which take cognisance of the differing needs of different groups including single people
• Local authorities to develop a State-wide Accommodation Strategy for People with Disabilities; all local authorities to have a dedicated Access Officer employed to inspect planning applications; the Disabled Persons Housing Grant to cover 100% of the actual cost of building work and standard qualification criteria to apply throughout the State
• Local authorities to work with voluntary and State agencies to develop and implement an appropriate accommodation strategy for people who experience mental illness
• Proper security and upkeep of local authority housing complexes for the elderly. Local authorities must also ensure the facilities and amenities are provided at these complexes to allow elderly people to have a better quality of life. Implementation of measures to enable elderly people to continue living in their own home where this is their preference including making all new accommodation lifetime adaptable
• No council house to remain boarded up for more than 2 months
• Maximum usage to be made of existing derelict sites legislation to target those sitting on such sites so that this land can be used for the construction of social and affordable housing
• The use of CPO at current use value to enable local authorities to secure land for housing

Homeless
• Local Authority Homeless Action Plans to be placed on a statutory basis and for all local authorities to implement homeless action plans
• Local authorities concentrating on medium and long-term solutions for homeless people and ring fencing a proportion of their housing stock. A vast amount of money is being wasted on bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless people. Of the €39million allocated in 2002 for accommodation and related homeless services, €22.5 million of this was allocated to emergency bed and breakfast accommodation. In addition to this, all local authorities must implement traveller accommodation plans within the agreed timeframe, that is by the end of 2004

Rent
• A graduated rents discount policy as a viable alternative to the 'right-to-buy' policy, which is creating a huge diminution in local authority housing stock
• Immediate reversal of the restrictions and cutbacks in Rent Allowance announced with the Estimates, until it is possible to house all those in need of social housing
• Removal of the unrealistic €107 cap on Rent Allowance
• Statutory control of rents in the private rented sector, strengthened laws to set standards for accommodation and more resources to implement those regulations. The introduction of measures to prevent discrimination against those trying to enter the private sector based on nationality and sexual orientation
• The abolition of ground rents

Health for all is a local issue

The need for fundamental reform

Sinn Féin is campaigning for fundamental reform of our health services to remove gross inequality, reverse the legacy of under-funding and make the services more efficient and responsive to the needs of the people.

Two tier system

Under the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government, our health services are more unequal than ever. Access to a hospital bed is determined by how much money you have and not by how ill you are. We have a two-tier public/private system, with the State subsidising the private healthcare business at the expense of public patients.

Broken promises

This Government promised in 2002 to permanently end hospital waiting lists by May 2004. It was a promise they knew they would not keep and today there are some 27,000 people on hospital waiting lists. They promised to issue a further 200,000 medical cards. They have broken that promise also.

Resource failures

Despite a series of detailed reports analysing the state of the health services and despite an increased level of current spending to above the EU average, our health services still suffer from the legacy of decades of under-funding and from the present-day reality of gross inequality. The twin failures of successive governments – the failure to reform and the failure to resource – continue in 2004 only in different guises.

Hanly

This Government has presided over the increasing centralisation of health services. Under the Hanly Report they are threatening to further downgrade local hospitals and remove services such as Accident & Emergency and Maternity units.

Action to reduce the working hours of junior hospital doctors is welcome, and indeed essential, but the associated proposals in Hanly to downgrade and slash services in hospitals throughout this State are wrong and should be resisted.

We are repeatedly told that services such as A&E and maternity should be centralised in regional and national centres of excellence. Yet the communities who are expected to bear the brunt of loss of services from their hospitals are witnessing crisis situations unfolding in existing centres of excellence such as the main Dublin hospitals.

The need for democratic accountability

The FF/PD Government is also abolishing the health boards which, for all their faults, at least allowed for some democratic accountability by including elected members of local authorities.

Bureaucratic change is being implemented at the expense of accountability. Elected representatives on health boards had a minor role but they could scrutinise the delivery of health services on behalf of ordinary citizens.

The proposed creation of a Health Services Executive is an exercise in political expediency. The Government wants to shift responsibility from the Minister for Health and Children and his Department to such an Executive, which would not be directly answerable to the Dáil for its decisions. Combined with the exclusion of elected representatives from the new structures, this is a blow to democracy.

Sinn Féin’s alternative

We are calling for:
• An end to the two-tier system.
• An Irish National Health Service with care free at the point of delivery for all.
• All-Ireland co-operation in health service delivery.
• The new all-Ireland health system to be funded from general taxation in a reformed tax system.

Sinn Féin councillors will:
• Support the retention and further development of the maximum range of services at local hospitals and the provision of quality hospital care for all, regardless of income or geographic location.
• Demand restoration of services to those hospitals where units such as A&E and maternity have been closed down.
• Press for the delivery of promised primary care services.
• Campaign for the rollout of radiotherapy and other cancer treatment services to all regions.
• Demand democratic accountability and a continuing role for elected representatives in ensuring that the health service needs of people are being met.

Environment

Promoting Environmental Rights

Everyone has the right to a safe, clean and unpolluted environment. The state has a responsibility through local government to ensure that this right is upheld. Sinn Féin is committed to regaining democratic control over waste management and have stringently opposed the measures introduced by the current Government which have removed these powers from local authorities. To this end Sinn Féin TD’s introduced a Waste Management (Amendment) Bill in the Dáil in 2003, which sought to return the powers to make waste management plans to the elected members of local authorities.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for:
• A waste management policy which prioritises reducing the production of waste and an effective and comprehensive system of recycling and reusing waste materials
• A policy of ‘producer pays’ in relation to the creation of waste to target those industries and manufacturers who are responsible for the creation of the majority of waste
• Local authorities to be given a role in pollution reduction and in bringing about reductions in emissions to enable this State to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol
• Properly applied behaviour modifying carbon taxes on industry to be provided both as an incentive for industry to reduce emissions output and as a source of revenue for local authorities
• Privatisation of waste management services to be opposed
• Incineration and all attempts to impose incineration on communities against their will to be opposed
• The power to make waste management plans to be returned to local authorities
• Adequate funding to be made available to ensure full separated waste collection from all homes within the state during the period of the current Waste Management Plans
• The abolition of local authority refuse charges
• Distribution of a composting bins to all house-holds within the State. Local authorities to establish communal composting facilities for urban householders who do not have their own gardens
• Progressive and targeted phasing out of the use of landfill
• Refund depots /machines to be provided in all shopping centres and supermarkets
• Adequate funding to be made available to achieve a target of 20% renewable energy by 2010 and 50% by 2020
• The nurturing of the renewable energy industry through public and local enterprise solutions such as target linked tax incentives, lower VAT on renewable energy products and ensure that access charges to the national grid are affordable or subsidised
• All government taxes and incentives to be assessed for possible impact on the environment
• Support for local water schemes and the development of rural sewerage schemes
• The closure of Sellafield. Sinn Féin will bring the fight to close Sellafield into every local authority chamber in the state

Education – building the learning neighbourhood

The power of Education Tackling Educational Disadvantage and Inequality

In modern society education is one of the most powerful tools we have to transform the lives of individuals and the communities they come from. It is vital that the resources available to invest in education are spent wisely and equitably. Sadly this is not the case in Ireland today. There is widespread inequity and educational disadvantage.

€6.6 billion will be spent on education in the 26 Counties in 2004. The National Development Plan envisages spending another €5.350 billion on education and training between now and 2006.

While these figures seem significant they are low by international and EU comparisons meaning that educational disadvantage is prevalent in all aspects of the education system. Seven years of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats have led to:

(1) Over 500 run down school buildings;
(2) A lack of special needs teachers. Children with special education needs are still being accommodated in classes of up to 30 pupils with no specialist assistance;
(3) A 20% secondary school drop out rate;
(4) Widespread functional illiteracy, running to 24% of the adult population according to the UN Human Development Report;
(5) Huge inequalities in terms of access to and participation in third level.

This state is in the bottom seven spenders in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of primary education and the bottom nine spenders for second level education.

Denmark, Switzerland, the US, Austria and Norway all spend $6,000 or more per annum on their pupils while the coalition Government here only spends $3,000 on each pupil. Classroom sizes here are also among the highest in the OECD.

The National Economic and Social Council estimated in 2001 that 16% of the school-going population is educationally disadvantaged. This means 132,000 children are receiving a substandard education every day.

With knowledge and education seen as key to future economic development on the island the extent of educational disadvantage and the Government failure to deal with it is all the more shocking.

Sinn Fein councillors will work for:
• Streamlining of existing projects designed to tackle educational disadvantage, with the funding allowances and planning powers been centred under the remit of local government
• Provision of VEC and local authority-run breakfast and homework clubs and other similar schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage
• Increased funding and provision of early start preschool programmes for disadvantaged children
• Increased funding for back to school allowances, especially for footwear, clothing and books
• A repeal of the 37% reduction of maintenance funds for childcare centres
• A repeal of the capping of enrolment numbers on PLC courses
• A reverse in the decision to cut funding for Phase 2 of the Community Strand of the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI)
• Reducing the pupil teacher ratio in disadvantaged areas
• Increasing the proportion of the education budget allocated to tackle educational disadvantage to 15% without cutting back other services.
• Increasing the amount of third level places for mature students
• Proper funding for college expenses such as accommodation, travel, subsistence, text books etc
• Delivering broadband services and technology labs to every primary and secondary school with adequate teaching and curriculum support available to maximise the use of these resources
• Ending the chronic underfunding of the National Education Psychological Services, (NEPS).

Huge sections of the country, predominantly in rural areas, are not covered by this service at all. 57% of schools in the North West are not covered with even higher figures for the even worse for the mid-west

Development Plans & Planning

Community central to planning process

Central to Sinn Féin’s goal of an Ireland of Equals is enabling people to play a substantial role in decisions regarding the development of their own local areas and in the management of local and community resources.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for:
• Greater community involvement in the planning process as a basic starting point of all development plans
• The drafting of development plans on the principles of sustainable development
• Development plans to make the best use of existing space and buildings in urban centres by promoting increased density in towns and the regeneration of inner city areas, in order to combat suburban sprawl
• Development plans to focus on developing brown field sites
• Rural regeneration to be prioritised
• Proper and consistent implementation and enforcement of planning guidelines
• An integrated and community centred approach to all development. Housing projects to be built in conjunction with social amenities such as schools, health facilities, childcare facilities, retail outlets and an adequate , accessible and affordable local public transport infrastructure.
• The establishment of best practice guidelines on housing mix in new developments, dwelling size, size of green areas, provision of play-ground facilities and common areas and overall environmental impact
• Recognition of the right of people living in an area to build a family home in that area.
• All development plans to provide for the specific needs of young people and the elderly in terms of facilities and amenities
• Development plans promote the cultural and civic life of the community
• Planning authorities should insist that all new and all restructured commercial and public buildings be wheelchair accessible. All buildings where food and/or drink are consumed should be accessible and have a properly laid out disabled toilet
• A specific certification from a qualified member of either the Association of Building Engineers or the Royal Institute of Architechts of Ireland as to whether the plans meet universal design standards must accompany the planning application
• No grants should be paid by Government/EU agencies for publicly used buildings eg: recreation/sports centres unless such certification has been provided with the planning application. In the case of buildings with more than one storey, grants should be withheld until the lift is installed and operational
• All footpaths should be dished ie path surface and road surface exactly flush to enable those on wheels to proceed safely. Visually impaired people should have the benefit of ‘bleeped’ crossings and tactile slabs at crossings

Rural Development and Agriculture

Sinn Fein’s commitment to Rural Life

The problems facing rural communities require a radical new approach to the whole question of rural development in the state. We support the right of all citizens to equal access to public service provision and are opposed to any attempt to cut back on education, health, transport, postal service and community policing.

We will ensure that there is real decentralisation of both the public and the private sectors, and that local and regional authorities along with community representatives are given a greater say in the manner in which local programmes are administered.

Sinn Féin councillors will work alongside others to promote measures at local level that will help:
• to maintain vibrant sustainable rural communities
• to provide adequate housing and to ensure that the planning process is fair and is made to serve the interests of local people in a balanced and sustainable way
• to promote locally-based employment
• to improve access to education and training
• to encourage participation in the decision-making process
• to ensure gender balance on Rural Development bodies like LEADER and CLAR
• to promote all-Ireland integration and co-operation
• to ensure balanced regional development
• to maintain local services
• to provide broadband communications for all parts of the state

Securing a Future for Farming

Sinn Féin is committed to revitalising Irish agriculture. At national and European level we support all measures that promote the long-term sustainability of family farms.

Farmers must be given a fairer price for their produce and measures must be taken to curtail the power of the large multiples who charge consumers up to five times what they pay the farmer for food.

Farmers’ markets

Sinn Fein councillors will propose the promotion of farmers’ markets to bring food directly from the farm to the consumer to the benefit of both, where necessary making new retail developments planning approval conditional on the provision of farmers’ market facilities.

Quality products and a GM free Ireland

We see the future of farming being built on the basis of high quality food production and an expanded domestic processing sector, with a return to genuine producer co-operatives playing an enhanced role. We are also adamant that to preserve the reputation of Irish food, the entire island must remain free from Genetically Modified crops.

When elected all Sinn Féin Councillors will table a motion calling for the Council to declare itself a GM free zone.

Justice in the Community

Everyone has the right to feel safe in their homes and communities. Everyone has the right to expect the justice system to protect their security, their rights, and their dignity.

Policing for the People

Sinn Féin wants to see an all-island police service established. In the interim, we want policing services North and South that can attract widespread support from, and that are seen as an integral part of, the communities they serve. We want effective, human rights-compliant policing with local democratic accountability, shaped as a community service and imbued with that ethos.

The Gardaí have not succeeded in making working class communities safe. Many people in these communities are angry at the failure to respond effectively to growing localised crises, and the misallocation of Garda resources.

People have also lost faith in the Gardaí because of the many cases of Garda misconduct - including off-duty criminal involvement in a range of serious offences, findings of fraud in relation to Garda contracts, and revelations that Gardaí have given false evidence in Court. The perception of impunity for these misdeeds has been confirmed by the repeated failures of the present Garda Complaints Board.

The Garda Síochána has remained largely unreformed for 80 years. The time for comprehensive Garda reform is now.

Sinn Féin advocates a comprehensive Garda reform package to support the evolution of the Gardaí towards a best practice service, which can set the standard globally for efficient, effective and accountable policing with human rights at its core. If we introduce the right reforms to create such a policing service, we believe it will enjoy an unprecedented level of community confidence, support, and cooperation. That is our vision. That is the policing service Sinn Féin wants to help realise for the people of this state.

Sinn Féin’s Proposals

Establishment of a fully independent Garda Ombudsman to investigate police misconduct:

• after an open, merit-based appointment, selected on the basis of published criteria
• separate from any body charged with a Garda management function, or with a mandate to review Garda efficiency and effectiveness
• with the necessary legal powers and resources to conduct independent investigations, determine breaches of the Garda disciplinary code, refer evidence of criminality to the DPP, and to resolve complaints by assigning penalties and remedies including recommendations for disciplinary action, changes in police procedure or compensation
• with the power to investigate incidents from the past

Establishment of a Policing Board for civilian oversight:
• independent of Garda management
• representative of the community - composed of one third elected representatives, one third representatives of statutory bodies, and one third representatives from the community/voluntary sector, including at least 50% women and taking the need for other forms of social and economic representation into account
• empowered to request a report from the Garda Commissioner on any matter pertaining to policing, to monitor performance, to make recommendations on resource allocation or policy change, and to set annual strategic objectives and policing plans
• required to meet monthly and in public

Establishment of Community Policing Partnerships at Garda district level for democratic accountability:
• based on equal partnership between Gardaí and the community
• established as committees of the local authority, with membership elected by the local authority following a transparent nomination process, and a representative composition (following the same criteria as the Policing Board above)
• as a forum for dialogue and a mechanism for both Garda accountability and community cooperation
• to conduct monthly public meetings where the District Commander would present reports and answer questions
• to reflect community concerns and make recommendations, including a mechanism for members of the public to address questions to the District Superintendent

Improved deployment of Garda resources:

• a comprehensive review of Garda resource deployment, equipment, training and procedure (including the Disciplinary Code) to ensure effective best practice policing and to complete a process of modernisation – including a local public consultation component
• civilianisation of appropriate Garda administrative posts and the introduction of a dedicated traffic corps under Garda supervision to free up fully trained Gardaí for investigation and patrol duties
• collation and analysis of crime statistics at station and district level, not just at regional or divisional level
• introduction of crime and complaint pattern analysis to provide an information-led approach to policing that addresses causes as well as consequences

Effective Action on Domestic Violence

A significant percentage of violent crimes are committed in the home, by a family member, against a spouse, child or elderly parent.

Everyone has the right to safety and security in their own home. Domestic violence is not acceptable in any form. Sinn Féin supports effective action on domestic abuse in all its forms.

However domestic violence against women is a particularly pervasive problem in Irish society, affecting approximately one in five Irish women. Since children are also affected, it contributes to generational cycles of violence. It devastates at least as many lives as any other anti-social crime, or drugs, and must become a priority for the Government.

Sinn Féin supports a safety and sanctions approach. Sinn Féin local representatives will continue to call for:
• increased secure funding for local crisis and support services for women experiencing violence
• enlargement of the island network of refuges and an expansion of their capacity so that no woman in need will be turned away
• awareness raising and education around the issue of domestic and other violence against women, including the training of the Gardaí and all staff involved in the judicial process, including judges
• increased resources for family law courts to alleviate delays, and for expert reports on custody and access issues in domestic violence cases
• reinstatement of the Civil Legal Aid Private Practitioners’ Scheme to allow victims of domestic violence priority access to legal advice and representation
• amendment of the Domestic Violence Act to remove the residence requirement on barring and safety orders, which excludes some women in need of protection
• rehabilitation programmes for offenders, available on request without delay.

Tackling the Drugs Problem

Facing up to the new challenges

Drug dependence and drug crime are increasing in Irish society and are doing untold damage to users, their families and communities.

There is a pressing need to rethink the current anti-drug strategies, which aren’t working. We need to ensure that we duplicate the successes rather than the mistakes of other countries in tackling this social problem. We need drug policies based on international best practice. Not only do we question the effectiveness of the present National Drug Strategy, we question the Government’s commitment to it.

We are also concerned about Government inaction on escalating alcohol abuse and the growing cocaine problem in Dublin.

Sinn Fein has a long record of engagement with affected communities on the drugs issue, and we will continue to make it a priority.

Sinn Féin local representatives will fight for:
• The doubling of funding to the Drugs Task Forces. The current allocation is woefully inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem.
• The formulation, funding and implementation of new strategies for dealing with cocaine and crack cocaine addiction, with an emphasis on community-based pilot projects using international best practice.
• The rolling out of effective drug education in schools and communities, based on international best practice models.
• Increased priority funding of the RAPID Programme as an investment in the future, recognising that the drug problem is most acute in urban areas suffering social and economic disadvantage. Tackling disadvantage is a bottom-line requirement of effective action on drugs.
• Holistic and comprehensive approaches to providing drug treatment programmes and other services for drug users. Such services should be responsive to the diversity of individual, family and community needs, and not limited to methadone maintenance or 12 step programmes only.
• Recognition of the positive role CE schemes play as training and employment for individual drug addicts in a rehabilitation process, but also of the important social and economic contribution made to the local communities by the schemes, services and projects themselves.
• Provision of residential care so that women with children can receive addiction treatment.
• Extended fostering allowances to give greater support to extended families especially grandparents for their role providing parenting for the children of addicts.
• More resourcing for the Garda Drugs Squads within the policing budget. There also needs to be accountability and community involvement in how those resources are spent. This should happen at the Garda District level as this would make the greatest impact on the ground in communities.
• More aggressive pursuit of major drug traffickers by the state, ensuring that the bigger players are caught, tried, and receive appropriate and consistent sentences.

Enterprise and Employment

Sinn Féin envisages a society where everyone can have a dignified, productive and well-paid job and can have a fair income and better quality of life. This Government does not have the same ambition and the last year has seen them direct cuts at the most vulnerable in society particularly those on Community Employment (CE) and Jobs Initiative (JI) schemes. The much-heralded Sustaining Progress agreement represents a poor deal for workers, particularly those in low-paid jobs.

Sinn Féin believes that local government and local government representatives have a key role to play in promoting indigenous industry as a means to bring about sustainable job creation and economic development within the local authority area. In this regard it is important to recognise that the bulk of employment stems from small and medium-sized enterprises.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for:

Enterprise
• Review of functioning and management of City and County Development Boards and City and County Enterprise Boards with the objective of making them more responsive to the needs of local communities and enterprise, and with a view to making these boards increasingly accountable to reformed local authorities
• Reform of the process by which appointments to these boards are made, to increase accountability and openness.
• City and County Development Boards to place a greater emphasis on counteracting social exclusion.
• The same quantity and quality of resources made available to inward investors to be made available to indigenous enterprises.
• Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to made available to people who have been unemployed for over one year, which would act as an effective tool to assist people to set up business and move off welfare.
• Increased accessibility and relevance of enterprise supports for women travellers and minorities returning to employment.
• Funding to be made available for the establishment of community-based co-operative enterprises.
• More support for small businesses, which are often overlooked by the industrial development agencies.
• Developing new local brands. Many small businesses are not, in themselves, large enough to enter export markets. With the right guidance and support from Enterprise Ireland they could begin joint ventures to develop, produce and market products outside of Ireland. The Fuchsia Brand developed in West Cork and the Homethrown Irish pottery network are good examples of the development of a regional and national brands encompassing a number of small companies.
• Matching funds for local business. The industrial development bodies should provide the same level of support and funding for indigenous business as is currently provided to inward investment projects;
• The inclusion of penalty clauses in all agreements with companies receiving Government grants, in the event of the company pulling out.

Employment
• The immediate reinstatement of 5000 CE places and Job Initiative places which have been cut by the Government.
• Implemention of the Government’s own commitment to mainstream all funding and services for people with disabilities and the elderly, currently delivered through CE schemes.
• Redundancy payments to be increased to three weeks of pay per year of service.
• Fulfillment of the NAPS commitment to “eliminate long-term unemployment as soon as circumstances permit, but in any case not later than 2007”
• The needs of the working poor to be addressed, providing access to quality, better paid and stable jobs, enabling all workers to earn a sustainable living wage.
• Positive incentives including training, support and career guidance, rather than forcing people to accept poor quality low-paid employment
• Enabling workers to take up employment. Many people are unable to find or take up employment as a result of poor education, carer responsibilities for children or elderly family members. People with disabilities or asylum seekers also face impediments.
• Workplace safety to be made a priority
• Equal access for all to good quality childcare for all, regardless of income
• Adaptation of social protection systems to the needs of part-time workers and other atypical workers, including those caring for dependents
• Extended maternity benefit, from 18 weeks to 26 weeks
• Guaranteed social security rights for atypical workers
• A specific strategy to tackle high rates of unemployment among disabled workers
• Retention of disabled workers’ secondary benefits for a substantial period of time
• Effective supports for the public and private sector to recruit people with disabilities
• Effective enforcement mechanisms and remedies regarding the employment quota for the recruitment of people with disabilities
• Comprehensive needs assessments for people with disabilities to direct them to the appropriate service around their education, training and employment needs
• The implementation of the NESC report ‘Labour Market issues for Older Workers’ (2003)
• The right to work (and pay taxes) while asylum applications are in process.

Transport - Accessible Reliable & Public

Seven years of failure

The Department of Transport declares its objective “To ensure the provision, development and regulation of competitive, safe and secure integrated transport services and transport infrastructure for the road, rail and air transport modes in Ireland”.

The reality is a chronically under-funded public transport network, traffic gridlock in urban centres and on major national roads, billions poured into road building without any cost-benefit analysis and critically flawed proposals to break up CIE. The spending on road building is currently double the €3.5 billion earmarked for public transport.

Alongside this is the virtual absence of a rural community-based transport system. In most parts of rural Ireland private cars are the only form of transport. This has left whole communities abandoned, as well as depriving them of access to health, education and often employment opportunities. A Fianna Fail commissioned survey in 2000 found that one third of the rural population has no access to transport. Nothing has changed in the last four years of the Fianna Fail/Progressive Democrat Government to change this fact.

In January 2004, a European expert on transport revealed that this state failed every single one of 27 indicators of good transport policy. The incompetence of this Government is making a shambles out of our transport system.

A study carried out in 2000 by the UCD Economics Department found that Dublin had the third lowest average subsidy rate for urban bus services in Europe. Although investment in public transport has increased since 2000 and CIE is modernising its systems, the Government is set to break it up and model our public transport system on the disastrous, expensive and unsafe British model.

Value for Money

Sinn Féin believes we need to seriously examine whether the billions invested in road building is providing value for money. We need to know why we have to pay for the roads through taxes and then again through road tolls, to see the profits end up in the pockets of private companies. Sinn Féin believes that public transport should be a priority and opposes the needless break up of CIE. We will work for an All-Ireland transport system and transport policy, which provides quality, reliable and cheap public transport.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:

Backing the Bus
• A proper system of bus corridors and bicycle lanes in our cities and major investment in quality buses to provide extra hours and routes
• A School Bus Authority, co-ordinated at local government level in both urban and rural areas

Revaluating the roads
• An immediate evaluation of the economic and environmental impact of the massive road building programme currently under way
• Opposition to road-tolling.

Rebuilding the rail network
• The Government must commit itself to a time limited strategic investment in a public owned and run rail-network that increases capacity and quality of services on existing routes while developing proper regional rail networks.
• Investment in the Western Rail Corridor from Derry/Letterkenny to Ennis and a time limited programme for rolling out regional rail services including the Dublin Derry line.
• Implementation of an integrated ticketing policy, including LUAS, as part of our public transport strategy.
• Full integration of LUAS into Dublin bus and rail services, and extension of LUAS to West Tallaght.
• Appropriate park-and-ride facilities for DART and rail stations.

Keeping Transport Public
• Opposing the break up of Aer Rianta and any attempt to sell off Aer Lingus
• Opposing the break-up of CIE and the privatisation of Dublin Bus

All Ireland dimension

Partition has lead to the development of two transport infrastructures on the island. Sinn Fein supports complete integration of transport infrastructure including the N2/A5 route and M1/A1 routes. Partnerships such as those that exist between Translink and CIE need to be strengthened with one publicly owned transport company for the island.

Multiculturism

In a dramatically short space of time, Ireland has gone from an almost monocultural nation, to one with people of various colours, creeds and cultures. Our society is radically changing.

The response of the Government and elements of the media to this changes has left a lot to be desired. Immigrants and asylum seekers have been dehumanised and portrayed as spongers, criminals and welfare cheats. ‘Ireland of the Welcomes’ has become a thing of the past.

Sinn Féin believes that we should embrace our growing diversity as a source of strength, opportunity and economic dynamism. To do this we must begin by opposing racism, discrimination and intolerance of any kind, wherever it occurs. We must challenge the stigmatisation of non-nationals and of Irish citizens with non-national parents. The discriminatory policies of this Government must come to an end.

All Sinn Féin candidates have been through anti-racist training facilitated by the National Consultative Council on Racism and Interculturalism and have individually signed an anti-racist pledge. We are committed to a multicultural Ireland.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• The establishment of Anti-Racism Networks facilitated, resourced and supported by local councils to develop policy, co-ordinate community activity and liaise on a cross-sectoral basis.
• Increased resources for minority ethnic NGOs, as well as anti-racist organisations
• An end to the system of Direct Provision and forced dispersal of asylum seekers and its replacement by the right to work and the freedom to choose one’s place of residence
• Retaining the equal right of citizenship for all children born in Ireland
• Opposing racism in whatever form it appears in our communities
• The adoption of an anti-racist charter by all local authorities and their services.
• Campaigning for the government to reverse it policy regarding the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group and to repeal the Housing Act 2002 which criminalises Travellers
• A broader, meaningful Traveller-Settled reconciliation process, where Traveller and settled communities come into conflict

A Charter for Senior Citizens

Sinn Féin believes that creating the conditions for an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups need enhanced protection from the state.

Sinn Féin recognises that senior citizens have made a lifetime contribution to our society through their work, their taxes, rates, insurance contributions and voluntary work in their communities. We are calling for a fundamental review to examine whether the standard of living of our senior citizens meets their needs and reflects the contribution they make.

Poverty has no place in our society, yet the incomes of many senior citizens are falling radically behind that of society as a whole. Our senior citizens, many of whom have been forced to retire, are living on inadequate pensions and struggling with spiralling costs of living. They also have to battle against society’s attitudes towards those marginalized, particularly as a result of low income.

It is vital that mechanisms are developed to properly value and recognise the lifelong contribution of our senior citizens to society as a whole and to social cohesion.

While senior citizens have concerns and needs particular to their personal circumstances, their concern is also for society as a whole. The quality of life for their children and grandchildren, for the following generations, is as important to them as their own welfare.

It is essential that there is a consultation process with Senior Citizens on all issues pertaining to their and their wider community’s welfare.

Sinn Féin’s councillors will work for:
• The fundamental review of the standard of living of senior citizens, including pension provision, cost of living, fuel poverty and disposable income
• Year on year targets to eliminate unnecessary deaths from cold
• Simplification and streamlining of grants application system for adaptation work for access to basic amenities in the home
• Design of streets and roads as safe environments for senior citizens
• Introduction of free personal care
• An adequate level of nursing care in residential accommodation
• Fair access to health care for senior citizens based on clinical need
• Extension of resources available for home security
• More resources for community-based initiatives that promote social inclusion
• Free telephone line rental, free TV licenses and examination of the potential of free Internet access
