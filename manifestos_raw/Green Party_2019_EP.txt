OUR VISION

The Green Party believes in Europe.

The Green Party believes in Europe. In union with our sister Green Parties around the EU we believe that through reform and development the European project can deliver a society that places social equality and climate justice at the heart of its work. We believe in a union of goals and principles, not for financial gains for the few, but in economic and social progress for all.

A union that leads the world by protecting people and the planet. Now is the time to fulfil that promise. Now is the time for the Greens. We are a truly European movement united by our vision, mission and passion.

From Ireland to Georgia, from Norway to Malta, we fight for human dignity, sustainability, equality, peace and solidarity.

We do it in the parliaments, we do it on the streets and we do it in our communities.

THE CHALLENGES

We know that today Europe faces some of the greatest challenges in its history. New, politically extreme groups, using aggressive tactics and the temptation of hatred to trick and force their way into power are gaining ground while politicians who promote the status quo are failing to enact real change.

The idea of the European Union as a project for peace and social justice can seem remote at times.

Our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom, has decided to leave the European Union, and other forces want to weaken it. Authoritarianism, racism, terrorism and the threat of further economic uncertainty have eroded the sense of security for many Europeans.

The financial crisis and austerity policies left millions in poverty, while big multinational corporations avoid taxes. People fleeing war and persecution exposed governments unwilling to help, while Europe as a whole is wealthier than ever. The climate crisis threatens to rapidly undo the very foundations on which we build and develop our communities.

Never before has Europe needed the clear, fair and ambitous voice of green politics.

Now is the time for action.

THE WAY FORWARD

The Green Party is working towards a democratic and inclusive Europe that is socially just and environmentally sustainable. We need an economy that serves both current and future generations. We need a Europe that bears its global responsibility and leaves no one behind.

The European Union is far from perfect but it can be a powerful force for good.

We can build on what has been achieved – and change what has not worked. We know that remaking Europe will not be easy. We are committed to working hard every day with people, organisations and movements fighting for change across the continent, and our support is growing.

Over the years, our persistent work has delivered many successes. With the Greens playing a leading role, Europe has taken important steps to invest in renewable energy, secure people’s privacy online, improve recycling, and ban harmful pesticides.

Thanks to Green leadership, Europe is moving towards protecting whistleblowers who expose information in the public interest, taking action against authoritarian governments, banning unnecessary plastics, and fighting tax evasion by big corporations – just to give a few examples.

A vote for the Greens makes a real difference. Join us - It is time to renew the promise of Europe.

THE RIGHT TO INHERIT A LIVABLE PLANET

We believe in a Europe that leads the world in a just transition to sustainable societies. Greening our economy is an historic opportunity to create jobs and improve our quality of life while making sure no one is left behind. Climate crisis, destruction of nature and overuse of resources threaten the foundations of our well-being and wealth – even our security. Human progress can only take place within planetary boundaries.

Europe has to lead the way on climate action, making the Paris Agreement a reality. We want the EU to pursue all possible efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

• Carbon.
We are calling for a European climate law, with binding carbon budgets reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and building a net-zero emissions economy. This must include restoring natural carbon sinks in forests and soils.

• Energy.
Not a single euro from taxpayers should finance fossil fuels.
Europe must phase out coal by 2030 and other fossil fuels, including gas, as soon as possible thereafter. Nuclear power and fracking have no role to play in the clean energy future.

• Waste.
Non-recyclable plastics must be taxed or banned, sustainable alternatives developed, and recycling and reuse targets raised. We propose strict limits on exporting waste and the introduction of taxes on the extraction and import of raw materials.

TRANSPORT

Building a sustainable transport system requires vision and commitment:

Investing in railways, connecting European countries and regions with more accessible and affordable infrastructure, focusing funding and effort on sustainable and active travel.

Overall, stronger public transportation as well as reducing the necessity for transport can remedy traffic congestion and pollution across Europe.

• Ban on Fossil-Fuel Cars.
We propose that no new fossil-fuel cars be sold in Europe after 2030. The Union must support the creation of low-emission zones in towns and cities across Europe and promote cycling and walking.

• Funds.
Funding for sustainable transport must be redirected from subsidies for air travel through the introduction of a European flight tax, European VAT on tickets as well as ending the kerosene tax exemption for airplanes.

PROTECTING NATURE ON LAND AND AT SEA

Determined action on the environment can improve the lives of millions of Europeans. Today, air pollution alone causes more than 400,000 early deaths every year in the EU – and weakens the quality of life for millions more. The seas around Europe are choking with plastic and our natural world is in crisis as species struggle against pollution and habitat destruction. The Green Party have fought long and hard to protect our natural world.

• Protected Areas. 
We propose to expand protected areas significantly, ensure they cover key ecosystems, and guarantee that the protection promised them in law really works.

• Forestry. 
We propose stronger tools to address deforestation related to land management, imported food and other products.

• Marine Areas. 
We want to increase marine protected areas to 20% of our seas. Controls of sulphur emissions from shipping must be extend ed to all coasts and heavy fuel oil banned in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.

• Fish Stocks. 
Fishing seasonal closures allowing fish stocks to recover should be complied with by all Member States. Illegal fishing must be stopped and any fish imported from outside the single market must meet European conservation standards.

• Trawling.
We propose to end deep-sea bottom trawling and other particularly destructive forms of industrial fishing and limit the impact of bottom-contact fisheries on eco-systems.

ECONOMY

Our current economy is based on taking resources from nature, making products, using them and then throwing them away. This linear model must be replaced with a circular economy, creating more value and using fewer resources, while making sure this does not lead to more hazardous substances. Instead of continuously consuming more resources, we need to consume smarter and in moderation.

• Circular Economy. 
We propose encourage manufacturers to create products that last longer, to promote repair and ‘first fix free’ strategies. We also propose increasing the duration of warranties to combat planned obsolescence.

• A Caring Economy. 
As demographics change and we move towards circular economies we believe an opportuntity exists to build a society that is more fair, social, collaborative. New forms of economy can combine profitability with social inclusion and democratic governance. European regulation should enable alternative tools, such as cooperatives, crowdfunding and social entrepreneurship.

• GDP. 
Gross domestic product alone is an inadequate measure of economic progress. We want to complement it with alternative metrics that reflect social and environmental concerns.

• Digital Sector. 
We call for an effective and independent EU authority for digital sector supervision in order to control and limit the market power of big corporations.

• SMEs. 
Smarter regulation should guarantee SMEs a fair playing field with big companies and competition regulation must be reformed accordingly.

• Buying Power. 
More sustainable public procurement can be a driving force to green the economy. We want a more systematic use of social, environmental and fair-trade criteria when public bodies buy products and services.

• Trade. 
We will continue to work for open and fair-trade policies, provided they are based on international rules, transparent processes and that they enhance – not endanger – the rights of workers, farmers and consumers, animal welfare and the protection of health and the environment.

• Negotiations. 
We favour progress in the WTO and multilateral agreements over bilateral trade deals. The Paris Agreement, international labour standards rules and Sustainable Development Goals must form the foundation of trade treaties.

• Tax. 
We propose ecological tax reform: taxing more what we want less of (resource use and pollution) and taxing less what we want more of (jobs). Europe should require Member States to raise taxes on fossil fuels and consider environmental taxes at the European level, for example on flights and plastics.

• Transparency. 
We propose to introduce stronger measures to combat market manipulation and improve transparency on the financial markets. We propose a financial transaction tax to limit speculation and to finance sustainable investments.

• Tax Justice. 
Europe must take stronger measures to close tax havens, fight evasion and tax avoidance, both outside and inside the Union. More harmonisation on what is taxed and how, such as a strong common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) for large companies and a minimum corporate tax rate, would reduce harmful competition between Member States.

Beyond committing to this common framework, Member States should retain the ability to address inherent disadvantages in their economies.

Benefits emanating from the reduction of tax avoidance should in turn also be utilised for European investments to decrease social inequality and support disadvantaged and peripheral communities.

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE

The way we produce and consume food makes a big difference to our health, environment and animals.

We want to reform Europe’s common agricultural policy to move from industrial agriculture to sustainable forms of farming, such as organic and agro-ecological solutions.

Sustainable agriculture helps cut emissions, save bees, revitalise rural communities and keep our food safe.
• Farming. We propose to redirect agricultural subsidies to sustainable farming, based on fair and results-based conditions that protect small to medium farmers and focus on land management.
• Pesticides. We propose that harmful pesticides such as glyphosate, and similar equals, should be banned.
• Reducing Meat Consumption. In conjunction with sustainable land use we propose to support farmers to expand their output profile and increase the production of non meat based products.
• Animal Welfare. Animals have the right to live free from abuse, which is why we are calling for a ban on fur farming and transporting live animals long distances.

SOCIAL EQUALITY

We want to build a Europe that offers everyone a fair chance, with a sustainable economy and tax justice. Everyone in Europe should have the right to a decent income and basic public services.

We believe that the EU must urgently reform the economic system so that it works for the people and respects our planetary boundaries. Environmental damage often disproportionately impacts those who are already struggling, not to mention future generations. The Green Party will work for fairness and equality.
• Just Transistion. A special European scheme should be set up to finance retraining and moving to new jobs, providing social security and alleviating fears.
• Poverty. We reject austerity measures that have resulted in increasing poverty and deteriorating public services.
• Basic Income. To make the European Pillar of Social Rights a reality, we call for introducing European legislation to secure adequate minimum income schemes in all European countries.
• Housing. Public investments in social, affordable and energy-efficient housing should be supported with European funds.
• Tenancy Rights. We believe in nationally funded, locally delivered approach towards public housing policy and that we must protect those who rent properties from exploitation. Every person must have their right to a home recognised by national governement.
• Health. The EU should support Member States to achieve universal health coverage, reduce health inequalities and ensure access to medicines. We want more focus on preventing both physical and mental health problems, not just treating them.
• Access to Medicines. Drug policy needs to be based on evidence, not prejudice. European countries should reform drug policies to help – not punish – people suffering from substance abuse.
• Disablity. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities must be implemented and audited by all member states at both a local and national level.
• Access to Services. People with disabilities must be included in decisions which concern them, including having full access to voting. All public services, including transport should be accessible to all.

WORK

Work can provide income, community and purpose. To create quality jobs and prepare job-seekers for them, a wide range of measures is needed from both businesses and society, from retraining and upskilling to supporting social entrepreneurship and setting up small businesses.
• Labour Rights.
We support the right of workers to organise in trade unions as well as collective bargaining, social dialogue and worker participation.

• Gig Economy.
We propose to update labour rules and welfare regimes so that they recognise the changing nature of work, also protecting self-employed people and workers in the gig and platform economy.

• Flexible Working.
In response to the changing nature of work we propose that to introduce employer guidelines to support reducing and redistributing working hours when requested.

• Corporate Responsibility.
The Union and Member States must introduce rules to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – and guarantee people access to justice when companies break these rules.

EDUCATION AND RESEARCH

Education is a tool for people to improve their lives, understand the world and engage in society. It is also an investment in the future as educated and skilled people are the foundation of both a vibrant economy and functioning democracy. We want to make Europe the world leader in both education and research.

• A Vision for Education.
Our long-term vision is free and accessible education for all to reduce education inequality.

• Research.
We propose to increase funding for independent research and innovation considerably to meet big societal challenges, following the success of the Horizon 2020 programme.

• Erasmus.
The Erasmus+ exchange must be broadened and strengthened to really enable people from all backgrounds to work, train or study in another country.

GENERATIONAL EQUALITY

Years after the financial crisis, young Europeans continue to face a number of challenges. In some countries, youth unemployment is still as high as 40% (Spain, Greece). Many feel understandable anxiety about the future, witnessing the inaction by status-quo politicians. In parallel the proportion of older people is rising rapidly. Senior Europeans have a lot to offer, from passing on experience at work to volunteering in civil society, which should lead to some sort of recognition. No one should need to live in poverty because they have retired.

• Equality.
We propose an end to age related banding in social payments for younger people, quality jobs, a ban on discriminatory youth wages and proper pay for internships.

• Youth Guarantee.
The Youth Guarantee should be made mandatory for all Member States; making the guarantee of stable, paid and quality employment its primary goal.

• Volunteering.
We call for sufficient funding for the volunteering strand of the European Solidarity Corps that gives young people the opportunity and the financial means to develop their own volunteering projects.

• Mature Learning.
Senior workers must have the right to lifelong learning. People should be allowed to retire flexibly, for example by combining reduced working hours with part-time pensions.

DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM

Democracy, the rule of law and human rights have been increasingly challenged both within Europe and internationally. In these troubled times, Europe can be a beacon of hope.

The Union must play a stronger role in defending and deepening the foundations of open societies. We want a vibrant democracy on all levels:

From local to regional, national, European and international.

• Protection.
We propose to increase support for investigative journalism and defend journalists under threat. Whistle-blowers – people exposing information in the public interest – must be vigorously protected.

• Net Neutrality.
We defend net neutrality – the principle that all data must be treated equally – as a foundation of the open internet.

• Data Protection.
Recently introduced European data protection rules must be fully implemented. Electronical communication has to be end-to-end encrypted. We strongly reject any kind of data retention without cause.

• Voting Age.
We propose setting the age of voting and candidacy at 16 years in the European elections. This would give youth a stronger voice in making decisions that shape our common future.

• Participation.
We propose to radically increase transparency in European institutions, including the European Central Bank. All positions taken by Member States in the Council should be made public. We propose a mandatory legislative footprint for EU laws and a binding lobby register for all EU institutions.

• Migration.
Europe must establish legal and safe channels for migration.

We reject any plans for controlled centres or regional disembarkation platforms outside of the EU.

• International Solidarity.
Europe needs to increase funding for international development and humanitarian action. Member states should allocate at least 0.7% of their economy to supporting people in need abroad. The Sustainable Development Goals provide a good blueprint for EU activities.

• Peace.
We oppose redirecting European funds towards military purposes. Lasting security and stability cannot be built with weapons.
We call for a ban on arms exports. To maintain peace, Europe also needs a common security and defence policy.

• Monetary Policy.
The EU needs a substantially more ambitious and effective budget to fulfil its tasks, co-decided by the European Parliament. We call on the Union to explore participatory budgeting, allowing people to have a direct say in how a part of their money is used.

• Reform.
The intergovernmental structures of the euro-zone, such as the Fiscal Compact and European Stability Mechanism (ESM), must be profoundly reformed and integrated into the EU.
