Introduction

This year’s local and European Elections are taking place at a time when Ireland is facing many challenges – an ongoing housing crisis, a health service that is at breaking point and a cost-of-living crisis. These elections are an opportunity for people to have their say on the change they want to see.

We have a government that is out of touch, that doesn’t understand the challenges workers and families are facing, doesn’t have the ideas or the capacity to fix them, and doesn’t give our local Councils the resources and the funds to deliver for communities.

Change starts in your local community, with your local Sinn Féin councillor working hard for you to make sure your Council works better for you. Better delivery of social and affordable housing. Better delivery of local services and amenities. Better maintenance of our roads and making our streets safer.

Local Councils will be crucial to the delivering affordable homes for workers and families under a Sinn Féin led government. That is why a vote for Sinn Féin in the local elections on 7th June is a vote to start fixing the housing crisis.

Sinn Féin’s commitment to you is that we will make sure your voice in heard at local level. Politics works best when decisions are taken closest to those impacted and when the views of communities is heard.

Sinn Féin councillors will work hard for you. We will make it our business to ensure that your Council delivers for you.

Our priorities include:

– Putting the delivery of social and affordable housing back at the top of the Council agenda.

– Making your Council work better for you; consulting, listening, and delivering for the community.

– Tackling red tape and delays at local authority level, particularly in relation to planning and the delivery of housing and infrastructure.

– Getting local Councils back doing the things they once did well including the maintenance of roads, delivering local services - including waste services, cleaning our streets, and delivering and maintaining homes for which they are responsible.

– Supporting communities working hard to improve their local areas by investing in public spaces, leisure and sports facilities, transport infrastructure and the local environment.

Building Public Housing on Public Land

After 13 years of Fine Gael in Government, home ownership has collapsed. Workers and families can’t afford to buy and they can’t afford to rent.

Instead of building homes Fine Gael have spent almost €10billion of taxpayers money on subsidies to landlords (HAP/RAS/Rent Supplement/Long Term Leasing).

Almost 140,000 households are in need of social housing many waiting more than 10 years for a home. Vulture funds are still being allowed to buy up family homes.

The average house price is now €330,000 rising to €440,000 in Dublin – more than three times the maximum mortgage that most young people can get.

Some local authorities are leaving homes empty for over 22 months between tenants with homes left boarded up .

Local authorities are one of the biggest employers across the state but the majority have taken on no craft apprentices in 2023, Dublin City which the biggest local authority only took on 37 apprentices.

There are 166,752 vacant homes. In 2022 less than €1million was collected in the Derelict Sites Levy with eighteen local authorities collecting nothing.

Homelessness has reached levels never thought imaginable with almost 14,000 people including over 4,000 children officially homeless.

There are ongoing difficulties faced by people in rural Ireland when trying to obtain planning permission for a single house, often on family land.

There are people, living in Council homes and private rentals, who are forced to live in substandard conditions - in damp, mouldy or unmaintained homes.

Sinn Féin are the only party with a plan to deliver the biggest house building programme in the history of the State. We will deliver affordable homes through local Councils and Approved Housing Bodies at prices people can genuinely afford, ensuring their delivery in the main, through the use of public land. This is alongside the delivery of social homes and delivery of a wider range of homes by the private sector at all sorts of price points. Capacity, pace, and affordability are all key but also core is political prioritisation. Local authorities have a vital role to play in our planning system and need to be properly resourced.

A Sinn Féin government would also put one month’s rent back into every private renters pocket and ban rent increases for three years.

Local Councils will be crucial to the delivery of affordable homes for ordinary workers and families under a Sinn Féin led government.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Delivering the biggest public housing programme in the history of the State to meet social and affordable housing need.

– Delivering affordable homes on an unprecedented scale that teachers, nurses, factory and retail workers can actually afford to buy or rent.

– Stopping vulture funds buying up family homes and student housing.

– Development Plans are robust in supporting local authorities to work to end the housing crisis.

– Speed up the construction of homes by reducing bureaucracy and red tape which is delaying the delivery of housing; Working with homeless service providers to end long-term homelessness.

– Ensuring local development plans support the survival of rural communities; Use compulsory purchase, where practical, and return to use derelict and vacant properties.

– Ensuring greater collection of the Derelict Sites Levy and speed up the return of vacant Council homes.

– Delivering increased housing maintenance budgets and working towards every local authority producing a five-year rolling preventative maintenance plan.

– Ensure we have the workers to build and maintain homes by creating more places for construction related apprenticeships.

– Including the needs of local Gaeltacht and Irish speaking communities at the heart of City/County Development Plans, including their social and affordable housing needs, and in the case of local authorities serving Gaeltacht areas, implementing measures including language impact assessments, language conditions on housing developments, and the recognition of Gaeltacht settlement patterns, to protect communities and support Irish speaking workers and families to make a life for themselves in the Gaeltacht.

Health

While the provision of health services falls under the HSE and the funding is provided by the Department of Health, there is a strong role local authorities can play in increasing health and wellbeing for everyone. Some of these, such as the provision of Primary Care Centres, involve local government working together with the HSE and central government.

Others, such as the provision of playgrounds and walking routes, are direct responsibilities of local authorities. The provision and maintenance of quality public spaces, leisure and other community facilities are means through which Councils can have a real impact. It must also be recognised that deprivation and poor living conditions have direct impacts on people’s health and wellbeing.

Sinn Féin councillors will champion local health services. Regional Health Forums provide an opportunity for councillors to deliver strong, effective local services such as sufficient GP care, more out of hours GP services, enhanced care in the community and to make better use of pharmacies through delivering a Pharmacy First model.

In their local health forums, Sinn Féin councillors will champion:

– Investment in local health services to deliver more GPs, directly hired GPs working in communities and more out of hours GP care.

– Delivery of a Pharmacy First model to make best use of community pharmacists to ensure speedier access to medicines and delivery of a minor ailment scheme.

– Youth mental health services and investment in local supports.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will:

– Prioritise the delivery of recreational amenities; including public spaces and leisure facilities.

– Working with communities to ensure everyone has access to clean, safe green areas to walk and play.

– Put in place a meaningful programme of footpath restoration so everyone can walk and move around their local area safely.

– Work with the NTA to discuss reforming the Active Travel Scheme to include existing footpaths and walkways that need maintenance.

– Ensuring public land is available, and correctly zoned, for Primary Care Centres included in the Sláintecare Plan.

– Establishing a taskforce in each individual local authority to resolve mould and damp issues in social housing.

– Work with local authorities to develop policies to ensure that those entering addiction treatment or hospital stays do not lose their housing entitlement upon discharge.

Cost of Living

A Sinn Féin government would take action to reduce the burden on workers and families because of the rising cost of living. We recognise that local authorities can play an active role in reducing the burden on workers, families, and local communities.

Management of waste is now more important than ever as the climate emergency requires comprehensive actions, including the development of the circular economy, with the aim of eliminating waste. But it is still the case that too much of the burden is borne by workers and families, and far too little by the industries that generate waste.

Household bills for waste collection are adding to the cost of living. Household waste collection was once a core service provided by local Councils. Now it is a lucrative industry, with the cost being borne by the service user. In parallel, the problem of illegal dumping has grown; with Councils picking up the cost.

We are the only state in Europe with a completely privatised waste collection service. We are also the only EU state persisting with ‘side by side’ competition for waste collection, leading to multiple companies driving through residential communities, often on successive days, adding to pollution and traffic problems.

Our privatised system is expensive, bad for the environment and severely lacking controls and regulations. Sinn Féin is committed to putting waste collection back under the control of local authorities. Sinn Féin would introduce the successful franchising model, already operating in several countries across Europe, and eliminate the ‘side by side’ model. This would be an important first step towards a return to waste collection directly by local authorities. This model would give power to local authorities to contract a single waste collection service for their area. The Council could insist on operating standards including affordable prices for householders and waiver schemes, and the company would be accountable to the local authority on whose behalf it is operating.

Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the Local Property Tax, which is a regressive, outdated tax that is not delivering the local services that people expect and deserve. Our councillors have helped to ensure that the tax is kept at the lowest possible level, especially given the pressure of the cost of living on workers and families. In government, we would abolish the LPT and instead deliver multi-annual, secure, and increased Exchequer funding for local authorities.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Pushing for increased social housing retrofitting to reduce bills for the most vulnerable households.

– Bringing waste collection services back under the control of local Councils. Increasing the provision of public waste services; such as bins and recycling centres. Reducing the Local Property Tax to the lowest possible amount in annual council budgets, until such time as it is abolished by a Sinn Féin government and is replaced by adequate, multi-annual funding from central government.

– Increasing the number of childcare spaces through the provision of more local authority led childcare facilities.

Safe Roads and Better Public Transport

Sinn Féin will ensure the delivery of safe roads and better public transport in local authorities.

Road safety and accessible transport are core proposals to ensure people can live and work safely in their communities. Green party Minister Eamon Ryan and his Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil government have consciously underfunded the budget for maintenance of local roads. The poor condition of our roads undoubtedly feeds into accidents.

2023 saw the highest number of deaths on our roads in almost a decade. Dublin has ranked worst, in public transport, of 30 European Cities in 2023 while large parts of rural Ireland are completely inaccessible by public transport. We also recognise that many children cannot safely access school without relying on a lift from parents.

As part of our plan to improve road safety, we must consider the roadworthiness of transport vehicles, and the education of drivers. In that regard, the waiting times for both NCT and NDLS appointments must be improved. Within one term of government, Sinn Féin will commit to hiring additional testers within both services to ensure a timely and effective access to car and driver testing.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

Delivering increased funding to ensure local roads are properly maintained.

Ensuring active travel teams are adequately staffed and properly resourced. Working with local communities to ensure footpaths and pedestrian infrastructure is fit for purpose.

Reviewing all active routes to schools in their area (existing and future) and develop improvement plans to be funded via the Department of Transport and National Development Plan and, where appropriate, to include requirements for significant future redevelopments to have designated bus collection and drop off points. Working to identify how underserved areas can be connected by public transport. Incorporating ‘Safe Routes to School’ into all Development Plans and Local Area Plans.

United Ireland

The Good Friday Agreement provides for referendums North and South on Irish Unity. Planning for these needs to begin now. We need a conversation on what kind of Ireland we want and how best to achieve it.

Partition has not served the people of Ireland. Sinn Féin is committed to an all-Ireland economy which builds upon existing cooperation and integration of services across the island, particularly in the areas of health, education, transport, agriculture and tourism.

All-Ireland planning for health will produce better outcomes. An all-Ireland education system will facilitate the sharing of resources and expertise, strengthen research and development and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the all-Ireland economy.

A united Ireland with a modern transport system will connect communities and move people, goods, and services across the island more efficiently. An all-Ireland agricultural sector will benefit rural Ireland and reduce the obstacles and red tape of working within two separate jurisdictions, and co-operation on environmental issues will assist in challenging the threat of climate change.

As a world-class tourist destination, a United Ireland will see all regions reach their full potential by creating employment and economic opportunity.

Local communities and local government have a key role to play in planning for Irish Unity, with Sinn Féin councillors working to establish Irish unity working groups in Councils and calling on the government to establish a Citizens’ Assembly on Irish unity. Proposals in support of these proposals have been passed in various Councils, such as South Dublin, Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan and Dublin, and other District Councils in the north.

Across the island of Ireland, the work of all Sinn Féin councillors is guided by the drive toward Irish Unity. Sinn Féin will promote co-operation across Councils, north and south, through enhancing existing cross-border agreements and relationships.

Sinn Féin will work to ensure that the benefits of cross-border funding are delivered for all communities. These include funding for the A5 North-West Transport Corridor, Casement Park, the Narrow Water Bridge connecting County Down to County Louth, hourly rail services between Belfast and Dublin, the Battle of the Boyne site in County Meath, Astronomical Observatories at Dunsink, Armagh and Birr and enterprise agencies’ co-operation schemes.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– The planning for, and promotion of, Irish Unity.

– Co-operation between local Councils, north and south, building on the work of existing cross-border, cross-council bodies and on Council initiatives such as those in County Donegal and Derry and Strabane District Council.

– Discussion on the harmonisation and integration of local government services across the island.

– Working to have the Irish government establish an all-island Citizens’ Assembly to discuss our constitutional future.

Making Local Government Work Better

A strong Sinn Féin team will fight for greater accountability in local Councils.

We currently have the most centralised system of local government in Europe with limited democratic decision-making powers and insufficient funding and resources for local authorities. This means that far too many decisions are made by unelected officials.

A Sinn Féin government would work to address this through a review of local government with a view to increasing powers and responsibilities of both elected Council and those who elect them.

We believe local authorities must be reformed. Accountability and transparency must be at the core of what they do. People must be able to access information, and we must work to remove any barriers that prevent this.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Tackling political exclusion by using D’hondt system, which is a fair and proportionate system to allocate committee chairs and membership of committee places.

– Increase transparency by mandating that all Council and Committee meetings be recorded and made available online.

– Reviewing the impact of Fine Gael and Labour’s decision to abolish town and borough councils with a view to supporting increased subsidiarity and accountability.

– Halting the privatisation of local Council services, while ensuring value for money for taxpayers.

– Exploring ways to increase the accessibility of Council meetings through subtitling or ISL interpretation.

– Reviewing localised budget processes to ensure that these are not used to plug gaps created by inadequate central government funding.

– Mandating the Chief Executive to publish an annual report detailing all motions passed in that year and an providing an update on their implementation.

– Exploring the potential to provide pooled staff resources for administrative work to all Councillors pending the full implementation of the Moorhead report.

– Establishing Local Authority Women’s fora.

Making Communities Accessible for People with Disabilities

1 in every 5 people have a disability of some form. We believe that supporting those with disabilities is about more than just paying lip-service.

In Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget 2024, we proposed that central government should support a Disabled Persons Organisations (DPO) Training and Development Fund and a Disability Inclusion Fund for all local Councils to support their specific disability inclusion requirements in line with the UNCRPD. In government, we would also increase funding for housing adaption grants.

Local authorities have a clear responsibility to create, maintain and support accessible spaces. Sinn Féin believe that when we create spaces that are accessible to our most vulnerable, they are accessible to everyone. This involves listening to disabled people and ensuring our community and public spaces do not place barriers in their way.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Recruiting a Disability Inclusion Officer in every local authority specifically to work to prevent decisions being made that create barriers for those with a disability. Ensuring all proposals for changes to public open spaces are reviewed through Universal Design Guidelines.

– Establishing a Voluntary Access Group, with people with disabilities as the core membership, in each local authority area.

– Utilising the NTA’s Walkability Audit when reviewing footpaths and routes for resurfacing and intervention.

– Drafting a Disability and Inclusion Strategy.

– Adapting existing homes and building new homes that are accessible.

Climate Action

Climate change and the challenge of reducing our carbon footprint to prevent further destruction of the planet must be a key consideration of decision makers in local government.

From returning vacant homes to use to making active travel a reality for people, a just transition is at the core of Sinn Féin’s proposals. We believe that supporting people to make environmentally sound decisions is the best way forward.

A Sinn Féin government would reform how retrofitting is funded, targeted, and delivered. Our policies would ensure that at least 75% of the funding for residential and community retrofits would be directed at those on low and modest incomes, so that achieving our climate targets go hand in hand with alleviating energy poverty and social deprivation.

We propose replacing the national retrofit programme with a new significantly different programme. We propose grants that are tiered so that the more help you need to afford a retrofit the more help you get. Our programme also includes area-based components to ensure more cost-effective and expedient delivery.

We propose a specific scheme for households relying on solid fuels - these are often cold, rural homes with the highest emissions; as well as the establishment of a dedicated fund for heat pumps given the urgent need to shift the fuel source of homes to renewable alternatives. In addition, Sinn Féin would prioritise and resource greater investment by local authorities in the retrofitting of their housing stock.

We believe that meanwhile use, which sees vacant commercial properties brought into temporary use, will help to end commercial vacancy.

In order to support real climate action Sinn Féin have proposed a dedicated public park and woodland fund, which would allow local authorities apply for funding to assist in the purchase or development of parcels of land for use as public parks and green areas.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Supporting the delivery and implementation of local climate action plans by ensuring all local authorities have designated Climate Action Officers and Coordinators.

– Protecting and enhancing biodiversity, expanding publicly owned and accessible green spaces and natural areas while contributing to carbon storage and sequestration.

– Mandating all local authorities with designated bathing areas to complete all year-round water quality testing Seeking to include district heating in new social housing developments where possible.

– Developing policies on ‘Meanwhile Use’ for all local authorities to help community groups and SMEs to understand the purpose, generate interest and afford developers greater confidence that they would get their site back.

– Prioritising coastal erosion and flooding prevention and management.

– Improving water quality.

Keeping Communities Safe

A strong Sinn Féin team will fight for more Gardaí – that are visible and on the beat.

The crisis in policing has seen attacks on Gardaí and unprecedented scenes of rioting and criminality in Dublin, with other cities also seeing significant and high-profile attacks.

Many suburban and rural communities feel badly let down by lack of Gardaí in their area, with Garda stations either closed entirely or operating severely reduced hours.

Across the State, anti-social behaviour is making communities feel at risk and businesses, workers and tourists have all expressed concerns about safety.

A Sinn Féin government would invest in a major Garda recruitment drive, along with introducing retention measures, to reduce resignations, and build Garda numbers. We would review the Community Safety Innovation Fund to ensure communities that are harmed most by criminality see proceeds of those crimes returned to them.

Sinn Féin also recognise the key role that fire fighters play in keeping our communities safe across the country; often at huge personal sacrifice to themselves.

Without urgent action to address the recruitment and retention crisis, the ability of these services to continue the work they do day in day is in doubt, putting lives at risk.

In government, we would provide capital funding to allow for the ongoing replacement of engines and other critical equipment, alongside the establishment of new stations where required.

All firefighters deserve financial security and peace of mind after years of service. Solving the recruitment and retention crisis within full-time and retained services which has worsened under this government will require all options to be examined.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Reviewing existing JPC structures and community safety fora to ensure these work with, and complement, proposed Local Community Safety Partnerships.

– Supporting local authorities through budgetary processes to ensure there are sufficient Tenant Enforcement Officers in place.

– Identifying areas for Dumping Taskforces to be established.

– Supporting the development of relationships between local community Gardaí and vulnerable communities.

– Ensuring the proper allocation of resources to ensure sufficient staffing for full-time and retained fire stations, enabling firefighters to perform their duties safely and efficiently while safeguarding our communities.

– Ensuring local authorities provide the technical assistance and equipment to map new and existing buildings to ensure speedy sharing of information and prevent a potential disaster in high-rise buildings.

– Ensuring local authorities provide all fire services with a mapping system of all fire hydrants and relevant high risk categorisation information across the State.
