## Irish General, Local, and European Parliament Election Manifestos

This repository contains publicly available party manifestos released prior to Irish General, Local and European Parliament Elections.

The folder [`data`](data) contains the entire text corpus in various file formats (`csv`, `parquet`, and `rds`). 

The folder [`manifestos_txt`](manifestos_txt) contains all manifestos as separate `txt` files. These files have been converted from the original PDF format and cleaned manually. 

You can access the text corpus through an interactive dashboard at: https://irishpoliticsdata.shinyapps.io/manifestoexplorer/

You are free to use data and results from the Manifesto Explorer in your research or in news articles as long as you mention the project and (if possible) add a link to this GitHub page or the interactive dashboard.
