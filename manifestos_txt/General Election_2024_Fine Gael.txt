Securing Your Future
Manifesto Introduction by An Taoiseach Simon Harris
It is the honour of my life to be Taoiseach of this great country.
Over the past seven months, I have travelled the length and breadth of this country and met thousands of you. We have discussed hundreds of issues and I have listened.
Your concerns have become my priorities.
Now I need a mandate from you to deliver for you and your family.
Over the past few weeks, I have worked with my team to ensure your issues are at the heart of this manifesto.
Fine Gael has prepared this plan based on four pillars to secure your future by:
• Giving our children the best start in life;
• Delivering homes and building better communities;
• Having a fair but firmer migration and criminal justice system;
• Protecting the economy and investing in your future.
Ireland is a great country. It has the potential to be even better.
We have a strong economy thanks to the hard work of the Irish people.
We have weathered multiple crises, from an economic crash and Brexit to the Covid-19 pandemic, a European conflict, rising migration, and a cost-of-living crisis. Ireland has endured because
the resilience of our people was matched with a resilient economy safeguarded by Fine Gael in Government.
Now, I want to see this economic success translate to real and tangible benefits for everyone in Ireland. It’s time to raise our ambitions, cut through bureaucracy, and bring a fresh energy to delivery that directly benefits our communities.
This Fine Gael manifesto is an honest commitment to ensure this country reaches its full potential by offering our people secure prosperity. No more boom and bust. No risking our economy for ideology. No more buck passing.
It is time to deliver for you and for your family.

Fine Gael has the plan to secure your future.


Ag Cinntiú do Thodhchaí
Réamhrá an Fhorógra ón Taoiseach Simon Harris
Is mór an onóir dom a bheith i mo Thaoiseach ar an tír bhreá seo.
Le seacht mí anuas, thaistil mé fud fad na tíre seo agus casadh na mílte daoibh orm. Phléamar na céadta saincheist agus d’éist mé libh.
Tá bhur gcuid ábhar imní mar thosaíochtaí agam anois.
Anois, tá sainordú ag teastáil uaim uaitse chun an beart a dhéanamh duit féin agus do do chlann.
Le cúpla seachtain anuas, d’oibrigh mé le m’fhoireann chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear do chuid ábhar imní ag croílár an tsainordaithe seo.
Tá an plean seo ullmhaithe ag Fine Gael bunaithe ar cheithre philéar chun do thodhchaí a chinntiú tríd an méid seo a leanas a dhéanamh:
• Cuidiú lenár bpáistí dul i gceann an tsaoil;
• Tithe a sholáthar agus pobail níos fearr a chothú;
• Córas cóir ach níos déine ó thaobh imirce agus dlí coiriúil a bheith ann;
• An geilleagar a chosaint agus infheistíocht a dhéanamh i do thodhchaí.
Is tír bhreá í Éire. D’fhéadfadh sí a bheith níos fearr fós.
Tá geilleagar láidir againn a bhuí le hobair chrua mhuintir na hÉireann.
Thángamar slán as go leor géarchéimeanna, ó thobchliseadh an gheilleagair agus an Breatimeacht go dtí paindéim COVID-19, coinbhleacht san Eoraip, ardú ar an imirce, agus géarchéim an chostais mhaireachtála. Sheas Éire an fód mar gheall go raibh athléimneacht ár bpobail ar aon dul le geilleagar seasmhach a chosain Fine Gael agus sinn sa Rialtas.
Anois, is mian liom an rath geilleagrach seo a aistriú go fíorthairbhí inláimhsithe do gach uile duine in Éirinn. Tá sé in am ár n-uaillmhianta a ardú, an maorlathas a shárú agus fuinneamh nua a thabhairt don seachadadh a rachaidh chun tairbhe dár bpobail.
Is ionann an sainordú seo ó Fhine Gael agus gealltanas macánta chun a chinntiú go mbaineann an tír seo barr a cumais amach trí rath seasmhach a chur ar fáil dár bpobal. Cuirtear deireadh le
borradh agus cliseadh. Ná cuirtear ár ngeilleagar i mbaol ar mhaithe le hidé-eolaíocht. Ná leagtar an fhreagracht ar dhream eile a thuilleadh.
Tá sé in am dúinn an beart a dhéanamh duit féin agus do do chlann.

Tá an plean ag Fine Gael chun do thodhchaí a chinntiú.







Giving our children the best start in life
The early years of a child’s life have a profound impact on who they become.The first five years are critical, shaping future health, education, and well-being. A happy, nurturing environment during these formative years can set a child up for lifelong success.
Fine Gael believes that every child deserves the best start in life, and supporting families in providing that start is central to our vision for Ireland’s future. This
is why childcare is a core focus for us. Affordable, accessible, and high-quality childcare is not just about giving children the best opportunities but also empowering parents, grandparents and carers to better balance the demands of modern life.


Better Early Childhood Education and Care
Every child deserves the best start, and every parent should have real choices to help balance work and childcare. While we’ve made childcare more affordable, too many families still struggle to find
accessible, affordable early learning nearby. Fine Gael has a plan to close this gap, working in partnership with existing providers,
We will: 
• Cap Childcare Costs: We’ll limit childcare costs to
€200 per month per child, or €600 for a family with more than 3 children.
• Expand Early Learning Places: We’ll create 30,000 new early learning places in public early learning and school aged care services by 2030, offering full- day and school-age care in areas of unmet need to close existing gaps and prepare for future demand. We will include an opt-in for private and community providers where appropriate.
• Extend Free Preschool Hours: The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme will provide an extra hour of free care each day in the second year of preschool.
• Increase Flexibility for ECCE Access: We’ll offer flexible options for parents of children who don’t qualify for the full two-year ECCE due to their date of birth.
• Make ECCE a Legal Entitlement: All eligible children will have a right to access the ECCE programme.
• Maximise School Facilities: We will enable schools to host before and after-school care and plan the development of State-led facilities in tandem with the school building programme.
• Include Childminders in the National Childcare Scheme: We’ll extend the scheme’s benefits to all childminders.
• Set Fair Wages for Childcare Educators: We’ll review and establish fair, progressive wages for childcare workers in public services and support pay increases across the sector to attract and retain talent.
• Improve Training Pathways: We’ll remove barriers in education and training for early years educators to


broaden access to the profession.
• Enhance Core Funding for Providers: We’ll review Core Funding to ensure it meets providers’ needs and reduce their administrative workload.
• Boost Access for Children with Disabilities and Disadvantaged Families: We’ll increase
participation in the Access and Inclusion Model and the Equal Start programme.
• Review Local Authority Provision: Review the 2001 Childcare Facilities Guidelines for Planning Authorities to ensure childcare spaces are provided and put into use.
• Consult and Plan for Immediate Action: We’ll start a broad consultation with families, educators, and providers, and within 100 days, release a detailed Action Plan to build an affordable, high-quality, accessible early childhood education and care system with State-led facilities to add capacity.
This plan is designed to work for everyone—families, early years educators, and providers—ensuring accessible, affordable, and high-quality childcare across Ireland.

Supporting Childminders as Part of Affordable Childcare
Fine Gael is committed to making childminding an affordable and viable choice for parents, even within a public early learning and school aged care system.
• Expand the Childcare Scheme: We will extend the National Childcare Scheme to cover childminders working in families’ homes, with sensible regulations that fit home-based care.
• Maintain Childminding Development Grants: We’ll continue funding grants that help childminders improve safety and quality through essential toys, equipment, and technology.
• Support Registration and Training: We’ll guide childminders through the registration process and expand access to local training opportunities.
Our approach will keep childminding affordable, accessible, and well-supported for families and childminders alike.


Acorn, a new Child Savings Account: Investing in Every Child’s Future


Fine Gael will launch an Acorn savings account for every child from birth, inspired by successful models in the UK. This fund will help families build a financial foundation for each child’s future, promoting a lifelong habit of saving and building a nest egg to meet future needs. Lower income families will benefit more from its inception
Fine Gael’s Acorn Savings Account will:
• Establish a Savings Account for Every Newborn: The government will establish a managed savings account for each child born each year, starting
with an initial contribution of €1,000, accruing via a managed fund at a conservative interest rate of 4% per annum, compounded yearly. Each child gets a gift only once, so the costs to the exchequer are contained. Each child from a family receiving child support payments gets €1500.
• Contain Costs Responsibly: The government will contribute €1,000 per child only once, keeping the programme affordable for the Exchequer.
• Enable Additional Family Savings: Parents can add up to €2,000 per year to their child’s account. With this regular contribution and the government’s initial €1,000, the account could reach €53,316 by the time the child turns 18.
This fund will help tackle inequality, support future generations, and promote a culture of saving, while empowering families to invest in a better, more secure future for their children.

Reducing Childhood Poverty: A Path to Brighter Futures
Child poverty is not inevitable. We need a determined focus to lift children out of poverty and give them
the futures they deserve. Fine Gael established the Child Poverty and Well-being Programme Office in the Department of An Taoiseach and we will reatan it to break down silos between departments and drive delivery.
Fine Gael will:
• Reduce Child Poverty Rates: We will set an ambitious child poverty target to ensure a focus on inequality and supporting families.
• Expand Hot School Meals: We will offer hot meals in all schools, so no child goes hungry.
• Provide Holiday Meal Support: We will ensure children have access to meals during school holidays.
• 
Examine a Second-Tier Child Benefit: We will explore a targeted child benefit payment, and the extent to which the Working Family Payment and Child Support Payment already help to reduce poverty.
• Extend Free Healthcare for u18s: We will provide free GP care for all children and young people under 18.
• Offer Free Travel to Children on Domiciliary Care Allowance: We will extend the Free Travel Pass to children with disabilities.
• Promote Uniform Swap Shops in Schools: We will encourage all primary schools to establish uniform swap shops to cut costs and support sustainability.

Fine Gael will ensure that children across Ireland have the resources and support they need to thrive and succeed.

Baby Bundles for Every Newborn
Fine Gael will give every newborn and their parents a Baby Bundle, providing essential items to support
them from day one. Each bundle will include blankets, nappies, a digital ear thermometer, clothes, and other necessities, along with a letter introducing the family to their new Acorn savings account, ensuring every child gets an equal start in life. Fine Gael is committed to making this support available to every new family.


Building a Stronger Child Health Workforce
Fine Gael is committed to making it easier for children with additional needs to access essential services by strengthening the child health workforce.
Fine Gael will:
• Boost Retention and Recruitment: Within 100 days undertake a consultation with all relevant


representative bodies to identify practical recruitment and retention initiatives, including sign up and retention payments for staff in child and adolescent mental health and children’s disability services to address acute needs and positively impact children’s futures. All public sector wage measures will be taken with regard to the current public service wage agreement.
• Double Therapy Programme Places: We’ll double college places in Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech and Language Therapy,
and engage with third level institutions to make assessed placements in special education and disability courses a key component in therapy and teacher training.
• Support Therapy Assistants: We’ll help therapy assistants qualify as therapists and encourage retired therapists to return, while increasing the number of Therapy Assistant positions through FETAC programmes to better support therapists.
• Create New Clinical Support Apprenticeships: We’ll develop apprenticeship programmes to fill critical clinical support roles.
• Access to Private Assessments: We will provide funding for private assessments of need for long waiting families and introduce a similar initiative to access therapies and mental health supports, while legislating for the National Treatment Purchase Fund to increase access in the longer term.
• Expand Public Health Nursing: We will increase Public Health Nurse numbers through a sponsorship scheme for nurses training in public health.
• Update the Disability Act: In collaboration with stakeholders and parents, we’ll review the 2005 Disability Act to improve service delivery, support the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and ensure we can deliver assessments of need in a timely way.
These actions will ensure that every child, regardless of their needs, can access the right care and support when they need it most.


Supporting Families: Accessible Resources, Tax Credits, Family-Friendly Policies, and Alternative Care
Fine Gael is committed to strengthening support


for families with accessible resources, financial relief, family-friendly policies, and a comprehensive approach to alternative care.

• Expand Family Resource Centres: We will increase the number of Family Resource Centres, while exploring ways to better support non-profit and social enterprise organisations.

to commencing the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act 2024 within the first 100 days, and enact without delay supplementary legislation. We will introduce leave for parents through surrogacy.
• Strengthen Breastfeeding Support: We will enhance support for breastfeeding with a
government-wide strategy, funding for community initiatives, more lactation consultants in hospitals and communities, and increased support for voluntary breastfeeding groups.
• Enhance Support for Foster Carers: Recognising the essential role of foster carers in our care system, we will implement a comprehensive action plan that takes a cross-government approach to foster care.
This plan will include:
• Increased Foster Care Allowance and increases in the new Initial Placement Payment.
• Exploration of pension provisions for foster carers to acknowledge their long-term commitment and ensure valued support after their fostering years.
• Recognise Kinship care: We will improve support for kinship care to enhance outcomes for kinship families.
These initiatives ensure that families, caregivers, and foster carers receive the recognition, support, and resources they need to thrive, strengthening our communities and enhancing the quality of life for all.

proceedings for the judiciary, lawyers and law enforcement officials, and consider the introduction of a specialised child justice court model.

Realigning the Department of Children, Equality, Disability and Youth
Fine Gael established the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2011. We will transfer the Migration and Integration functions back to the Department
of Justice so that children will be the focus of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability and Youth. This will also ensure a more joined-up approach to migration policy.
Fine Gael will also retain the Cabinet Committee on Children, Disability and Education, chaired by Simon Harris.

Delivering homes, building better communities
Fine Gael is dedicated to delivering homes and building vibrant, resilient communities across Ireland because we believe that every person deserves a secure and affordable place to live. Housing is at the heart of strong communities and economic growth, providing stability for families, young
people, and older citizens alike. We are committed to tackling housing shortages, reducing barriers to homeownership, and ensuring that rental options are fair and sustainable.
Our vision goes beyond just building houses. Fine Gael’s goal is to create communities that are well-connected, with accessible amenities like schools, healthcare, public transport, and green spaces. We aim to develop areas where people can thrive, feel secure, and connect with their neighbours.
To achieve this, Fine Gael is investing in infrastructure and reforming planning processes to speed up delivery. We are committed to helping first-time buyers, supporting affordable rental schemes, and enabling local authorities and developers to work together effectively. By effectively doubling housing delivery and prioritising sustainable development, Fine Gael will continue working to make Ireland a place where everyone can find a home in a community that supports a fulfilling, high-quality life.


Department of Infrastructure, Climate and Transport - Driving Progress, Efficiency, and Sustainability
Fine Gael recognises large-scale infrastructure projects are critical to Ireland’s economic growth and resilience; to delivering on our housing targets, and achieving our ambitious climate goals.
These vital projects face delays and escalating costs, arising from fragmented prioritisation, planning, and delivery, hampering Ireland’s ability to meet pressing infrastructure needs in energy, transport, water, and climate resilience like flood defences.
Fine Gael will establish a new, consolidated Department of Infrastructure, Climate and Transport to streamline and unify all aspects of infrastructure delivery, from planning to execution, under one dedicated leadership structure supported by relevant expertise within the Department.
This department will merge the Department of Transport and Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), and the infrastructure delivery functions of the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform (DPENDR) including the Office of Public Works.
Some functions may be transferred to other Departments. For example, the OPW’s National Monuments Service would move to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.
These changes will drive strategic alignment and efficient project delivery.
In addition to merging departments, we will also require agencies including Eirgrid, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and Uisce Éireann to report on their capital investment plans and delivery to the
Department of Infrastructure, Climate and Transport, ensuring clear reporting lines and accountability.
Agencies will retain their independence but this increased coordination will foster a more strategic approach, reducing inefficiencies and delays that arise from differing investment priorities and communication gaps.
The Minister for Infrastructure, Climate and Transport will oversee the delivery of the national development plan, manage all projects above €100 million or projects of regional significance are delivered on time, on budget, and aligned with national priorities. The


Minister will play a crucial role in project prioritisation and selection.
The Department of Public Expenditure will maintain its role in business case development, supported by a new Public Investment Act that places a revised
infrastructure code, reflecting Ireland’s climate needs, on a statutory footing. This Act will formalise Ireland’s infrastructure planning with a statutory infrastructure code focused on climate action and efficiency. This legislation will standardise and streamline project planning, integrating climate resilience into Ireland’s core infrastructure policies to create sustainable, value-driven outcomes
We will ensure relevant experts are brought directly into the Department to guarantee that large projects are completed on time and on budget.
To maximise efficiency in the delivery of projects, the Department will establish dedicated divisions including Transport, Energy and Communications, Water, Climate Resilience, Strategic Planning, and Digital Infrastructure. In additional to staff drawn from existing departments, a recruitment campaign will be undertaken to source and hire specialists in
project management, procurement and engineering, amongst other disciplines, ensuring a clear focus on timely and sustainable delivery.
The Department will enhance expertise in engineering, project management, and procurement while streamlining decision-making. This consolidation of accountability aims to significantly reduce inter-departmental and department-to- agency issues while increasing access to relevant expertise and improving overall project delivery.
The functions of the new Department will be to:
• Manage mega projects: For all strategic infrastructure projects and all capital projects above
€100 million, the state will establish a team reporting to a cabinet minister with day-to-day accountability and sufficient in-house expertise to manage all aspects of capital project delivery, from development and financing to design and evaluation.
• Strategically select projects: The new Department will function as an integrated body, balancing project selection, financing, and delivery mechanisms. It is not an allocative department but a comprehensive, centralised delivery mechanism for infrastructure projects of strategic importance. Planning legislation will remain with the Department of Housing.
• Speed up delivery: The new Department will speed up the delivery of key infrastructural elements


required by the state to enhance societal welfare and ensure Ireland meets its climate targets,
by applying and refining existing infrastructure guidelines into a new Public Investment Act.
• Accelerate Project Delivery: We will expand the Planning and Environment Court to ensure projects move forward without unnecessary setbacks.
This will enable housing and other high-priority infrastructure to meet sustainability criteria more effectively.
• Foster Local and National Collaboration: The Department of Infrastructure, Climate and
Transport will work closely with local authorities to ensure that national infrastructure projects meet local needs. Formal mechanisms will be developed to coordinate planning and implementation between the national department and local agencies, ensuring alignment with both community interests and Ireland’s broader infrastructural goals.
• Provide Supply Chain Certainty: Stable long term infrastructural investment, which Fine Gael in
government have already provided, will allow for a clear strategic direction and prioritisation of projects. This will provide industry with a line of sight on projects, lowering the risk for the supply chain to invest in capital and skills, which means firms can attract talent and supply chains become less fragmented.

Key Focus Areas and Divisions Within the Department
• Strategic Planning: This division will manage long- term planning, project selection, and coordination to align projects with Ireland’s economic and environmental goals.
• Transport: Responsible for integrating various transport modes, maintaining national planning frameworks for road, rail, aviation, and maritime systems.
• 
Energy and Communications: Focused on the development of renewable energy infrastructure, the energy grid, and broadband networks, supporting Ireland’s green transition.
• Climate Resilience and Adaptation: This division will oversee climate change adaptation in infrastructure, prioritising sustainable and resilient construction practices.
• Water and Environmental Infrastructure: In charge of water supply, wastewater management, flood prevention, and waste management projects.
• Urban Planning and Development: This division will handle sustainable urban development, housing infrastructure, and national spatial planning, excluding direct housing policy.
• Digital Infrastructure: Tasked with implementing smart city initiatives and ensuring cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.
• Investment and Development: This division will develop a pipeline of new projects, attracting both national and international bids for strategic infrastructure initiatives.

Reducing Bottlenecks and Enhancing Project Delivery
To maintain housing as a top priority, Fine Gael will establish a housing infrastructure division within the Department. This will support the Department of Housing to help fast-track housing projects,
particularly those meeting sustainability criteria, and reduce bureaucratic delays.
Additionally, collaboration with other government bodies will be prioritised to ensure that sectoral objectives are met without sacrificing overall strategic alignment.


Housing, Local Government and Heritage
Fine Gael has a strong record of rebuilding Ireland’s housing sector. We led the revival of homebuilding after the financial crisis, tripling housing output between 2011 and 2020 under the ‘Rebuilding Ireland’ initiative, and have continued this progress with ‘Housing for All’ since 2021.
But we know Ireland needs more homes, and we need them faster. Fine Gael is committed to delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030.
Through the National Planning Framework, we aim to balance growth by targeting 50% of new homes in the five major cities—Limerick, Galway, Waterford,
Cork, and Dublin—and 50% in the rest of the country. To achieve this, we’ll ensure there’s enough zoned, serviced land in the right places, speed up planning, and embrace modern construction methods to build more efficiently while growing the construction workforce.
To make housing delivery more transparent and accountable, Fine Gael will require local authorities to publish quarterly updates on their progress and report annually to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government, and Heritage.
Fine Gael will:
• Deliver 300,000 New Homes: We will build around 300,000 homes by 2030.
• Set New Ambitious Targets: We will introduce a new housing plan to follow ‘Housing for All,’ based on recommendations from the Housing
Commission and reflecting more ambitious targets.
• Invest Significantly in Housing: We will allocate
€40 billion to the housing budget over the next five years, averaging €8 billion annually, to ensure resources meet our ambitious housing goals.


Fine Gael is committed to building homes, supporting communities, and ensuring that every part of Ireland has the housing it needs to thrive.
The below table estimates our breakdown of housing output over the 2026-2030 period, based on a beefed-up National Development Plan to be agreed in 2025. Housing output for 2025 is an estimate based on Budget 2025, already agreed.


Helping People Buy a Home
Fine Gael is committed to making homeownership more accessible, especially for first-time buyers. Through key initiatives like the Help to Buy Scheme, affordable home schemes, and streamlining the home-buying process, we are dedicated to supporting
individuals and families in purchasing their own homes.

Help to Buy Scheme
Since Fine Gael introduced the Help to Buy Scheme in 2017, it has enabled 50,000 people and couples to buy their first homes by helping them secure a deposit.
Fine Gael will:
• Increase Relief for First-Time Buyers: Raise the relief under Help to Buy to €40,000, a 33% increase since the last adjustment in 2020.
• Extend the Scheme: Maintain the Help to Buy initiative until 2030.

Affordable Home Schemes
We are dedicated to making homes more affordable, with targeted schemes to support people on moderate incomes. We plan to build 9,000 affordable homes for purchase annually by 2030.
First Home Scheme
The First Home Scheme bridges the affordability gap by providing up to 30% of the home’s cost, with the government or banks taking a stake in the property.


Fine Gael will:
• Expand Eligibility: Extend the scheme to cover first-time buyers of second-hand homes.
• Extend the Scheme: Continue the scheme until 2030.

Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme
This scheme enables moderate-income buyers to purchase new homes at a reduced price, with local authorities holding an equity share.
Fine Gael will:
• Increase the geographic spread of Affordable Purchase schemes: Collaborate with local authorities to expand affordable purchase options in all counties.
• Rename and Promote the Scheme: Rebrand the Affordable Purchase Home Loan as the Starter Home Scheme to increase awareness and uptake.

Local Authority Home Loan
This government-backed mortgage helps first-time buyers who are credit-worthy but unable to secure traditional financing.


Fine Gael will:
• Adjust Loan Limits: Ensure the maximum loan values align with house price inflation, keeping the scheme accessible.


Making Home Purchases Quicker, Fairer, and More Transparent
Fine Gael recognises that buying a home can be time-consuming and frustrating. We are committed to reducing delays and improving transparency in the home-buying process.
Fine Gael will:
• Streamline the Purchase Process: Set a target of an 8-week turnaround from ‘sale agreed’ to handing over the keys, supported by e-conveyancing and
e-probate for faster processing.
• Enhance the Bidding Process: Establish an expert group to make the home bidding process clearer and more transparent, drawing on international best practices.
• Provide Resources for Buyers: Task the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission with creating


a step-by-step home-buying guide and establishing a dedicated portal for reporting bad practices.
• Fine Gael’s vision is to make homeownership a reality for more people across Ireland by increasing affordability, simplifying the process, and building strong support systems for first-time buyers.


Accelerating Housing Delivery
Fine Gael is dedicated to increasing the supply of homes, from identifying suitable land and streamlining planning to investing in construction methods and workforce growth. Our focus is on building sustainable communities, enabling homeownership, and providing homes that meet Ireland’s growing needs.

Land and Planning
Through the National Planning Framework, Fine Gael will promote balanced development, prioritising homes near public transport and local amenities.

• Streamline Planning: Implement the Planning and Development Act to make the planning process clearer, faster, and more predictable.
• Resource our planning authorities: Ensure An Coimisiún Pleanála and local authorities are adequately resourced with staff and financial resources to make decisions in a quick and predictable timeframe. .

Utilising Existing Buildings
Fine Gael will make better use of existing properties by:
• Supporting Conversions and Vacant Properties: Maintain the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, provide additional Vacant Home Officers, and make it easier for authorities to acquire vacant properties.
• 
Retaining the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant: We will maintain grants worth €50,000 (vacant) and €70,000 (derelict) for a further 5 years.
• Releasing cashflow for refurbishments: We will facilitate a mid-project phased payment equal to half of the vacancy grant to assist with cash flow on projects.
• Speed up applications: Ensure local authorities are appropriately staffed with Vacant Home Officers to administer the scheme efficiently.
• Expand the Living City Initiative: Expand the geographic areas covered under this scheme, which provides tax relief for money spent on refurbishing/ converting residential or commercial properties in Special Regeneration Areas (SRA) in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford.
• Promoting “Over the Shop” Living: Fund demonstration projects to showcase successful conversions and extend planning exemptions for commercial-to-residential conversions until 2030.
• Acquiring derelict sites: Make it easier for local authorities to CPO properties, using best practice for acquisitions via the Derelict Sites Act, as opposed to the Housing Act.

Enhancing our Water Infrastructure To support housing development,
Fine Gael will:
• Increase Investment in Water Infrastructure: Fully commit to Uisce Éireann’s capital investment programme to improve water and wastewater services.
• Fast-Track Water Connections: Set clear timelines for water connection agreements, ensuring large developments can proceed without delay. Establish a new procedure for large developments above 100 units where a developer can meet local authority planners and Irish Water on site to iron out issues at pre-planning stage.
• Expand Rural Water Schemes: Address wastewater needs in villages lacking access to public treatment facilities.

Empowering the Land Development Agency (LDA)
Fine Gael established the LDA to develop state- owned land for housing. Over the next five years,


 We will:

• Free Up State-Owned Sites: Intensify efforts to release state-owned sites with the potential to deliver up to 67,000 homes.

Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme
To kick-start apartment construction in Ireland’s five cities (Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford),
Fine Gael will:
• Activate Apartment Sites: Enable upfront payments to developers to fast-track the construction of apartment developments for owner-occupiers.

Supporting One-Off, Rural Housing
Fine Gael supports rural housing by:
• Taking a practical approach to one-off housing: We recognise the value of building thriving communities and family support structures, especially in rural Ireland.
• Continuing to support one-off self-builds: Through the Help to Buy Scheme, the First Home Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan.

Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)
Fine Gael will embrace new construction methods to make building faster and more sustainable.
We will:
• Lead by Example: Use MMC in public housing projects and expand modular housing options.
• Reduce Carbon Footprint: Collaborate with industry to lower embodied carbon in construction and adopt consistent procurement standards.
• Streamline regulatory standards: Standardise as much as possible the regulatory certifications required across our 31 local authorities.
We will commission an audit and propose recommendations within 100 days of government. We will request the NSAI to harmonise Ireland’s regulations with EU regulations insofar as possible to minimise paperwork and open up new market opportunities.
• 
Promoting timber: Update our regulatory system to promote the use of timber in new buildings and ensure that multi-storey timber frame residential units can be built.

Building a Skilled Construction Workforce
Fine Gael recognises the need for a larger construction workforce to meet housing goals.
We will:
• Grow Apprenticeships: Target 12,500 new apprentices annually by 2030, with two-thirds of them in craft/construction, and strengthen links between education providers and the sector..
• Boost Employment Permits: Increase permits for residential construction workers and actively recruit abroad through state agencies and embassies.

Financing the Housing Market
Fine Gael will increase private sector involvement in financing to reach €20 billion per year to provide for 60,000 homes by 2030.
We will:
• Introduce Cost Rental Backstops: Allow local authorities and the LDA to offer financial
guarantees to developers for affordable housing units, reducing financial risk.
• Attract New Private Investment: Develop new financing sources, especially for brownfield sites and small builders, with support from Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI).
• Keep development levy waivers under review: Incentivise the construction of new homes by keeping under review the time-limited arrangements for the waiving of local authority “Section 48” development contributions and the refunding of Uisce Éireann water and wastewater connection charges.
Fine Gael’s comprehensive approach will deliver more homes, make the housing market fairer, and build sustainable, thriving communities across Ireland.


Expanding Social Housing and Tackling Homelessness
Fine Gael is committed to increasing all types of housing – private, affordable, cost rental, and social – to meet Ireland’s growing needs. We have increased social housing from just over 1,000 homes per year in 2011 to more than 8,000 annually, the highest level since the 1970s. Our goal is to further expand social housing and ensure everyone has a stable, secure place to live.

Building Social Housing
Fine Gael will:
• Build 12,000 Social Homes per year: By 2030, we will construct 12,000 new social homes annually.

Social Housing Rents
Fine Gael will introduce a national differential rent scheme:
• Standardised Rent Reviews: Require local authorities to conduct annual rent reviews for a percentage of all tenants in social housing schemes, ensuring support goes to those who need it most.

Homelessness
Fine Gael is committed to increasing social housing supply, preventing homelessness, and ensuring Ireland’s housing system meets the needs of all citizens. We believe no one, especially children, should live in emergency accommodation long-term. We


will work to ensure that anyone entering emergency accommodation stays only briefly.
Fine Gael will:
• Focus on Preventing Homelessness: Prioritise securing private tenancies and other accommodation to prevent homelessness.
• Prioritise families: Focus social housing allocations on getting families out of long-term homelessness.

• Standardise Student-Specific Leases: Ensure student accommodation leases align with the academic year, making it easier for students to secure housing only for the months they need.
Fine Gael’s approach will make student accommodation more accessible, affordable, and tailored to the academic needs of students across Ireland.


Housing Adaptation Grants
Fine Gael understands the vital importance of the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for
Older People Grant. Last year, over 13,000 people benefitted from the grants.
Fine Gael will:
• Increase the value of Housing Adaptation Grants: Proceed with a 30% increase in the grant limits and a 25% increase in the income thresholds for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme.


Practical Housing Options for Positive Ageing
Fine Gael is committed to planning for positive ageing, helping people live independently in their own homes or providing the option to move to more suitable housing nearby. We recognise the shortage of purpose-built housing for older adults and are dedicated to expanding options for right-sizing.
Fine Gael will:
• Identify Dedicated Housing Sites: Mandate local authorities to find suitable sites for housing specifically designed for older adults, ensuring accessible options within local communities.
• Simplify Conversion Rules: Make it easier to convert houses into two flats, allowing older adults to continue living in familiar surroundings while adapting to changing needs.
• Review and Standardise the Older Persons Housing Financial Contribution Scheme: Examine the


possibility of a national system where local authorities offer smaller, manageable housing options to those who find their current homes too large.
• Explore Housing Trusts for Older Adult Communities: Consider creating Housing Trusts to develop and manage senior housing with on- site support services, fostering safe, supportive communities.
Fine Gael’s approach will empower older adults with the choice to remain in their communities, access right-sized homes, and live independently in a way that best suits their needs.


Addressing Legacy Issues in Housing
Fine Gael is committed to supporting homeowners affected by construction issues and improving building standards for future developments.
Fine Gael will:
• Review the Defective Concrete Blocks Scheme: We will conduct a comprehensive review of the Defective Concrete Blocks Scheme within six months, taking into account feedback from all stakeholders.
• Reinforce the Apartment Defects Scheme: Put this scheme on a statutory basis to provide support to owners of apartments with structural defects, ensuring assistance is accessible and reliable. We will support the ‘pathfinder’ approach to identify the most effective process for the funding of eligible works retrospectively.
• Create an Independent Building Standards Regulator: Set up an independent regulator to enforce high standards in construction quality and safety, preventing similar issues from arising in the future.
Fine Gael’s focus is on addressing past construction issues and building a safer, more reliable housing system for everyone in Ireland.


Improving Management for Apartment and Duplex Owners
Fine Gael is committed to supporting fair and efficient management for apartment and duplex owners, ensuring they have clear, effective governance of their communities.


Fine Gael will:
• Transfer Oversight to the Department of Housing: Move responsibility for the Multi-Unit Development Acts to the Department of Housing to streamline support for owners’ management companies and improve oversight.
• Conduct a Comprehensive Review: Complete an in-depth review within nine months to evaluate management practices, including considering a dedicated regulator for owners’ management companies to ensure effective governance.
Our aim is to enhance transparency, efficiency, and fairness in the management of apartments and duplexes, creating a better experience for residents and owners.


Supporting the Traveller Community
Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the Traveller community has access to safe and appropriate accommodation that meets their needs. With €23 million allocated for Traveller-specific housing in 2025, we will take action to improve access to housing and resources for Travellers across Ireland.
Fine Gael will:
• Ensure Local Authorities Utilise Budgets Fully: Require local authorities to deliver Traveller-specific housing and draw down their full budgets to maximise the impact of allocated funds.
• Strengthen Support Structures: Provide the necessary structures and resources to help local authorities deliver suitable and well-maintained accommodation for Travellers.
• Increase Funding for Site Infrastructure: Allocate additional capital funding to enhance infrastructure on Traveller accommodation sites, improving quality and accessibility.

Migration - A Fair but Firmer System
Migration is a good thing for Ireland. Thousands of people come to Ireland to work, to study and to fill essential skills deficits, and who make a significant contribution to our society.
We have ramped up processing of applications, introduced accelerated processing of certain countries, and significantly strengthened immigration enforcement. We will now introduce a new International Protection Act to provide for a firmer system, with stronger border security, faster processing of international protection (IP) applications and stricter measures to return unsuccessful IP applicants.
We will move away from the emergency use of hotels for housing asylum seekers and put in place facilities for those seeking protection on state land.
We cannot and should not lose sight of the benefits of migration. Our economy is built on being open: we need workers in all sectors like agriculture, in our multinational sector, in our health service and to build homes.
We will always help those in need and we cannot achieve that without rules-based systems that dismantle the criminal trafficking gangs.
Fine Gael will publish a National Migration and Integration Strategy detailing how we intend to meet the demands and the opportunities facing our society and economy over the next decade.


A Firmer System

Accommodation
Ireland has received an unprecedented number of International Protection applicants over the past few years. This is based on the fact that there are more people on the move globally than at any point since the end of World War 2.

delivery of increased public services, where possible.

These initiatives will establish a fairer and more sustainable accommodation system for asylum seekers while ensuring that local communities are supported and engaged in the process.

Legal and Necessary Migration
• Fine Gael is committed to addressing skill shortages and supporting economic growth through a strategic migration approach.

Effective Integration and Social Cohesion
Ireland needs migration to thrive, and Fine Gael is committed to ensuring successful integration so that newcomers feel welcomed and connected to our society.
We will:
• Publish a new national Migration and Integration Strategy: In the first year of government, we will


introduce a comprehensive strategy that reflects the significant increase in immigration and strong population growth over recent years.

• Support researchers and academics: By creating research fellowships and offering attractive residency terms in collaboration with Irish universities, we will strengthen Ireland’s appeal to top-tier academic and research talent.
• Engage the global Irish diaspora: We will establish talent networks to connect highly-skilled individuals abroad with opportunities in Ireland, creating a pipeline for skilled Irish emigrants to return and for foreign talent to engage with our economy.
• Increase the diversity of our workforce: Task the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF), comprising representatives from the Government, employers, and trade unions, with developing recommendations to enhance the diversity of our workforce, especially in the civil and public service sectors.
These initiatives will promote social cohesion and ensure that migrants are integrated into our society, contributing positively to Ireland’s future.

participation of people with disabilities, their friends, family and carers. We will ensure its implementation and its renewal when the time comes.

End the Welfare Trap by Introducing a New Working Age Payment
Fine Gael believes that work should always pay, and nobody should be better off on social welfare than in a job. The current Jobseeker’s Allowance scheme is an outdated means-tested system that pays a flat rate for each day of unemployment but restricts individuals who can only work part-time, disincentivising work and discouraging additional hours at a time when many small businesses are in need of staff.
Fine Gael will:
• Publish a strawman proposal for a Working Age Payment: Within our first 100 days in office, we will consult on a new Working Age Payment aimed at improving the welfare system.
• Create a stronger link between welfare and earnings: The Working Age Payment will ensure that individuals always see an increase in income when they take on additional work by removing
inconsistencies and anomalies in the current system.
• Base the Working Age Payment on the Working Family Payment model: This payment will incentivise and reward work, making it more
beneficial for individuals to engage in employment.
Fine Gael has a strong track record in introducing significant social policy reforms, such as the Pay Related Benefit and Auto Enrolment. We will apply the same collaborative approach, involving stakeholders in the final design of the new Working Age Payment.

Enterprise, Trade & Employment
Fine Gael will back businesses by providing more certainty and by reducing costs.
Businesses need a government that helps when it is needed and gets out of the way when it is not needed. The State must invest in the necessary infrastructure
for businesses to produce and sell their products and services globally.
With approximately 99% of businesses classified as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we recognise that many smaller businesses are under pressure.
These risk-takers are crucial for job creation across the country and are the lifeblood of our local economies.
We are committed to:
• Maintaining low, stable taxes: We will ensure that tax policies are predictable and conducive to business growth.
• Implementing clear and predictable regulations: We will ensure regulations align with the needs of both businesses and society.
• Applying the ‘SME test’: Over the next five years, we will require all parts of government to assess the impact of new regulations or laws on SMEs to avoid threatening viable businesses.
• Prioritising balanced regional development: We will focus on job creation in rural areas as a key component of our enterprise policy.
• Fostering entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship: We will support initiatives that encourage innovation and the growth of indigenous companies.
• Supporting the multinational and indigenous exporting sector: We will work to enhance the


contributions of indigenous exporting firms and multinational companies to our economy.
• Promoting green and digital transformation: We will assist businesses in adopting sustainable practices and digital technologies.
Since Fine Gael entered government in 2011, nearly 900,000 more people are now at work, representing a 47% increase. We are committed to maintaining full employment, creating an extra 300,000 jobs and ensuring that both workers and companies benefit from economic growth.


Three-Point Package for Business
Fine Gael will enhance cash flow for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through a targeted three-point package:
1. Temporary PRSI Rebate: We will introduce a temporary, three-year PRSI rebate based on the number of lower-earning workers on a company’s payroll. This will provide a €12.75 flat subsidy for all workers earning below
€592 per week.
2. Lower VAT Rate: We will permanently reduce the VAT rate from 13.5% to 11% for food and catering services, as well as all entertainment, hairdressing and beautician services, to support consumer spending and business viability. We will also introduce a tax credit for gym membership worth €50.
3. Energy Cost Grant Scheme: We will establish a new grant scheme to help businesses lower their energy costs, enabling them to operate more sustainably.
Electricity and gas are currently on a temporary 9% rate which is due to expire at the end of April and revert to 13.5%. Under our proposal electricity and gas will not revert to 13.5% but instead will go to 11%. This will have no negative impact on the vast majority of Irish businesses because they can claim back all of the VAT on utility bills.
As we abolish the 9% VAT rate, most other items in this category will either go to zero or be compensated for. Our plans include a tax credit for leisure club membership worth €50 and we’ll allow employers to offer to contribute €50 tax free towards leisure club membership for their staff.
In a further measure, households will receive a Domestic Energy VAT Rebate of €40 per annum to


insulate them from any additional costs arising from our simplification of the VAT system.
In addition to this three-point package,
we will:
• Apply the SME Test: We will scrutinise every new piece of legislation and regulation for its impact on SMEs, ensuring that any obligations that increase business costs are phased in and consider the broader implications across government.
• Review Existing Regulations: We will undertake a look-back exercise to identify redundant regulations and reduce unnecessary red tape, asking each government department and regulatory agency to submit a list of such regulations.
• Minimise Compliance Costs: We will restrict reporting requirements to essential data only, providing digital tools for compliance to ease the burden on businesses.
• Phase in New Requirements: We will ensure that new requirements from government are
implemented in a considered and planned manner.
• Support Access to Grants: We will help businesses access available grants to digitise operations and enhance sustainability.
• Ensure a Skilled Labour Force: We will provide practical support for on-the-job training and apprenticeship schemes to meet industry needs.
• Backfill Grants for Staff Training: We will support SMEs in providing training for their staff by offering grants to cover loss of earnings during training.
• Financial Assistance for Apprenticeships: We will reduce the costs associated with taking on
apprentices and provide financial aid for businesses investing in employee upskilling and reskilling.
• Resource Local Enterprise Offices: We will ensure that Local Enterprise Offices are equipped to profile the SME landscape in their areas and meet industry- specific needs. Additionally, we will adjust Enterprise Ireland’s mandate to better support both indigenous exporters and enhance its funding model.
These initiatives aim to strengthen the business environment in Ireland, ensuring that SMEs can thrive and contribute to the economy.

• Explore extending the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant: We will assess the feasibility of allowing businesses to convert upper-level spaces into residential accommodation, enabling multiple applications for different premises.
• Modernise licensing laws: We will enact legislation to update our licensing laws, promoting the development of a modern and diverse night-time economy in harmony with increased town centre living.
These initiatives are aimed at revitalising the hospitality and retail sectors, ensuring they remain vibrant and resilient in the face of challenges.


300,000 Extra Jobs
Fine Gael’s ambition is to create the conditions necessary to add 300,000 jobs by 2030, surpassing the milestone of 3 million people in employment. We recognise that achieving this goal will require strategic investments, supportive policies, and a focus on fostering a vibrant economy.
To reach this target,


we will:
• Promote business growth: Implement initiatives that support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to expand and create new jobs.

By focusing on these key areas, Fine Gael aims to build a strong economy that not only meets the needs of today but also secures a prosperous future for all citizens.


Supporting Workers
Workers are the backbone of successful businesses and organisations. Addressing the needs of workers— such as fair pay, education and upskilling opportunities, and recognition for their contributions—is essential for any thriving enterprise.
Fine Gael will:
• Support the Low Pay Commission: We will ensure that its recommendations are compatible with the SME Test, balancing fair wages with the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises.

• Publish an Action Plan for collective bargaining in 2025: If necessary, we will bring forward legislation to support this initiative.
These commitments aim to create a supportive environment for workers, enhancing their rights and welfare while fostering a productive and engaged workforce.


Competitiveness
Fine Gael is committed to enhancing Ireland’s competitiveness across various sectors. We will develop and publish an Action Plan for
Competitiveness, which will integrate wage policy, tax policy, education and training, energy and utility policy, and digitisation. Our goal is to make Ireland the most promising environment for startups, the
most supportive environment for existing indigenous industries, and the most attractive location for foreign investment in value-added services, high-tech, and pharmaceuticals.
Fine Gael will:
• Review business grants and tax incentives: We will ensure that the services sector has access to the same types of government supports currently available to the manufacturing and retail sectors.

• Establish new reporting lines for LEOs and County Councils: This initiative will ensure equal access to business supports nationwide. Enhanced reporting will help develop better services and grants while phasing out obsolete or redundant programs. A new steering group within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will oversee the implementation, accessibility,
and uptake of grants and general LEO policy, with ministerial involvement.
• Create a forum for social entrepreneurs: We will establish a forum that includes social entrepreneurs, the Department of Rural and
Community Development, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This will promote a more integrated approach to social entrepreneurship and build on Ireland’s first National Social Enterprise Policy.
These initiatives aim to empower social enterprises, ensuring they have the necessary resources and support to thrive and contribute positively to communities across Ireland.


Supporting Ireland’s Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups
Fine Gael is committed to fostering a vibrant environment for entrepreneurs and start-ups, recognising their critical role in driving innovation and economic growth.


Fine Gael will:
• Create a national start-up campus: This facility will serve as a central hub for entrepreneurs to engage with all government departments and agencies,
fast-track the start-up process, and collaborate with fellow entrepreneurs. The concept will draw inspiration from successful models like Station F in Paris and will be supported nationwide through Smart Regions funding.
• Establish a unitised private venture fund: We will create an investment vehicle that companies can apply to for scale funding, enabling them to grow and thrive.
• Encourage venture capital investment: We will explore ways to incentivise venture capitalists to invest in companies with significant Irish ownership by offering favourable tax treatment in line with state aid rules. This aims to attract more capital into Irish scaling companies, particularly from US and
UK funds, positioning Ireland as a prime location for venture capital investment.
• Develop an all-island innovation ecosystem: Leveraging the Shared Island Fund, we will invest in initiatives that bridge Northern Ireland and
the Republic of Ireland. This will involve creating a unified network of innovation hubs, targeted entrepreneurial programs, and continuous AI

These initiatives aim to create a dynamic ecosystem for entrepreneurs and start-ups, ensuring they have the necessary resources and support to succeed.

A Competitive Europe for the Future
Europe is at a critical economic crossroads. As we fall behind our international peers in competitiveness and innovation, our citizens risk suffering the consequences. Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that Ireland shapes the EU’s response to these challenges in a manner that benefits both European
and Irish citizens, adhering to our principles of free and open trade, a level playing field, multilateralism, and a rules-based order.

An Ambitious and Fair EU Economic Policy
In light of increased subsidies in the US and China, there is growing momentum in parts of Europe towards subsidising certain industries, which could undermine the level playing field of the Single Market and create disparities among member states. Fair competition is a core principle of EU membership, and strategic autonomy should not equate to increased tariffs, subsidies, or protectionism. While the State can stimulate investment and growth, true innovation should remain in the hands of our entrepreneurs, researchers, and inventors.


Fine Gael will:
• Promote an open, multilateral, rules-based trade system: We will advocate for free trade policies that support economic growth.
• Push for an ambitious and open EU trade agenda: Our goal is to expand opportunities for Irish businesses in international markets.
• Work with like-minded countries: We will safeguard the principles of EU economic policy based on competitiveness, innovation, and a level playing field.
• Promote new Free Trade Agreements: Our economy is based on the ability to trade internationally. We will ensure these agreements include proper assurances regarding sustainability, human rights and the protection of our agricultural sector.
• Deepen the EU Single Market: We will work to create a genuine digital single market and launch a Competitiveness Strategy for Europe to invigorate entrepreneurship.
• Reduce red tape for businesses and SMEs: We will strive to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy in EU Directives and Regulations to facilitate business operations.
These initiatives aim to enhance Ireland’s trade landscape, ensuring that our interests are safeguarded while contributing to a fair and equitable global trading system.


Protecting Consumers
As the cost of living continues to rise, protecting consumers is more crucial than ever. Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that our laws remain current and that unfair practices are eliminated.
Fine Gael will:
• Empower the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission: We will enhance the powers of the Commission to better protect consumers and clarify the Central Bank’s role in consumer protection. An independent review, led by an international expert, will be commissioned to assess how State bodies can improve consumer protection, focusing on the roles of the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.
• Reform the small claims court: We will improve the small claims court system to ensure it provides a viable and cost-effective means for consumers to resolve disputes with businesses.
• 
Address ticket pricing issues: We will explore options to address recent consumer dissatisfaction regarding ticket pricing for cultural and sporting events, based on an ongoing examination by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). Current laws mandate that traders must act in good faith and not mislead consumers.
• Review the Sale of Tickets Act 2021: We will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this legislation to determine its effectiveness four years after its implementation.
• Update regulations for online influencers: We will ensure that legislation and guidelines regarding the disclosure of commercial content by online influencers are current and effective.
• Combat misleading online retailers: We will examine measures to prevent websites, especially online retailers, from misrepresenting themselves as Irish or EU companies through .ie domain names. This misrepresentation can result in consumers facing additional taxes and charges, as well as lacking access to EU and Irish consumer law protections. We will collaborate with the CCPC to raise awareness of this issue.
• Promote consumer rights for online purchases: We will raise awareness of new laws that grant consumers the same rights for goods and services purchased online as they have for in-store purchases.
• Increase transparency in pricing: We will inform consumers about new laws that require advertised price reductions to include the previous price of the product, ensuring that the product was available at that earlier price during the preceding 30 days.
These initiatives aim to enhance consumer protection and ensure that consumers are informed, safeguarded, and treated fairly in the marketplace.


Finance, Taxation, and Economic Security
Fine Gael is dedicated to managing public finances responsibly and equitably for taxpayers. We have consistently reduced income tax over the last decade. Our commitment remains to lower the tax burden on working families and to ensure that our tax system is progressive, incentivising work and allowing individuals to retain more of their hard-earned income.
Fine Gael will:
• Continue to prioritise making work pay in taxation measures: This commitment will ensure that significant resources are directed toward reducing taxes and enhancing financial relief for families.
• Commit to progressive budgets: We will ensure that our budgeting approach throughout the government’s term remains progressive, reflecting our commitment to fairness and support for working families.


Rewarding Work
Fine Gael recognises the important role taxation plays in fuelling our society, boosting our economy and deciding people’s standard of living.
We will be guided by three key principles:
• Everyone should make a contribution.
• Those who can contribute the most should contribute the most.
• Those on the average wage should not pay at the higher rate.
Fine Gael will:
• Increase the higher tax band threshold: We will raise the point at which a worker enters the higher tax band by at least €2,000 each year, ensuring that individuals earning €54,000 will not be subject to the higher rate of income tax.
• Boost main tax credits: We will increase the Personal, Employee, and Earned Income Credits by
€75 annually. This will translate to €750 back in the


pocket of most taxpayers by 2030.
We will also aim to increase the proportion of future income tax measures within overall budgetary spending, reinforcing our commitment to a fair tax system that rewards work.

Universal Social Charge
Fine Gael is committed to reducing the burden of the Universal Social Charge (USC) to ensure a fairer tax system for all.
Fine Gael will:
• Adjust USC thresholds: We will raise the entry threshold for the 3% USC band from €27,382 to
€40,000, and the entry threshold for the 8% USC band from €70,044 to €75,000.

Equal Treatment for the Self- Employed
Recognising the importance of entrepreneurship, Fine Gael believes that self-employed individuals should not face undue penalties.
Fine Gael will:
• Abolish the USC surcharge on self-employed income: This measure will help support those who take risks to build their businesses.
• Ensure the self-employed benefit from tax credits: We will align any increases in personal income tax credits to ensure self-employed individuals receive the same benefits as employees.


Benefit in Kind
Fine Gael will enhance the use of non-cash payments for employees.
Fine Gael will:
• Enhance Benefit in Kind: We will compile recommendations to promote Benefit in Kind as a method for supporting health and wellbeing
activities, such as gym memberships or dental care.

Inheritance Tax
(Capital Acquisitions Tax)
Fine Gael acknowledges the principle of inheritance tax but recognises that the burden of capital taxation has increased significantly over the past 15 years.


Ireland already generates above-average revenue from inheritance and gift taxes, and recent fiscal drag has further cut the thresholds in real terms.
Fine Gael will:
• Increase Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds: We will raise the Group A threshold (for children) to €500,000, Group B (for siblings) to €75,000, and Group C (for others) to €50,000, building on the progress made in Budget 2025.

Medium-Term Fiscal and Structural Plan
Fine Gael will:
• Publish a Medium-Term Fiscal and Structural Plan: We will maintain a responsible approach to the public finances while ensuring continued investment in essential services and capital infrastructure such as housing, schools, and hospitals.
• Spending Rule: Our proposed current expenditure adheres to the spending rule of 5%. Capital expenditure will increase by 11%. This will be funded by the addition of funding from the recent decision of the General Court of the European Union to existing capital plans.


National Development Plan
Fine Gael is committed to unprecedented levels of capital expenditure to advance vital infrastructure projects.
Fine Gael will:
• Inject €100 billion in capital projects: We will increase capital spending by 11% per year, in recognition of the crucial infrastructural investment needed in housing, water, energy and other areas. Boosted by the receipts from the Apple judgement, this will represent by far the highest annual expenditure on capital projects in Ireland’s history.
• Refresh the National Development Plan: Within the first year, we will reassess National Development Plan allocations based on the updated National Planning Framework and future housing and population demands.
• Ensure the new Department of Infrastructure, Climate and Transport delivers outcomes: We will


oversee this record spending to ensure it represents value for money and meets public needs.


Windfall from Apple Tax Judgment
Fine Gael will utilise the Apple tax windfall to address critical infrastructure needs, allocating over half of the proceeds to housing.
We will prioritise funding for:
• Housing and the Land Development Agency: This will accelerate housing delivery.
• Water and sanitation: Ensuring access to clean water and effective sanitation systems.
• Energy grid improvements: Focusing on transmission and renewable energy integration.
• Transport and road infrastructure: Through Transport Infrastructure Ireland to enhance connectivity.
We will outline a plan for the allocation of these funds within 100 days of taking office.


Future Ireland Fund and Infrastructure, Climate, and Nature Fund
Fine Gael established the Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund to protect public services over the long term and mitigate the pro-cyclicality of capital spending.
Fine Gael will:
• Transfer 0.8% of GDP to the Future Ireland Fund annually: This translates to approximately €4-5 billion each year, with the fund potentially growing to
€100 billion by 2040.
• Allocate €2 billion each year to the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund: This fund will focus on initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve water quality, and enhance biodiversity.


Insurance
Fine Gael has implemented a range of reforms to lower costs and improve the availability of insurance. While progress has been made, particularly with motor


premiums decreasing by around a third since their peak, further reductions are needed, especially for businesses. Encouraging competition and expanding coverage are key priorities.

Funds and Asset Management sector

in recent years, the recent review of the sector published by the Department of Finance highlights the importance of adapting our offering.
Fine Gael will 
• Help grow the Funds and Asset Management sector: We will act on the recommendations of


the recent Department of Finance report on the funds and asset management sector, including streamlining our tax and regulatory framework.


Financial Literacy
Fine Gael is committed to enhancing financial literacy among the population, empowering individuals to manage their finances effectively and make informed decisions.
Fine Gael will:
• Promote financial literacy for better financial management: We will help people understand how to manage their finances, plan for retirement, and navigate the online financial landscape, recognising both the benefits of saving and investing and the risks, including online fraud.
• Fund and implement a National Financial Literacy Strategy: This coherent strategy will aim to equip individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to improve their financial wellbeing.


Tackling Fraud
As more services move online, the potential for fraudulent activity is increasing. Fine Gael is
committed to ensuring that the political and legislative systems keep pace with these challenges.
Fine Gael will:
• Enhance efforts through the Nuisance Communication Industry Forum (NCIF): We will build on existing initiatives to combat the growing issue of scam calls and texts.
• Explore an SMS scam filter: We will examine the feasibility of implementing a filter that functions like email spam filters to help reduce scam messages.

Capital Markets Union
Fine Gael recognises the need for significant investments to support the green and digital transitions and address the challenges of an aging population. To facilitate this, we must remove barriers to the free flow of capital in the Single Market and create a more efficient system for businesses, investors, and savers.
Fine Gael will:
• Advance the Capital Markets Union (CMU): We will actively promote and implement the CMU to enhance investment opportunities across Europe.


• Maintain strong relations with capital markets in London: We will leverage the EU-UK forum to foster discussions on financial services and ensure continued collaboration.

Acompetitivebankingsectoriscrucialtothefunctioning  of our economy and society. Irish consumers currently lack access to some financial products, including loans from European banks. Completing the Banking Union will enhance competition and provide greater choice for Irish businesses and consumers.

Corporation Tax
Ireland’s corporate tax regime is essential for attracting foreign direct investment, and Fine Gael is dedicated to defending it vigorously. While we are committed to the OECD global framework for corporate tax, we will uphold our tax sovereignty.
Fine Gael will:
• Defend Ireland’s Corporate Tax regime: We will strongly protect our corporate tax framework from attempts at harmonisation or indirect changes.
• Ensure Irish tax policy remains sovereign: We will insist that tax policy continues to be determined in Ireland, safeguarding our unique tax landscape.


Public Expenditure & Reform
Ireland is at a crucial juncture. With a rapidly growing population and a strong economy, we face significant challenges in key areas such as housing, infrastructure, and access to public services. This moment presents
a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fundamentally transform how we plan for our future economic needs and how the State delivers infrastructure and essential public services. We aim to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and our renewable energy resources while maintaining a constant focus on delivering
value for money. This is vital for retaining our competitiveness in a fast-changing world.

Planning Unit for the Future
• Establish a new Planning Unit for the Future:
This unit will be separate from but report to the Department of An Taoiseach. Its primary responsibility will be to produce regular
forecasts and updates on crucial factors such as population growth, immigration trends, changing demographics, and the demand for essential services and employment. This unit will ensure that our planning forecasts are credible and based on reliable data, rather than conservative estimates.

Reforming Public Services
• Transform our public services: Fine Gael will initiate reforms in our public services through a four- part approach:
• Reducing costs: We will work to lower the cost of services for users and for the State itself.
• Widening access: We will ensure that everyone who needs access to services can obtain it easily, including through enhanced digital platforms.
• Expanding services: We will roll out additional services to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population.
• Redesigning services: We will apply the latest technologies and encourage joined-up thinking


to guarantee high-quality service delivery, maximising the potential benefits of AI.

Ensuring Access to Public Services for All
• Improve access to a range of public services: Fine Gael will further develop a “one-stop-shop” approach, allowing people to access a host of public services easily, whether online or in person. We will continue
to integrate digital services across government departments and establish a single digital unit to enhance the delivery of public services online.

Improving Public Procurement
• Review and enhance the government procurement process: We will conduct a thorough review to make the procurement process more transparent, accountable, and participative, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ireland. This includes ensuring a consistent approach across all state agencies and departments, implementing a purchasing code
of practice, and driving sustainable procurement policies that support local businesses. We will also increase the adoption of new technologies in the procurement process and provide an expected timeframe for decisions on tender requests.

Value for Money in State Spending
• Commit to ensuring value for money in public spending: It is essential that taxpayers receive good value for their contributions. This focus on value
for money is even more critical now, especially with record public finances and surpluses. While many projects are completed on time and within budget, we must intensify our efforts to ensure larger projects are similarly managed effectively.
• Ensure sign-off on significant projects: We will ensure that any publicly funded project by the Office of Public Works (OPW) costing over €200,000 receives approval at the management board level.
• Strengthen the Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board: We will bolster this Board which oversees major infrastructure projects, and introduce independent value-for-money audits on key projects to identify efficiencies and best practices for future investments.
• Expand public engagement on large-scale


projects: This will enhance transparency and build public trust in how funds are allocated.

Budgetary Reform
• Revamp the budgetary process: Fine Gael will introduce a more open and inclusive budgetary process, moving away from the traditional focus on maintaining existing levels of service. Instead, the budget will concentrate on achieving significant public goals and demonstrating proven policy performance. We will continue to evolve the budgetary process to ensure that it aligns with our national well-being, equality, and climate objectives. Additionally, we will explore competitive budget pots that focus on key areas of strategic importance, such as tackling disadvantage and promoting digitalisation. Ministers will be required to bid for funding based on the expected impact of their proposals.

Staffing a Public Sector for the Future
• Support the recruitment and development of public sector talent: We recognise the critical role that public sector workers play in delivering essential services. Successive public pay agreements have acknowledged their contributions and promoted stability in industrial relations. Fine Gael will encourage recruitment practices within the civil and public service that foster talent development by:
• Collaborating with public service organisations to create structures for talent development and
actively recruiting from outside the traditional pool.
• Continuing to develop an apprenticeship model within the civil service to attract and nurture talent.
• Offering a paid internship programme targeted at migrant communities and individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds to provide them with valuable experience in government departments.
• Negotiating a new public sector pay deal, linked to a reform agenda, to succeed the existing deal.
• Promote new ways of working: We will encourage flexible working arrangements to enhance workplace participation, support work-life balance, and facilitate the delivery of improved public services seven days a week when necessary. Fine Gael will review the Civil Service Blended Working Policy Framework and consider how the public sector can adopt a coherent approach to blended working and remote work.
• Invest in skills development: To ensure a digitally enabled workforce, we will invest in upskilling public sector workers, equipping them with the tools


to apply digital skills to enhance service delivery, particularly in areas such as data utilisation, AI integration, and user-centric design.

Artificial Intelligence in the Public Service
• Enhance the use of AI in public service delivery: Fine Gael recognises the opportunities that artificial intelligence presents to improve the delivery of public services. We will accelerate the adoption of AI across the public service to create a trusted, human-driven, intuitive, and inclusive
digital government service. This includes publishing updated guidelines for the use of AI in the public sector and rolling out pilot programmes to demonstrate its application and benefits.

Political Reform
• Reform the Ethics in Public Office Legislation: Fine Gael will overhaul this legislation within the first year of the new government. This overhaul will introduce new prohibitions on the use of insider information, enhance disclosure requirements to improve transparency, and strengthen the role of the Standards in Public Office (SIPO) in enforcing these standards.
• Expand the remit of the Public Accounts Committee: We will extend the committee’s oversight to include local authorities to ensure accountability for their delivery on key areas, such as housing and local property tax.
• Review local government reforms: Fine Gael will undertake a comprehensive review of the “Putting People First” reforms initiated in 2012, informed by public consultation. This will include evaluating the National Oversight and Audit Commission, the
independent body for the local government sector, ten years after its establishment.
• Support local government reform: We will adequately resource the newly elected mayoral role in Limerick to drive the published mayoral programme and fully leverage the new governance structures for streamlined decision-making. Furthermore, we will support plebiscites for directly elected mayors in other cities, including Dublin.
• Modernise electoral registration: Fine Gael will work with An Coimisiún Toghcháin/The Electoral Commission to update and improve the electoral registration process, making it more efficient and accessible for citizens.
