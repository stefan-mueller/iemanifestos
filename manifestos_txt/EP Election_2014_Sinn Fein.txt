Our record in the european parliament
In 2009 bairbre de brún was elected to the european parliament by the people of the six counties. She was replaced by former stormont junior minister martina anderson mla in 2012.

During the last five years bairbre and martina have sought not just to represent the people who voted for them, but the interests of ireland as a whole.

During her time as an mep, bairbre de brún:
• represented the european parliament at the annual united nations climate change talks in cancun.
• acted as an international observer to the palestinian elections in 2006 and visited gaza twice as part of a delegation of european parliamentarians.
• authored a parliamentary report evaluating the effects of the peace ii programme in ireland which was the first parliamentary report to be published in irish.
• authored the parliament’s report on animal transportation to prevent the spread of rabies
• was instrumental in achieving status for an ghaeilge as an official language of the european parliament.
• hosted an all-ireland delegation dealing with ‘families bereaved through suicide’.
• co-hosted with mary lou mcdonald td a delegation led by trade unionists and bereaved families focusing on health and safety in the workplace

During her time as mep, martina anderson:
• has been a spokesperson on the tobacco products directive and campaigned for stricter regulation of the tobacco industry and in particular their targeting of younger people through advertising and products aimed at young people.
• authored a report on the implementation of the eu youth strategy.
• hosted an international inquiry into irish unity in brussels which considered the role the eu could play in the reunification of ireland.
• hosted a wide range of organisations in brussels including; older peoples’ delegation; ictu lgbt group; a farmer delegation with martin ferris td; comhaltas ceoltóiri éireann and derry fleadh cheoil committee, chambers of commerce and business organisations from across the north; the victims of state collusion and violence, and sporting bodies representing gaa, soccer, rugby.

Martina was also one of the only irish meps to actively oppose the cuts to the eu budget arguing for increased investment in programmes to create jobs, tackle youth unemployment, and to invest in deprived urban and rural communities

1. Introduction

Eu in ireland’s crisis

The economic and social crisis that has engulfed the north and south of ireland since 2008 was caused by both domestic and european factors. The irish and british governments and key eu institutions including the european commission and european central bank all share responsibility.

While the north may have been sheltered from the worst excesses of the banking and currency crisis it has not been immune from the fallout as two of the four major banks in the north are southern based.

Austerity imposed by westminster and actively supported by the european union has had a significant impact on the local economy and on communities. The northern economy has contracted more than most areas in the eurozone and britain since 2008.
Irish people were the victims of bad government in dublin and london, bad irish and european banks and bad decisions in brussels and frankfurt. Nowhere is this more evident than in the issue of debt.

As the banking crisis unfolded in 2008 the fianna fáil-led government acquiesced to pressure from the european central bank governor jean claude trichet to bail out the banks, irrespective of the social and economic cost. The official policy in dublin and frankfurt was that no bondholder was to be burnt.

Fianna fáil and the green party protected the bondholders because many of them were part of the infamous golden circle. Bertie ahern and brian cowen stood by their friends in anglo irish bank.

The blanket banking guarantee of october 2008, the nationalisation of anglo irish bank in 2009, the €30 billion anglo irish bank promissory note and the €30 billion cost of recapitalisation of the bank of ireland and allied irish bank all flowed from this.

Despite opposing this policy when in opposition, once in government fine gael and labour continued to implement fianna fáil and ecb policy – pouring €17 billion of taxpayers’ money into aib and the bank of ireland, saddling future generations with the promissory note debt and extending the blanket banking guarantee, again and again.

The result was spiralling public debt (from 25% of gdp in 2007 to 120% of gdp in 2013) pushing up the cost of government borrowing and forcing the government deficit to rise even further.

The decision by fianna fáil and the green party to pile banking debt onto the shoulders of the taxpayer paved the way for the humiliating handover of our economic sovereignty to the troika bailout programme in 2010.

During the 2011 general election fine gael and labour promised to do things differently. Enda kenny’s party promised that not another red cent would go to banks until bondholders started to share the pain. Eamon gilmore promised that if elected it would be labour’s way not frankfurt’s way.

But once in office these promises were broken.

A similar agenda was pursued by the government in london – cutting the block grant to the assembly and seeking to impose reductions in social welfare protections.

In addition to advocating domestic austerity the european union cut its own budget, a decision that was supported by fine gael, labour, the unionist parties and the british government. The result of this cut has been a significant reduction in much needed financial supports for island of ireland.

A new direction for the eu

For too long a cosy consensus has existed in irish politics. The consensus extends from economic and social policy to ireland’s relationship with the european union.

It is a consensus that looks after the few to the detriment of the many.

Fianna fáil, fine gael and labour are the yes men of europe. Whatever brussels and frankfurt propose they support. Their meps are the eus representatives in ireland – promoting the agenda of the eu institutions rather than the interests of people in ireland in the eu.

When the single currency was being created they were warned of the dangers, particularly for smaller and economically weaker member states. The dublin government ignored these warnings and signed up to a currency union that was fraught with flaws – a disaster waiting to happen.

They have endorsed wholesale the european commission’s right wing social and economic agenda

– stripping back the gains of earlier battles to build a social europe.

Over the past five years sinn féin has stood against this brussels consensus – we have highlighted the negative impact of the policies of austerity and the erosion of democracy on the lives of people across ireland. We have opposed cuts to the eu budget for important strategic sectors such as agriculture, regional development and investment in jobs and growth.

It is time for a new direction, in ireland and in the eu institutions.

It is time to stand up for ireland and the interests of all of the people who share this island.

It is time to end the brussels power grab, to reign in the commission and return powers to the member states.

It is time to halt the attack on the wages and conditions of working people and to promote a basic threshold of decency for all.

It is time to put in place real supports for those forced out of work by the policies of austerity.

It is time to rebuild our public services and defend our public utilities – to ensure that people get the services they need in a fair and efficient manner.

A bigger and stronger sinn féin team of meps from across ireland can raise the volume on these issues and demand a better deal for ireland.

Ireland’s place is in the european union – but the european union needs to change. Bringing that change about means electing meps that put ireland first; joining sinn féin mep martina anderson to stand up for ordinary people.

2. Ending the eurozone crisis

The euro crisis is not yet over. While some commentators are saying the worst has passed, for most people, nothing has changed. Indeed while disagreements exist between the european parliament, commission and council on the details of how to resolve the crisis, there is a broad consensus on principle. They all want ‘more europe’. This is code for the further transfer of power from member states to the eu institutions – political power, economic power and fiscal power.

Fiscal federalism will not stabilise the euro. Greater european commission control of member states budgets will not stabilise the euro. A ‘one size fits all’ monetary policy was part of the problem - adding a ‘one size fits all’ fiscal and budgetary policy will only make matters worse.

Sinn féin is firmly of the view that what is required now is a different approach based on investment, social and economic growth, breaking the link between banking and sovereign debt and greater flexibility for member states to decide the best strategies for recovery.

Economic policy should be decided in ireland - not in brussels or london- by politicians elected by and accountable to the irish people, north and south.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• an end to the failed policies of austerity that forces the burden of the economic adjustment on low and middle income families.
• a definitive breaking of the link between sovereign and banking debt.
• eu wide banking regulation that forces financial institutions to pay their fair share of the cost of the crisis not just in the future but from the start of the current crisis.
• a new focus on eu wide investment to get europe’s unemployed millions back to work.
• a new eu convention with an explicit mandate to identify competencies to be returned to member states.
• eu support for transfer of fiscal power from london to the assembly in belfast.

3. Getting people back to work

The eu urgently needs investment in jobs, particularly in the periphery. This can be achieved by combining the resources of member states, including the €6bn in the discretionary portfolio of the national pension reserve fund (now the ireland strategic investment fund), with an enlarged investment fund in the european investment bank (eib).

Sinn féin is arguing that the existing funds of the eib should be supplemented by a once-off investment by eu member states on a proportional basis – this could either be achieved by a transfer from assets currently held by the european stability mechanism or by new transfers from governments.

There is also a need for the government in dublin to increase its access to eib funds. In the six years since the start of the crisis the state has drawn down on average €600 million per year from the european investment bank through a variety of projects. During their first two years in office the amount of eib funding secured by fine gael and labour actually fell.

When compared to other member states, the failure of successive irish governments to take advantage of these funds is clear. Portugal, with a population of 10.5 million claimed 5% of the eib’s total loans in 2011 and 2012. During the same period the south of ireland, with a population of 4.6 million claimed only 1% of the eib’s loans in each year.

In the north, the executive is prohibited from borrowing directly from the european investment bank. Eib funding was accessed for the redevelopment of the university of ulster campus development works, but there is a need for the assembly to be able to directly access these funds.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• increasing the investment capacity of the eib to assist private and public sector jobs growth focusing on the range of investment types carried out by the eib.

• eu support for lifting the borrowing ban on the assembly to target investment particularly in areas with high levels of unemployment, poverty and social disadvantage.

• amending the eib funding ratio for member states with above average unemployment rates to 75:25 with the eib paying the larger portion.

• a real youth guarantee fund of €21bn to tackle the youth unemployment crisis – based on the funding model outlined by the international labour organisation and the national youth council of ireland.

• a trebling of the applications from the irish government to the eib to assist in funding job creation projects including:

• revival of the sugar beet industry and construction of a new bio-refinery plant in the south east with the potential to create 5,000 jobs.

• investing in the rollout of next generation broadband throughout the island.

• the a5/n2 motorway from derry to dublin.

• the western arc rail connection (galway – mayo – donegal – derry – belfast).

• invest in capital infrastructure at knock airport.

• upgrading our water infrastructure to reduce water leakage.

• buying, renovating and building social housing units.

• building additional schools and refurbishing existing schools.

• building extra primary health care centres

4. Protecting those in work

Since the start of the crisis, the wages and working conditions of low and middle income earners have been hit badly. Across both the public and private sector the majority of workers have seen their real wages decline and their terms and conditions eroded. The gap between low and middle earners on the one hand and high earners on the other has widened.

A recent study by the nevin economic research institute has shown that the recession has hollowed out the middle of the labour market. Many profitable companies are using the economic crisis to drive down wages and conditions.

Across the eu, labour’s share of national income has been in steady decline since the start of the recession. Here, however, the rate of decline has been particularly severe falling from almost 55% in 2009 to almost 45% today.

As a result we are seeing an increasing number of people in low paid jobs and an increase in the number of working families living at risk of poverty. According to the cso eusilc survey 25% of the population in the south are now officially deprived. A recent oxfam report showed that 22% of people in the north are living in poverty. According to the institute of fiscal studies relative and absolute child poverty rates are set to increase over the next decade to 30.9% and 38.5% respectively in the north. In many eu member states vital social services have been undermined by the eu led liberalisation of services. Sinn féin is not only opposed to the further liberalisation of public services such as education, health and portal services but will actively campaign for the reversal of this agenda in favour of strong publically funded and delivered social services.

The unquestioning support of fianna fáil, fine gael and labour for eu austerity policies has resulted in the south of ireland having significantly more low wage earners than the eu average. Westminster directed austerity in the north has ensured that 25% of workers in the north do not even make a living wage.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• decent wages for decent work and against the low wage culture.

• an end to zero-hours contracts at home and across the eu.

• legislation on the right to collective bargaining and protecting the right to strike.

• strengthen the protections for all workers, especially those in low paid sectors or working atypical hours, on fixed term contracts or working part time.

• the introduction of a social progress clause into the eu treaties in order to ensure that fundamental social rights and collective agreements on pay and conditions take precedence over the freedom of the markets.

• social clauses in procurement contracts to ensure a community dividend, particularly in areas of high unemployment, from public and private investment.

• all eu funding programmes to have an explicit and target driven role in promoting equality and social inclusion on grounds including gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and social class

5. Supporting those out of work

The eu jobs crisis was not an accident of nature. Policies pursued in brussels and supported across the member states created the crisis. In turn, measures introduced by the eu to help those out of work have been tokenistic, punitive, and often poorly implemented.

These initiatives have also been undermined by austerity policies pursued by the commission, particularly as part of the troika programmes in greece, portugal, cyprus and ireland.

The european globalisation adjustment fund is a case in point. The purpose of the fund was to provide supports for workers made redundant as a result of the relocation of jobs due to globalisation. It was subsequently expanded to include sectors of workers disproportionately affected by the recession. However, both its scope and its implementation left hundreds of thousands of workers across the eu short-changed. Since 2009 the fianna fáil/green party and then fine gael/labour governments have made five applications to the fund. The total amount provided to the state was €24.8 million to assist workers from dell, sr technics, waterford crystal, talk talk and the construction sector retrain and increase their employability. No applications have been made by the british government for redundant workers in the north.

To date almost 50% of this funding has been returned to the european commission because of a failure of both the fianna fáil green party government and their fine gael labour party successors to properly manage the money.

Not only has government mismanagement resulted in the return of millions of euros back to brussels, but the money that was spent was used to provide supports that the redundant workers would have had access to anyway, rather than to provide the additional tailored supports as intended by the programme.

While in the first instance the blame for this fiasco in the 26 counties must rest with the government, the commission has also failed to adequately monitor this programme.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• greater eu supports for people out of work including an expanded and reformed european globalisation adjustment fund.

• a real youth guarantee fund of €21bn to tackle the youth unemployment crisis – based on the funding model outlined by the international labour organisation and the national youth council of ireland.

• the right for the assembly to apply to the egaf for workers affected in the north.

• eu support for social clauses in public and private contracts targeting the unemployed and those recently completed education or training.

6. Dealing with the debt 

Irish taxpayers have poured an astonishing €65 billion into the failed banks that caused the financial crisis. The most expensive bank bailout in history has cost every man, woman and child in the state €13,956. No other eu or eurozone country has imposed such a heavy cost on its citizens.

The decision to bailout the banks at any cost has cost us 3 times more than iceland’s bailout, 4 times more than greece’s bailout, 10 times more than the spanish bailout, 23 times more than the portuguese bailout and 198 times more than the italian bailout.

By any measure the people of the 26 counties have shouldered more than their fair share. The banking crisis was as much european as it was irish.

In july 2012 the european council promised to break the link between sovereign debt and private banking debt. Yet today we continue to pay the costs of the banking crisis. Fine gael and labour’s much hyped 2013 promissory note deal has foisted a huge portion of this debt onto future generations.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt.

• the retrospective recapitalisation of aib and bank of ireland.

• a new deal on the promissory note lifting this odious debt from our children and grandchildren.

• a banking supervisory mechanism that makes banks pay their fair share of any future crisis.

7. Reforming the eu institutions

Public confidence in eu institutions is at an all-time low. According to eurobarometer – the eus official polling body - public trust in the eu institutions has halved since before the crisis.

Peripheral member states are bearing the brunt of unemployment, emigration and poverty. Low and middle income families, smes and family farmers are struggling to survive while the very wealthy and large corporations benefit.

Eu leaders and eu institutions have demonstrated beyond doubt that they are not capable of resolving the economic and social crisis caused by their policies.

The eu’s democratic deficit and calls for institutional reform are not new. However the crisis has exposed a more fundamental political crisis which urgently needs to be addressed.

Successive waves of treaty change from maastricht to lisbon have made matters worse not better.

The commission has too much power. The council is shrouded in secrecy. Larger member states have disproportionate influence in the council.

This has to change. The eu needs to be streamlined; it needs to focus on its core functions; its needs less power not more.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• an eu convention to engage in and open public debate, with an explicit mandate to identify competencies to be returned to member states as contained in the laeken declaration.

• reducing the power of the commission by ending its right to propose legislation without being requested to do so by the council or parliament.

• lifting the secrecy surrounding the european council by holding public meetings and providing full minutes.

• increasing the power of smaller member states by reforming the operation of qualified majority voting.

• increasing the number of meps elected from smaller member states.

• strengthening the ability of individual member state parliaments to influence legislative proposals.

• reducing the influence of corporate lobbyists in brussels.

• maintaining one commissioner per member state and making that commissioner accountable to the parliament of that member state through a process of approval by, and regular reporting back to, member state parliaments.

8. A better deal for rural & coastal ireland

The common agricultural policy is an important protection for farmers. It helps sustain rural communities and promotes jobs and families.

The reformed cap is a compromise between 28 member states; no member state achieved everything that they wanted for their agriculture sector.

Sinn fein argued for a well-funded cap and opposed the cuts proposed by britain and others in the eu, cuts supported by northern unionists.

Sinn féin supported the compromise. But we have continued to argue for greater flexibility in terms of its implementation by each member state.

The focus has now shifted on to member states and meps have a role in ensuring that the implementation of the new cap regime is fair and provides security to all our farming communities.

Historically cap has favoured a small minority of recipients who received the lion’s share of the single farm payment without having any greater productivity than those on lower payments.

We also want to see a reform of the inspection regime to ensure that the right balance is struck between ensuring compliance and the levels of administration required of farmers.

We need a better deal for all of rural ireland. It is vital therefore that implementation of the new cap regime includes a significant redistribution of funds towards the majority of farmers, many of whom are struggling to maintain a viable income.

Sinn féin supports the move towards a flat rate of payment for small farming families and wants to see it implemented preferably by 2015.

In terms of common fisheries policy sinn fein supported greater regionalisation and local decision making over fishing effort. Sinn fein wants to see a thriving sustainable fishing industry with greater opportunities for our fishermen in irish waters.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• a fairer distribution of agricultural supports to smaller struggling family farms.
• a move to a flat rate of single farm payment with greater support for the disadvantaged areas.
• a properly funded agri-environmental scheme to compensate farmers in disadvantaged and designated areas.
• the six counties to be treated as one region in terms of single farm payments.
• implementation of the growing for growth strategy creating 15,000 new jobs and levering in 1.4 billion in private sector investment.
• maximum regionalisation under common fisheries policy to bring greater local control over decision making on irish fishing effort.
• greater support for our fishermen to assist them with the increasing costs of fishing including a single boat payment in recognition of fishing as a primary producer.

9. Protecting the environment and promoting public health

Never before has the case for sustainable economic and ecological development been so clear. Climate change is an established fact. Our environment and biodiversity continue to be eroded by over reliance on fossil fuels, corporate pollution and unsound waste policies.

Despite this the last decade has seen a reduction in the number of environmental initiatives by the eu. There has also been a shift in policy focus from strict targets and limits in eu directives and a greater focus on ‘incentivising’ good corporate behaviour. Successive governments in the south of ireland have been among the poorest in europe in implementing eu environmental directives. This has led to an excessively high number of enforcement actions taken by the european commission. It has also undermined the process of implementation in a manner that would address the concerns of various interest groups.

This is most recently evident on the issue of turf cutting. Sinn féin supports the habitats directive and wants to see it transposed fully. However we also believe that rural dwellers tradition of sustainable turf cutting can be accommodated within the directive. Bad implementation by government has created an unnecessary standoff. Climate change is another area where government has failed to act. The european union is in the process of setting its climate targets for the next two decades. This will shape europe’s carbon emissions and renewable energy development until 2030. Sinn féin strongly believes that the eu must take on its fair share of the global effort to keep temperature rise well below 2°c.

Adopting ambitious, legally binding targets to curb greenhouse gases and stimulate energy efficiency and renewable energy will be essential if the eu is to play its part in combating climate change.

A strong eu 2030 package will ensure we bring a robust and united position to the summit in september 2014.

Sinn féin has argued that domestic climate change legislation must contain legally binding 5 year carbon budgets, an independent expert authority to advise and make recommendations to governments and a science based target for 2050.

Global environmental change does not respect borders. We have a single interconnected energy market. As an island it makes sense to promote all ireland environmental protection and energy policy. The island of ireland, with its exposure to wind and tidal energy, is well placed to utilise natural resources for the benefit of our people the eu needs to re-establish itself as a global leader in environmental practice and the irish government and the assembly must be more proactive in the setting of the policy agenda.

Central to this effort must be a shift in investment strategies in support of technologies that promote sustainable environmental development. Despite the talk of a green new deal very little in the way of actually deliver has materialised.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• urgent action on climate change with binding eu targets, including an eu net carbon account for the year 2050, at least 80 per cent lower than the 1990 baseline and an overall target reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 of between 20 to 30%.
• greater investment in renewable energy, improved regulation of wind farms and increased investment in wave and other energy sources.
• an eu wide ban on hydraulic fracturing (fracking).
• a review of the special areas of conservation to ensure full transposition of the habitats directive while allowing rural dwellers to continue the tradition of sustainable turf cutting.
• eu support for expanding ireland’s natural environment such as the liffey valley park.
• the withdrawal of local and central government support for the poolbeg incinerator.

10. Promoting public health

Whilst health is a competence for member state’s there are various initiatives at a european level where sinn féin meps can work to improve and promote public health and the wellbeing of our citizens.

Every year in ireland, 7000 people die from tobacco-related diseases. Deaths from lung cancer for irish women are the 4th highest in the eu and lung cancer is the most common cancer for both sexes.

Measures to reduce the attractiveness of cigarettes and other tobacco products must therefore be prioritised to stop generations of young people and children starting to smoke. Sinn féin will build upon work done on european legislation such as the tobacco products directive to ensure that this issue continues to be highlighted at a european level.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• stronger tobacco control measures to reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products, especially to young people.

11. Balanced regional development

Sinn féin recognises the added value a well-resourced and properly focussed structural funds programme can have in helping ireland, north and south, make real and sustainable recovery. Sinn féin has always prioritised regional development through membership of the eu parliament’s’ regional development committee. Ireland has benefited from structural funds down through the years. This expertise and knowledge should be harnessed fully to ensure the next round of funding is equally beneficial.

The structural funds should represent genuine added value and not be used to substitute for services and infrastructure the government should be providing anyway. We will campaign for structural funds to be focussed on reducing poverty and regional imbalances, building cross-border links to reduce the impact of partition and improving our social and physical infrastructure.

The weakening of the social elements of the eu’s regional policy has been on-going for more than a decade now. Sinn fein has opposed this dilution in brussels, strasbourg and on the ground at home.

We have vocally opposed the latest dilution through the “macro-economic conditionality” clause. This clause would allow the eu to stop funds like peace and the proposed youth guarantee in ireland because of the new austerity rules. This is akin to kicking ireland or any other country when they are down. The government say they are opposed to macro-economic conditionality but did not raise their voice against it when it mattered.

We have also opposed cuts to structural funds and peace funds.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• a fair and properly resourced regional development policy based on solidarity between regions.
• a peace iv which makes a real difference to peace building and is based on objective need.
• the maximum all-ireland cooperation on planning in the spending of funds.
• a social and environmental emphasis above competitiveness and other considerations in the design and implementation of ireland’s operational programmes and regional plans.
• the right of the assembly to draw down structural funds directly from the eu.
• maximise the opportunity to drawn down additional eu competitive funds.

12. Promoting irish unity

The eu has a role to play in peace building and supporting the implementation of the good friday agreement. This agreement provides for a border poll to determine the continued partition or reunification of ireland. The eu should continue to play a role in supporting the peace process, promoting cross border working and ultimately respecting and supporting any vote for reunification.

Partition fractured the economy of ireland. There are no advantages for an island nation of 6.4 million people on the edge of europe having two separate tax regimes, two currencies and legal systems, two public service systems and two separate competing economies.

The social, economic, political and cultural divisions that have become symptoms of partition have caused cross-border divergence that has resulted in almost a century of instability and conflict across the island. Partition has undermined economic development, particularly in border areas.

Harmonising structures across the island is central to creating a fully integrated and healthy economy and public services.

The border hampers trade, undermines workers’ rights and restricts economic growth. Many successful businesses face the added cost of cross border trade and barriers to expansion.

Councils along the border provide back to back services that could be provided in a more efficient an effective manner through cross border working between councils. Economic co-operation and co-ordination of trade, investment and progressive taxation could play a central role in securing a just, fair and healthy economy for the island as a whole. The starting point must be for maximum fiscal powers to be transferred to the north.

We have disconnected public service, programmes and centres of excellence. It has been illustrated that where joint enterprise is applied, such as in health, it makes economic sense.

The treaties of the european union oblige it to promote cross-border integration and to help overcome the negative effects of partition in ireland.

There are a number of steps which the eu could advance including:

• encouraging the development of integrated irish representation on eu issues.
• providing for the participation of ministers from the northern executive in the council of ministers.
• providing for the possibility of an ‘opt-in’ to eu legislation by the six counties where the british government has opted-out, in order to ensure that the whole island is operating within the same social and economic framework.
• developing a single eu support framework to ensure that strategic planning can take place on an all-ireland basis and that the eu can treat ireland as a single entity for funding purposes.
• promoting additional draw down of interreg funding.
• giving cross-border corridor groups a more strategic role in the allocation and distribution of funds.
• supporting the development of all-ireland public sector and civil society institutions and contributing to the establishment of cross-border economic development zones.
• exempting state aid to support irish integration and reunification from competition regulations
• systematically analysing the costs of continued partition as part of its contribution to an open, inclusive, informed and respectful debate on the benefits of irish unity.
• insisting that the good friday agreement be fully implemented by the british and irish governments.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• adequate funding and political support for the peace programme.
• a stronger all-ireland dynamic to eu funding.
• putting equality, social inclusion and sustainable development at the heart of eu funding regulations.
• additional eu funding for ireland in order to promote cross-border integration.

13. Reclaiming irish neutrality

The lisbon treaty gave the eu significant new powers to further develop common defence, security and foreign policies. While the economic crisis has slowed down the speed and depth of eu integration in these areas, they none the less continue to represent a serious threat to irish neutrality and sovereignty.

Sinn féin believes in positive neutrality. We are opposed to irish membership in any military alliance or common defence. We are also concerned with the increasing militarisation of the eu and the impact of the eu arms industry in conflict zones across the world.

14. Promoting human rights

Sinn féin supports the european human rights architecture and the objective of continent-wide upwards harmonisation of protections, because they serve the best interest of the irish people. We will insist that ireland upholds these human rights standards at home, and that the eu institutions also live up to their own human rights commitments.

European human rights guarantees are not enough. We need stronger domestic protections in ireland, starting with full implementation of the outstanding human rights commitments under the good friday agreement.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• a specific protocol attached to the eu treaties on irish neutrality similar to that secured by denmark.
• an end to irish participation in the evolving eu common defence and security policies.
• a ban on the export of eu manufactured arms to countries in conflict.
• an end to the linking of eu development aid and security policy.

15. Promoting irish at home and in the eu
Sinn féin has always argued that the european union has an important role to play in the promotion of irish language and culture. The recognition of irish as an official language of the eu, which sinn féin campaigned hard for, was an important achievement.

However the temporary derogation put in place in 2007 had meant that potential of this achievement has not been fully realised.

The derogation is due to end on the 31st of december 2016. However it could be brought to an end sooner and full recognition for irish could be in place. The ending of this derogation would provide 180 jobs in the eu institutions for irish language speakers for jobs such as interpreters, translators, lawyer-linguists

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:
• the irish government to apply to the european council to put an end to the derogation.
• increased investment by the irish government to ensure that we have a skilled workforce of translators, interpreters and lawyer-linguists to supply the increased positions arising from the end of the derogation.
• maintenance of official recognition and status for irish in the EU.
