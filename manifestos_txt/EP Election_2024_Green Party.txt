Introduction

Europe finds itself at a crossroads. Five years ago, tens of millions of Europeans voted for a fairer, greener, more hopeful Union. The Green wave has delivered unprecedented progress since - more ambitious climate action in areas from transport and housing to agriculture and energy, and the first serious efforts in nature restoration. The Irish Greens, with our fellow parties in the European Greens, have helped to set an agenda of radical change and deliver on the promises of the ‘climate election’. Europe has been turned finally onto a path of sustainability. After decades of effort, and as part of the EU, Ireland can play its part in the global fight for a green planet.
But the EU has also been rocked by a series of dramatic developments - from the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, to the COVID19 Pandemic and war in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere in the European neighbourhood, all while the climate situation deteriorates faster than the worst expectations of even the most experienced scientists.

In the face of such challenges, Europe faces a stark choice in this election. On one side, those who would destroy all the progress made in turning the earth back to a path of sustainability, who would endanger and attack democracy while driving division and hatred for their own gain. On the other, the Greens stand, as ever, for a more hopeful future; one where we cooperate and utilise all the science, creativity, innovation and determination the continent possesses to tackle the challenges and create a better world.
In the place of the nihilism of the far right, we offer courage; the courage to stand up and build a better world, not just through declaration of principles, but also the serious and hard work of legislation, campaigning, engagement and activism. We are a party that believes we can never stand on the sidelines while the world burns - we must engage with any and all that will work with us to create a better future for these and other generations.
Now, more than ever, it’s essential the Union moves forward together and completes the work started. Ireland remains hugely supportive of the European project, and we can play an important role in ensuring that it remains focused in the areas where it can affect positive change on the global level and resist the turn to a darker, more isolated and less democratic future.
Greens have fought effectively and seriously since 2019 to create change, not just to talk about it. Grace O’Sullivan MEP has improved EU efforts to tackle plastic pollution and waste at source, to ensure the sustainability and fairness of European fisheries and led on the 8th European Environment Action Programme. Ciaran Cuffe MEP negotiated the most ambitious renovation project in EU history, helped pioneer a future for sustainable aviation fuels, and led the Green fight to improve Europe’s transport infrastructure and road safety rules. Together, both have highlighted the plight of the people of Gaza, stood for humanity in the EU’s response to the migrant crisis and stood resolutely behind Ukraine, and against efforts to topple the Nature Restoration Law. With Senator Pauline O’Reilly, they are fighting for a positive future for all, and this is their manifesto for action.

Agriculture

A vibrant, sustainable, secure agricultural sector is vital to the social and economic life of rural Ireland. The EU continues to be the leading force influencing agriculture policy in Ireland, and one of the biggest global players, ensuring that Irish farming has access to a huge market of 450 million people, and beyond through EU trade agreements. This does not come without its challenges. Despite significant reform, the Common Agricultural Policy needs further improvement to ensure continued support for small farmers. The current emphasis on the amount of land farmed needs to shift towards paying farmers for producing food in a way that enhances the natural environment. Our vision for European and Irish agriculture is a diversified as well as environmentally and economically resilient sector, empowered to prepare for the changes coming in global food patterns and a warmer and wetter world. Climate change has already arrived, and Irish farmers are suffering from its consequences. EU agriculture policy will be essential to ensuring that Irish farmers can adapt and prosper.

As Greens, we will:

    • Fight for fair trade deals that ensure that Irish farmers are not put at a disadvantage by Europe’s efforts to lower the impact that food production has on our natural environment. Such deals can raise global standards through the ‘Brussels Effect’ when done correctly. Where they are not done correctly, we will oppose them. This includes the Mercosur trade deal, which Grace O’Sullivan MEP has actively opposed during the current mandate as member of the relevant EP Delegation.
    • See that the Common Agricultural Policy reform, in place since 2023, continues to lower inequalities in the payments system. We have supported these changes and the Convergence mechanism, which needs to benefit smaller scale farmers and ensure that family farms can continue to prosper.
    • Recognise that the CAP has moved from being a destructive force incentivising overproduction and the degradation of soil, to one that better recognises the importance of environmental protection and the role of farmers as guardians of the land. Pillar 1 agri-environmental schemes now play an essential role in the Green New Deal and reward responsible and hardworking farmers that improve and safeguard their land.
    • Act to see greater use of both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 funds to ensure greater diversity in our farming communities. Many farming areas face decline unless more young people, women and others are convinced to get into the sector.
    • Support the special promotion of organic agriculture, as a form of food production with lower negative impacts on soil, biodiversity and the climate. The number of organic farmers in Ireland has trebled since 2020, and existing schemes need to be enhanced and expanded to ensure the continued growth of the sector. Special dispensation for promotion of organics needs to be allowed at EU and national levels, such as in national and local public procurement of public food.
    • Ensure that the regulation and authorisation of pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals involved in agriculture be on the basis of the precautionary principle. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent gas price increases highlighted the exposure of EU agriculture to shortages of fertiliser and other materials.
    • Add a right to food as a principle in EU legislation, resulting in dedicated social security mechanisms to guarantee access to quality, sustainable food at national level.
    • Support small and ecological farming with significant investment.
    • Insist that the EU plays a crucial role in ensuring higher animal welfare standards in agriculture and other areas. Transport rules in particular to third countries need to be expanded, with core principles of minimisation of harm and distress to animals at the core of regulations. Transport times should not exceed 8 hours and there should be a ban on shipment of unweaned animals.
    • Ensure that Animal welfare considerations be incorporated into EU trade agreements to a greater extent.
    • Support the End The Cage and Fur Free Europe citizens initiatives.
    • Pursue a common EU forest fire strategy, and the minimisation of clear cutting policies in projects supported with EU funds.

Fisheries and Oceans

Ours is a blue planet, and Europe’s seas have never been more important both economically and to the health of the wider planet. The oceans produce two thirds of the world’s oxygen, are a crucial heat and carbon sink, as well as a source of food. Increasingly, they are also the source of other natural and economic wealth, as we move to create energy off our coasts and seek to protect our coastal ecosystems. As per Goal 14 of the SDGs we Greens want to ensure that our seas and oceans are restored to health, to preserve their natural benefits and the livelihoods of those that depend on them.

As Greens, we will:
    • Introduce a Seas and Oceans Law, to bring coherence to marine protection efforts and tie together national and EU laws to create clean, thriving seas in a fair and equitable way by 2030. We will base this on the progress made already under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.
    • Ensure that the Common Fisheries Policy must finally end overfishing and phase out harmful practices and subsidies. It must instead favour low-impact fisheries, an equitable and transparent quota system and sustainable consumption, all while ensuring fair and stringent application of the rules for all vessels.
    • Advocate that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) need better protection and fair designation in consultation with coastal communities.
    • Note that fishery imports need to ensure compliance with sustainability and minimum labour and fairness criteria, as must all third-party fisheries agreements.
    • Ensure that sustainable aquaculture will require strong planning enforcement and consultation, must be avoided in ecologically sensitive areas and should be a supplement to existing fisheries.
    • Push for a global moratorium on Deep Sea Mining, and continue to oppose all new offshore oil and gas exploration.
    • Insist that access to water is a basic right - we will prohibit privatisation of water resources always. We seek to use existing EU legislation to protect vulnerable reserves.

Housing

Europe is in a housing crisis, the effects of which are felt most acutely in cities such as Dublin. Across the EU, people are facing increasingly unaffordable rents, skyrocketing house prices, and rising energy bills caused by poorly-insulated, bad quality houses. Across Europe, approximately 900,000 people are sleeping rough or in shelters every night, and an estimated 125 million people are living in energy poverty. This situation is not an inevitable reality: it is time for the EU to recognise this crisis and the role it is playing, and offer solutions where it can. The scale and pervasiveness of Europe’s housing crisis demands swift and unified action at the EU-level that can support national and local authorities to take action. During this mandate, our Ciarán Cuffe MEP has negotiated the most ambitious renovation project in EU history, placing people living in energy poverty and other vulnerable groups at the heart of its programme. Further measures to boost renovation and construction will bring bills down for everyone, while the agreement reached will introduce further social protections and ensure EU funding for renovations for vulnerable groups is prioritised. In line with Goal 11 of the SDGs, we will pursue measures to ensure access to safe and affordable housing for all and to reduce the environmental impact of cities.

As Greens, we will:
    • Work to ensure the European Commission adopts a ‘European Housing Crisis Response Plan’ coordinated by a Commissioner responsible for the right to housing without delay.
    • Pursue a dedicated European Housing Fund to help address the €57 billion annual investment gap in social and affordable housing in the EU. With new EU renovation targets coming down the line, the Housing Fund should also prioritise and support renovations for people living in energy poverty, who will see the most benefit from these works.
    • Advocate for changes to EU laws like some state aid rules that are acting as barriers to public investment in affordable and social housing.
    • Lobby the Commission to develop a strategy to mitigate the impact of rising costs of construction materials, a problem that has been compounded by inflation and rising interest rates.
    • Hold EU member state leaders accountable for their stated commitment to end homelessness in Europe by 2030 under the 2021 Lisbon Declaration on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness. Insist on the reinforcement of the Platform with renewed ambition and its own budget.
    • Call on the European Commission and member state governments to treat homelessness as a multifaceted issue by linking it to policies on health, equality, migrations, and poverty.
    • Pursue an expanded legal proposal to curb the negative effects of short-term rentals on access to housing and enable stricter oversight in this area. Governments and cities should be able to put limits in place and even bans where needed. The Short-Term Rental Regulation negotiated by our Green colleague Dutch MEP Kim van Sparrentak will ensure that authorities will finally get the data they need to enforce the existing rules, and it should be implemented swiftly.
    • Pressure the Commission to refrain from intervention when local and national governments take proportionate measures designed to curb the negative effects of short-term rentals on access to housing in their areas. Private gain should not be prioritised over providing long-term affordable homes for people.
    • Support measures to counter speculative activities by investment funds that are driving up house prices. While private money is needed for building more homes, we must take action at a European level to counter damaging practices by investment funds. This should include establishing a transparency register of real estate transactions and ownership.
    • Call on the next Commission to analyse the EU’s contribution to the financialization of housing, and the acceleration of this process by the EU’s Capital Markets Union. This analysis should be followed by an action plan to tackle speculation through European legislation on banking, capital markets, state aid, budget, taxes, and mortgages.

Trade

Trade policy remains one of the EU’s most significant tools to create change in a globalised world. Access to the EU’s Common Market of 450 million people can help ensure that EU regulations to improve labour, environmental and other conditions are spread outside the continent, allowing Ireland to improve the lives of millions in a way that could never be achieved alone. As such, EU trade policy needs to be carefully considered and the European Parliament plays an increasing role in doing so. Balanced trade deals can enhance workers rights, increase mutual prosperity and advance European standards if done right. Bad deals can further concentrate wealth, harm European or third party producers (especially farmers and fishers) while increasing environmental damage.

As Greens, we will:
    • Approach all trade deals with the core principles of true sustainability, fairness and mutual benefit. We will advocate for the EU to make Green Deal Partnerships with countries, regions, and civil society actors to unlock as much investment in the green transition globally as it spends in the EU. We believe in reshaping the EU’s trade policy towards sustainable development and stronger human rights protection. The EU should only enter new trade deals with countries that implement the Paris Agreement.
    • Push the European Commission to investigate violations of the human rights and other obligations of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and to act accordingly to amend or suspend the agreement in the face of Israeli military and settlement activities in the West Bank and Gaza.
    • Seek to improve bilateral trade and investment agreements with binding and sanctionable sustainability provisions. Specifically, the Paris Agreement, the Kunming-Montreal biodiversity agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the ILO core conventions should become essential elements of our trade agreements. They need to be horizontally anchored in all chapters of trade deals, from raw materials and agriculture to procurement.
    • Oppose the Mercosur trade deal in its current form, as damaging to farmers, the environment and the principles of the Union.
    • Advance a new deal on mining and commodities, advocate for our sufficiency approach, backed up by reduction and recycling targets within the EU, to minimise the sector’s huge environmental and social impact. For rare earth metals, we call for a collective purchasing strategy.
    • Update the Public Procurement Directive and introduce a new Unfair Trading Practice for the textile sector.
    • Advocate rebalancing the global system of intellectual property rights to ensure the Global South can access key technologies, including for health and decarbonization. As Greens, we will push for reform at the World Trade Organization to support a global just transition.
    • Fight to end protections for fossil fuel investment, instead incentivising sustainable development. Freer trade should be paired with measures to limit environmentally harmful subsidies, including those for fossil fuels. Trade agreements should include measures to phase-out fossil fuel and other environmentally harmful subsidies.
    • Seek to abolish Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanisms and their replacement with a multilateral investment court system.
    • Insist that goods that are not authorised to be sold in the EU should not be exported to third countries.

The Union

The Union has benefited from the effects of the Lisbon Treaty - the European Parliament’s increased powers have altered the dynamic of the legislative process and gone some way to addressing the previous democratic deficit. Greens have long fought for a social and democratic Europe that moves beyond a mere common market and towards a more complete political union, with the rule of law, liberal values and the principles of equality for all at its heart. Recent challenges from Hungary and other member states that have failed to meet minimum standards for democracy, press freedom and rights for citizens have undermined the European project. As Greens, we want to see the line held, and the continued suspension of EU funds to member states that are in breach of their obligations. We support greater political and economic integration in order to better achieve our common aims of transforming our society to one that provides for all without costing the earth. Through its membership in the European Union Ireland can truly help to improve our world - we must continue to engage positively and constructively to help shape that more perfect union where we can.

As Greens we will:
    • Recognise that this election is one of the most crucial the European Parliament has faced since the first popular elections in 1979. The governing majority of centre left, centre and centre right looks likely to lose its majority for the first time. The rightward shift of the European People’s Party offers a prospect of the involvement of the hard right via the European Conservative and Reformists. Greens must work with those of the left and centre to ensure this does not happen, including building a progressive majority to protect the Green Deal and to exclude those that would destroy the very purpose of the European Union.
    • Safeguard democracy and the rule of law up to, and including, the invoking of Article 7 procedures to suspend the voting and other rights of member states, in the event of serious breaches. The need for unanimity in the application of Article 7 needs to be removed.
    • Recognise that for the EU to be able to work, it will have to change the way it functions. This will mean less unanimity and individual vetoes, more cooperation and more efficient processes. Keeping applicant countries in permanent limbo diminishes the promise and positive effects the prospect of EU membership can have on applicant countries - they must be dealt with honestly and supported as they work towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria.
    • Support the faster preparation of applicant states for full membership, including the Balkan states and Ukraine eventually.
    • Broadly support the latest treaty reform proposal of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and its aims to strengthen the role of the Parliament in the legislative process, as well as improvements to EU trade, education, foreign and security policy.
    • Advocate that further treaty change should be ratified by Europe wide referenda.
    • Fight for the European Parliament to have the power to initiate legislation, equal power over the budget, and to nominate the president of the Commission.
    • Continue the fight for Eurobonds as the best insurance against the boom and bust cycle, and push for the extension of the Next Generation EU recovery fund until they are delivered. The EU failed the political test of the 2008 economic collapse, but succeeded in the face of the global pandemic, stabilising European economies and allowing them to continue spending at a time of need. The EU’s budgetary policy needs to learn these lessons and ensure the MFF contains strong counter-cyclical elements. Only with this can we move from ‘austerity Europe’ to ‘social Europe’.
    • Support expansion of the EU’s Own Resources through new charges such as a plastics levy and a real Europe wide fossil fuel tax, to help generate funding that can be used to help those engaging with the transition and finally close the loopholes for those industries not paying their fair share.
    • Seek to revise the mandate of the European Central Bank to include full employment alongside price stability. As fossil fuels are vulnerable to price hikes and drive inflation, we also want the ECB to make use of all tools at its disposal to encourage green investment, including differentiated interest rates.

International Affairs, Security and Defence

Europe’s economy has been through a number of disruptions since the last election, from the Covid19 pandemic to the war in Ukraine and subsequent energy and material shortages. These in turn have led to supply chain disruption and inflation. Despite these challenges, the European and Irish economies remain strong, largely due to the Union’s counter cyclical Next Generation EU and other recovery funds. At the same time, challenges to infrastructural development are continuing, from labour and material shortages to an incomplete Capital Markets Union that saps certainty and lowers investment in innovation and development across the Union. Some member states are pursuing reindustrialisation strategies and economic protection as a reaction to a more uncertain world. As Greens, we want to see a European economic and industrial policy that enables alternative economic models such as cooperatives, crowdfunding, social entrepreneurship and the commons; one that is guided by the Sustainable Development Goals and brings them closer to reality. This will require the difficult work of engaging with the very fundamentals of the EU’s economic underpinning, and we are ready for the task.

As Greens, we will:
    • Push for a Green and Social Transition Fund equivalent to a minimum of 1% of EU GDP per year, mainly financed by joint borrowing at the EU level. This will fund green infrastructure projects such as renewable energy, public transport and energy efficiency.
    • Establish a minimum level for capital gains tax in the EU to rebalance the tax burden away from employees. We will close loopholes in the OECD corporate minimum tax agreement and push EU member states to implement the agreement at a higher level.
    • Insist that Europe must extend the carbon border tax to new polluting sectors, apply the polluter pays principle to all, and abolish free EETS quotas ahead of the current 2034 date. We will increase the scope of existing taxes on plastics.
    • Push to massively increase the size of the EU Social Climate Fund to ensure a just transition for low-income households.
    • Call for an EU-wide wealth tax and financial transactions tax to fight inequality and finance the green transition while curbing speculation. We will make the EU windfall tax on energy companies permanent to prevent profiteering in future energy crises and apply it to commodity traders and banks too.
    • Fight to revise the Green Taxonomy to make sure that gas and nuclear are not greenwashed as “sustainable”.
    • Oblige financial actors to adopt robust climate transition plans.
    • Fight to include all banking activities in the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, so the sector is accountable for the human rights, environmental and climate impact of its investments.
    • Work to see that the EU completes its much overdue banking union and introduces a common deposit insurance system. Households should no longer end up lining the pockets of financial players speculating on food, energy and housing or bear the fallout of financial crashes.
    • Advocate for the European Central Bank to offer differentiated interest rates to drive green investment and mitigate the effects of inflation.
    • Make sure that the EU uses its international influence to motivate countries such as the United States to join the Rome Statute and the International Criminal Court, to make sure that human rights are protected globally.
    • Tackle the root causes of conflict, strengthening civilian conflict prevention, mediation, and reconciliation as well as crisis management beyond borders, including peacebuilding, peacekeeping, and enforcement via the United Nations and other relevant bodies.
    • Confirm that military interventions must only ever be the last resort. They must be based on long-term political strategies, comply with international law, and be subject to the relevant parliamentary approval and oversight.
    • Insist that in Israel/Palestine, that the EU relaunch political negotiations towards a two-state solution, based on secure and agreed borders. We demand full accountability through independent investigations into any potential violations of international law by all parties.
    • Recognise the parallels between Cyprus and Ireland’s political circumstances as divided islands, and call for the resumption of talks on a solution to the Cyprus issue under the auspices of the UN.
    • Recommend Ireland join a limited number of PESCO projects in the areas of cybersecurity and the protection of critical infrastructure at sea, recognising that enhanced cooperation with other EU Member States will better equip Ireland to protect ourselves against new, hybrid threats while respecting our neutrality. The increasing threat of disinformation and interference in sovereign democracies is a particular concern and must be met by robust cybersecurity efforts.
    • Advocate for an active, clear-eyed, and common EU policy on China, including a robust human rights policy that starts with de-risking our supply chains and increasing our self-sufficiency.
    • Fully support nuclear and conventional arms control and disarmament, including a ban on autonomous lethal weapons and support for the Treaties on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Non-Proliferation. We call for an EU-level arms policy that prohibits arms exports to authoritarian regimes, dictatorships and human rights abusers while supporting countries defending themselves against aggressors. Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms for arms exports to all partners must be introduced.
    • Support policies that improve exchange and information flows between European police and intelligence services and would create a Europe-wide exchange programme for police officers.

Migration and Asylum

Migration is one of the most serious issues facing the EU in a dangerous, unequal and rapidly warming world. Climate change continues to disrupt economies as much as ecosystems, creating economic and social instability that often fuels wars and other conflict. Europe has to date failed to create a system that handles this reality with the humanity that the principles of the EU demands, as we saw in the reaction to the crisis in the Mediterranean in 2019. The EU’s own Frontex agency has faced serious scandals and allegations of the minimisation of human rights and other concerns, to the extent that EU border protection is becoming discredited. Ireland needs to cooperate with other EU and third party states to realise a system that processes asylum applications quickly and fairly, honours our international and humanitarian obligations and helps new arrivals to integrate as fast and as well as is possible.

As Greens, we will:
    • Demand a fair asylum system that defends human rights and dignity. We will continue to work towards a migration policy that recognizes the immense contribution that migrants make to our societies.
    • Push for the best possible implementation of the Asylum and Migration Pact, with careful monitoring of human rights standards, humane treatment of minors and their families, and with mechanisms for penalising any member states abusing the new systems.
    • Advocate urgent reform of Frontex to ensure that its human rights monitoring and internal culture issues are addressed.
    • Act to stop violence, torture, and inhuman and degrading treatment at Europe’s borders. Illegal pushback at the borders of the EU must end.
    • Call for an EU-funded and led Search and Rescue Mission in the Mediterranean.
    • Seek to end the criminalisation of humanitarian assistance, and the overuse of states of emergency to limit access to asylum and oversight by civil society and media. The case of Irish man Sean Binder serves as a reminder of the fact that compassion must not be made a crime.
    • Oppose so-called “migration deals”, such as that with Tunisia - the EU cannot believe that these offer long-term alternatives.
    • Develop a new, comprehensive and rules-based Migration Code, providing for visa opportunities for family reunification and work at different skills levels whilst facilitating the quick processing of applications.
    • Combat human trafficking and labour exploitation in the EU.
    • Reverse the steady re-emergence of illegal border checks within the Schengen area.

Environment, Energy, Climate and Nature

Europe’s environment and energy sectors are undergoing a transformation driven by the urgent need to address climate change and protect our natural world. The Green Deal has been a pivotal part of this transformation, but much more remains to be done to secure a sustainable future for all.
As Greens, we will:
    • Seek to ensure full climate neutrality by 2040 and end the EU’s dependency on coal, gas, and oil.
    • Push for a 100% renewable energy system by 2040, through significant investments in wind, solar, and other renewable sources.
    • Support electrification of home heating.
    • Pursue the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the fairest way possible. The EU has to be serious in protecting its industries while pursuing the highest possible climate ambitions, and through a CBAM can help to incentivise decarbonisation of supply chains globally.
    • Recognise Green hydrogen as a future resource, one that must be reserved for backup, heavy industry and marine and aviation transport fuel generation.
    • End fossil fuel subsidies by 2026 and all other environmentally harmful subsidies by 2027. There can be no EU money for dirty infrastructure.
    • Seek to develop and invest in alternatives to short-haul flights in Europe wherever possible.
    • Extend the application of the European Emission Trading Scheme to long haul European flights in the same way that it is already applied to short haul flights. Aviation fuels being exempt from taxation is inexcusable in a climate crisis - this subsidy must end.
Nature Restoration
    • Insist that 10% of the EU budget be allocated to a fund to achieve biodiversity objectives from 2026.
    • Build a trans-European Network for Nature to facilitate animal migration patterns.
    • Pass and implement the Nature Restoration Law to restore degraded areas, while working with fishers, farmers, local communities and other key stakeholders to ensure they understand the impacts and benefits.
    • Realise EU commitments to biodiversity protection and nature restoration under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
Adaptation
    • Introduce a Climate Adaptation law based on ecosystem based solutions.
    • Expand the EU Solidarity Fund to focus on climate adaptation.
    • Create a European Natural Disaster Fund and increase coordination of emergency services.
Zero Pollution
    • Work for an EU level increase in mandated air quality standards to meet WHO guidelines by 2030.
    • Build on the success of the REACH Regulation and pass a stronger chemicals law, to phase out many of the most harmful remaining chemicals by 2030.
Renewable Energy for All
    • Support an Energy Guarantee to provide all households with sufficient energy at an affordable price, including targeted supports and energy saving investment for vulnerable groups to eliminate energy poverty.
    • Develop and deploy storage technologies like batteries and vehicle-to-grid - huge expansion in these and interconnection will be essential to delivering a fully renewable European grid.
    • Push to create an EU level programme to renovate homes of those most in need through a large scale social energy renovation programme, ensuring that all citizens can live in healthy and fossil free homes by 2040. These supports must be targeted, and cost neutral for tenants.
    • Ensure the full implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, as negotiated by Ciarán Cuffe MEP, to ensure that new buildings in the EU meet high standards of efficiency and keep citizens warm in their homes at lower cost.

Transport and Mobility

Transformation of Europe’s transport systems is a key part of the Green Deal and to decarbonising European society. We Greens have been pushing for decades to create affordable alternatives that will offer all citizens the choice to travel, commute and move without polluting the air and putting themselves in harm’s way. Europe has begun the transition to a new transport future, one that rewards and facilitates those using less damaging active and public transport options, that transitions from the internal combustion engine to electrification of transport wherever possible. The EU needs to hold fast in the face of resistance to the phase out of internal combustion engines, to continue to coordinate and build the alternatives to flying while also playing a global role in the decarbonisation of aviation, shipping and trucking, all of which can create green jobs in Ireland and promote energy independence. The EU must play a crucial role in the coordination of the European rail network. We also recognise the hidden benefits that interconnection can provide by allowing citizens to travel more widely, to meet people from different walks of life, and to discover more about European cultures and history.

As Greens, we will:
    • Push to expand the DiscoverEU action and offer free interrail tickets each year to all 18-year-olds, and to improve accessibility for travellers of all abilities.
    • Lobby for a single SailRail ticket to cover entire journeys to and from continental Europe across multiple transport modes.
    • Advocate for a ban on private jets in the EU.
    • Protect passengers and workers through new road safety standards and an EU level speed limit, and create an EU agency for road transport that would deal with safety and emissions testing.
    • Introduce limits on the size and power of SUVs to lower environmental and safety risks.
    • Continue to phase out of Internal combustion engines on schedule, and encourage the second hand EV market by mandating their use in corporate and public fleets.
    • Increase funding available for Ireland under the EU transport fund (the Connecting Europe Facility).
    • Support the development of truly renewable fuels for use in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as shipping and aviation. Under the RefuelEU Aviation, negotiated by Ciarán Cuffe MEP, we have to increase use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to 70% by 2050, and these should come primarily from synthetic fuels, electricity and green hydrogen, all of which can be produced in Ireland.
    • Insist that biofuels remain the last resort for the decarbonisation of transport, and that attendant Land Use and Land Use Change effects are fully factored in when assessing their use.
    • Incorporate pollution information into ticketing, and tax air travel and its fuel appropriately. We will support the introduction of a frequent flyer levy with exceptions for island regions.
    • Increase investment and coordination of rail transport development to literally connect the union, including more regular night and high speed train capacity, and the creation of a European Ticketing Platform.

A Social Europe: Labour and Social Rights, Education and Health

A social Europe is one where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, where labour and social rights are upheld, education is accessible, and health care is provided to all. The European Greens are committed to creating a fair and inclusive society that leaves no one behind.
As Greens, we will:
    • Push for the full implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 3 for good health and wellbeing, ensuring universal access to healthcare.
    • Advocate for an EU Health Force to be established to respond to health emergencies.

    • Work towards a renewed LGBTQIA+ Equality Strategy to protect the rights of trans, intersex, and non-binary people.
    • Support the EU Action Plan Against Racism and its renewal for 2025.
    • Demand adequate funding for the European Child Guarantee to ensure children have access to care, education, healthy nutrition, housing, and healthcare.
    • Promote the inclusion of older people in policy matters and support their participation in the WHO’s Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities.

Labour Rights

    • Revise the Work Life Balance Directive and the Maternity Leave Directive to advance towards fully paid maternity and paternity leave of equal length.
    • Support trade unions in ensuring that workers get their fair share.
    • Reduce the tax burden on workers and support access to essentials for the poorest by increasing taxes on polluters and the ultra-rich.
    • Dismantle exploitative internship systems and replace unpaid internships with proper pay and safe working conditions.
    • Update occupational health and safety measures for climate change realities.
    • Prevent workers from being monitored by AI-based surveillance tools.
    • Fight for equal pay for equal work and equal opportunities at work.
    • Introduce measures to reduce working time and improve work-life balance, including an EU Right to Disconnect and Right to Remote Work.
    • Tackle precarious employment practices with better minimum EU standards.

Education and Research

    • Introduce an Erasmus Equality Principle to make the programme accessible for all.
    • Advocate for equal accessibility to Erasmus+.
    • Forge a Green and Social Deal to introduce shared responsibilities in education and research.
    • Increase European support for research to contribute towards scientific and technological development.

Industry, Finance, and Development

Europe’s economy has been through a number of disruptions since the last election, from the Covid19 pandemic to the war in Ukraine and subsequent energy and material shortages. These in turn have led to supply chain disruption and inflation. Despite these challenges, the European and Irish economies remain strong, largely due to the Union’s counter cyclical Next Generation EU and other recovery funds. At the same time, challenges to infrastructural development are continuing, from labour and material shortages to an incomplete Capital Markets Union that saps certainty and lowers investment in innovation and development across the Union. Some member states are pursuing reindustrialisation strategies and economic protection as a reaction to a more uncertain world. As Greens, we want to see a European economic and industrial policy that enables alternative economic models such as cooperatives, crowdfunding, social entrepreneurship and the commons; one that is guided by the Sustainable Development Goals and brings them closer to reality. This will require the difficult work of engaging with the very fundamentals of the EU’s economic underpinning, and we are ready for the task.

As Greens, we will:
    • Push for a Green and Social Transition Fund equivalent to a minimum of 1% of EU GDP per year, mainly financed by joint borrowing at the EU level. This will fund green infrastructure projects such as renewable energy, public transport and energy efficiency.
    • Establish a minimum level for capital gains tax in the EU to rebalance the tax burden away from employees. We will close loopholes in the OECD corporate minimum tax agreement and push EU member states to implement the agreement at a higher level.
    • Insist that Europe must extend the carbon border tax to new polluting sectors, apply the polluter pays principle to all, and abolish free EETS quotas ahead of the current 2034 date. We will increase the scope of existing taxes on plastics.
    • Push to massively increase the size of the EU Social Climate Fund to ensure a just transition for low-income households.
    • Call for an EU-wide wealth tax and financial transactions tax to fight inequality and finance the green transition while curbing speculation. We will make the EU windfall tax on energy companies permanent to prevent profiteering in future energy crises and apply it to commodity traders and banks too.
    • Fight to revise the Green Taxonomy to make sure that gas and nuclear are not greenwashed as “sustainable”.
    • Oblige financial actors to adopt robust climate transition plans.
    • Fight to include all banking activities in the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, so the sector is accountable for the human rights, environmental and climate impact of its investments.
    • Work to see that the EU completes its much overdue banking union and introduces a common deposit insurance system. Households should no longer end up lining the pockets of financial players speculating on food, energy and housing or bear the fallout of financial crashes.
    • Advocate for the European Central Bank to offer differentiated interest rates to drive green investment and mitigate the effects of inflation.

Defending Democracy, Justice, and Digital Rights

Democracy seems under threat in much of the world, with online mis- and dis-information posing a significant threat to the very concept of truth. Digital media companies continue to have a disproportionate effect on our politics, as traditional print and broadcast institutions struggle to adapt to a fast-changing environment. The Greens in the European Parliament have long been the leading force for a strong EU Digital policy, one that guarantees basic freedoms of privacy and control over one’s data, often in the face of seemingly insurmountable pressure from industry. We will protect the right to assembly while expanding the democratic franchise. Only at the level of the EU can we hope to create truly effective controls that ensure the principles of truth, freedom of speech and an informed citizenry can survive and prosper in the Internet Age.
As Greens, we will:
    • Ensure that social media companies must be subject to public scrutiny and transparency on the removal of illegal content, whilst being empowered to protect free speech and democratic exchange.
    • Support civil society organisations and media initiatives promoting media literacy and anti-hate strategies.
    • Ensure that there is adequate EU legislation to protect citizens against the abuse of spyware and stop member states from evading accountability by evoking national security.
    • Argue that Artificial Intelligence must work for people, society, and the planet, not for surveillance states or tech capitalism. The new EU AI Act must be made to work.
    • See that Cybersecurity efforts be increased to prevent AI-based hacking attacks, with a special emphasis on protecting critical infrastructure.
    • Also ensure that AI promotes instead of hampering the Green Deal, with key environmental provisions for development, deployment and in energy provision.
    • Push for an EU Digital Fairness Act to protect people from intrusive online advertising practices.
    • Legislate to increase the reuse and recycling of devices and components, and cut the energy consumption linked to data processing and cryptocurrency to significantly reduce the internet’s material and energy footprint.
    • Continue to fight for votes for 16-year-olds for all elections in Europe, and the right to stand as a candidate from 18, starting with the European elections.
    • Support the exploration of transnational lists for the European Parliament, via the creation of an additional single EU-wide constituency.
    • Explore a framework for EU-wide referenda.
    • Pursue an end to the violation of EU law and core principles by member states through infringement procedures, with a clear timeframe and up to and including Article 7 procedures.
    • Introduce a Fundamental Values Annual Review to monitor, enforce and sanction the infringement of fundamental values across the EU.
    • Continue our work on the comprehensive reform of legislation on lobbying activities at EU level, including a mandatory EU transparency register.
    • Support the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office as the bodies responsible for protecting the EU’s financial interest, and call for greater resources for anti-corruption efforts.
    • Defend the right to assembly and peaceful demonstration in line with international and European law.
Journalistic Freedom
    • Recognise the need for an EU framework to prevent media concentration and enable journalists to work freely.
    • Closely monitor the application of EU law, in particular those on copyright, trade secrets, the data protection regulation, and the Audio-Visual Media Services Directive, to ensure they are not abused.
    • Work towards the proper implementation of the future Media Freedom Act and anti-SLAPPs (Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation) directive.
