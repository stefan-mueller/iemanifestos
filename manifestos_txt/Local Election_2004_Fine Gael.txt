In this Local Election Manifesto, Fine Gael sets out ideas on how politics can really work for people: in their homes, in their communities, where they work, whether it’s in the heart of the city or of the country.

Irish society is changing, subtly but certainly. The ‘selfishness’ of the last ten years is being replaced by a desire to belong, to feel part of a community. Today, people want Government that cares about the reality of the lives they are living, for example, how the cost of living is soaring, how tough it is being marooned in estates miles from work, schools and public transport, their worries about health care, their rising concern about childcare when two salaries are needed to pay the mortgage, the question of respect and security in old age, the need to feel safe in their neighbourhood and on the streets.

This manifesto contains ways to address all of these and make life better, more rewarding and secure. It shows what can be achieved by proper planning, when politics has a vision for the future and a desire to care and work for the people and not, first and foremost, for ‘the Party’.

It’s less than three years to the next General Election. But at that election, people won’t just be choosing between candidates, or parties, or leaders, they will be making up their minds on something infinitely more important: the kind of Ireland they want to live in. An Ireland where the people come first, led by Fine Gael? Or an Ireland where ‘the Party’ comes first, led by Fianna Fail and the PDs? That’s the choice.

But the process of choosing starts much earlier: on 11th June next. The Local Elections are the first opportunity for people to show their rejection of a Government incapable of keeping its word, that taxes them by stealth, that has made no-go areas of town and cities, that plans to close down vital A&E facilities and replace them with ambulance traffic.

It’s time for change. Fine Gael wants to lead that change and create a better, more equal, caring Ireland. It’s time to give people a reason to hope, believe and trust again in politics and politicians. If we don’t, we are failing them, because if we allow people to drift away from politics, we are denying them their democratic right to share in the decisions that affect their lives.

Fine Gael will put the people first, because we seek to govern not to rule, but to serve. We have over 740 candidates who will abide by those principles to create a better, more honourable and caring Ireland. So, let’s see what we can achieve, as a nation, when we work together for a higher good that all of us can share in – investors, entrepreneurs, taxpayers, parents, pensioners and volunteers alike.

“It’s time for change. Fine Gael wants to lead that change and create a better, more equal, caring Ireland. It’s time to give people a reason to hope, believe and trust again in politics and politicians.”

INTRODUCTION BY BERNARD ALLEN TD

Following seven years of Fianna Fail/PD rule, our local communities are in need of radical solutions to real problems.

This manifesto outlines Fine Gael’s proposals for dealing with problems that are damaging communities- problems like access to housing, high rates of crime, the rip-off culture, traffic, planning and access to services.

The key highlights of this manifesto are;
• A special package for first time house buyers. An SSIA type scheme to help them save, abolition of stamp duty on second-hand homes bought by first-time buyers and a frontloading of mortgage interest relief to help them in the early years of mortgage repayments.
• Measures to tackle the scandal of unfinished housing estates.
• A Consumer Rights Enforcer to tackle rip-off Ireland with powers being devolved to Local Authorities to name and shame local rip-offs.
• Outlawing the rip-off practices of gazumping and staged payments.
• Extra resources to the Gardaí. Tackling violent crime will be a key priority. A dedicated Organised Crime Unit within the Gardaí should be established.
• A Home Detention Curfew Scheme and electronic tagging should be used to tackle juvenile offenders in a cost effective way.
• Through the creation of Local Crime Prevention Councils, we would create an entirely new overseer role for the Local Authority, dedicated to security and policing matters in their own local authority area.
• Fine Gael will also introduce Civic Wardens to supplement and support the work of the Gardaí. We want to consult with well-established and valued voluntary and community organisations such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch in establishing the Service.
• Fine Gael is opposed to the closure of vital A&E services in local hospitals. Fine Gael believes that a hospital is not a hospital unless it has a doctor on-site 24 hours a day. We are committed to ensuring that at a minimum every hospital has such a service.
• An Independent Commission on Rural Housing to recommend changes to the law if necessary, as well as developing feasible policy measures to address this complex issue.
• We will establish a Rezoning Review Board, headed by a High Court judge, to scrutinise every rezoning decision made at Council level to ensure the decision is sensible and is in the public good.
• Fine Gael believes that the concept of directly elected mayors should be piloted in the country’s major cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.
• Fine Gael will establish a new Dublin Transport Authority to take over the existing powers from the 20 separate groups/agencies that currently have some responsibility for transport. All public transport bodies would be answerable to the DTA for the service they provide.

1. Tackling the Housing Crisis

Issue:

Since Fianna Fail and the PDs took power, the price of a home has tripled. The average price for a house in Dublin is now €314,000. Outside Dublin, the average price is €208,000. As a result, homeownership has become impossible for many young people who find getting on the property ladder too expensive.

Added to this, is an ever-growing waiting list for local authority housing. Over 100,000 individuals are waiting in the queue for social housing for themselves and their families.

Instead of tackling the housing crisis, the Government has reaped a taxation windfall from the surge in the price of new homes. The Government takes approximately 45% of the cost of every new house in taxation. In 2003, the Government netted over €5 billion from taxation on new homes.

Stance:

Fine Gael believes that a range of measures are required to address the “affordability gap” which prevents people who have incomes buying their own homes. We also need innovative ways of tackling supply and demand issues.

Proposals:

For First Time Buyers
• A House Deposit Savings Scheme, similar to the SSIA scheme to help young people who are saving for a deposit for a new home. Under the scheme, first time buyers will receive €1 for every €3 they save provided those savings are used for a deposit on a house. No tax on interest will apply. The recipient must show regular monthly savings for a minimum of 2 years. The scheme will operate for both new and secondhand houses
• Abolish stamp duty on second-hand homes up to €400,000 bought by first time buyers. This will mean that a first time buyer purchasing a second-hand home which cost €325,000 would save €14,625
• Frontload mortgage interest relief for first time buyers to the first seven years of the life of a mortgage, thereby giving first time buyers the help when they most need it.

To Ease Demand and Increase Supply
• Reform the social welfare code that currently forces young people out of the family home, adding upward pressure on house rents and prices. The income of parents should no longer be taken into account when deciding on the welfare entitlements of those who remain at home.
• Refocus tax incentives for developers by providing incentives for the voluntary sector and those who intend to build sheltered housing for the elderly.
• Refocus tax incentives for house buyers by offering elderly people who wish to ‘trade down’ incentives to do so, thus freeing up under-utilised accommodation.
• An urgent investigation by the Competition Authority into reports of building land hoarding in the Greater Dublin area and an investigation into house price increases, which increased in excess of 10% in the year ended 30th June 2003. Building materials only increased in that period by 0.6%.

To Help Rural Ireland
• An Independent Commission on Rural Housing must be given the power to recommend changes to the law if necessary, as well as developing feasible policy measures to address this complex issue. The Government’s recently issued ‘guidelines’ on one-off rural housing mean nothing and will not result in any tangible change in rural housing policy.
• The Commission will examine all issues surrounding rural housing including:
• Existing planning practice
• Waste management implications
• Infrastructure requirements All interest groups must be represented and the Commission should be asked to report within six months.

Towards a Better Housing Policy
• A National Housing Agency. It is envisaged that the existing Housing Finance Agency will be expanded and strengthened to take on a new role in assisting Local Authorities meet housing targets. The new body will be accountable to the relevant Dáil Committee.

Functions:
(i) Monitoring of County Development Plans to ensure consistency with the Strategic Planning Guidelines and the National Development Plan investment programme
(ii) Liaising with other State Agencies so that transport, educational and recreational needs can be planned in tandem with accommodation provision.
(iii) Driving the servicing of lands identified for housing by Local Authorities. This may involve direct management of provision of water and drainage facilities where the lack of expertise or manpower by individual Local Authorities is inhibiting the supply of housing.
(iv) At the request of the Local Authorities concerned the Agency could also take responsibility for coordinating land servicing across Local Authority boundaries where joint schemes are more appropriate and cost efficient.

• All Housing Authorities must give an account of the action they have taken to implement the provisions of the Traveller Accommodation Act and, where Local Authorities have failed, the legislation should be modified to enable the Government to enforce compliance.

Tackling Homelessness
• A fully integrated homelessness policy should be adopted to tackle homelessness. This should include measures preventing people becoming homeless, as well as provision for those who are already without a home. Fine Gael opposes the Government’s ‘Six Month Rule’ on rent supplements and all the other welfare cuts that will help drive more people further into poverty and homelessness.

Housing for People with Disabilities
• The Disabled Persons Housing Grant Scheme (DPG) is characterised by long waiting lists, unacceptable waiting times, lack of adequate resources and arbitrary application. According to the Disability Federation Of Ireland Local Authorities now operate different eligibility and application procedures and pay different amounts. The result of these reviews is that people with disabilities are being left in hospital contributing to waiting lists, housed inappropriately in nursing homes, going on to housing lists and living in inaccessible, unsuitable and potentially dangerous homes. This causes immeasurable strain for the individuals concerned and their families.

We propose that Local Authorities increase the DPG to cover 100% of the actual cost of the approved building work in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Individual local authority review measures should be scrapped and a national standardised process developed. We also propose that each Local Authority house should have a bathroom, toilet and central heating provided.

Homeownership has become impossible for many young people who find getting on the property ladder too expensive.

2. Tackling Crime
Issue:
• Since this Government has been in office there has been an enormous increase in crime rates. Headline offences have increased by 20,000. This figure may float up and down by a percentage or two but the big picture remains the same. This Government has failed to tackle serious crime.
• Detection rates for headline offences fell from 41% in 2001 to 39% in 2002. Fine Gael/MRBI research revealed that 1 in 5 crimes are not reported.

In their Programme for Government, both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised 2,000 extra Gardaí. Yet two years later, there is no sign of even one of these extra Gardaí on the beat.

Due to manpower and resource issues, the Gardai are increasingly fighting rearguard actions in large urban areas where social disadvantage and organised crime are on the increase. In some areas, a rift has developed in the relationship between the public and the Garda Siochana. Although the Gardaí still enjoy the support of a majority of citizens, people are increasingly disappointed with their dealings with the force.

Stance:
Cutting crime needs to be addressed at a number of levels. Garda resources must be increased and structures improved, whilst innovative ways of involving the community must also be developed.

Proposals:

Tackling Serious Crime
• A dedicated Organised Crime Unit within the Gardaí should be established.
• Fine Gael will provide extra resources to the Gardaí. Tackling violent crime will be a key priority.
• The Government must urgently address the rising number of gangland killings. Witness intimidation is a sinister factor, which has hampered the effectiveness of investigations into gang related crime. All evidence in gang related investigations should be videotaped. This will deal with witnesses who may later succumb to memory loss or intimidation. This evidence could be used in a court of law if the witness refused to support his original statement. A provision should be made to allow the swearing in of witnesses in other jurisdictions and evidence to be given by video link when a witness is unwilling to travel from abroad due to fear of violent consequences.

Tackling Public Order Offences
• A Home Detention Curfew Scheme and electronic tagging should be used to tackle juvenile offenders in a cost effective way.
• Fine Gael recognises that the increasing levels of alcohol-fuelled crime requires radical action.
• We propose to introduce electronic tagging initially for juvenile offenders and also sex offenders on release.

There are significant advantages in adopting such a measure:
• It is a cost effective way of dealing with certain crimes. At a cost of approximately €4,000 per offender, tagging costs a small fraction of the cost of sending a person to jail.
• Tagging will relieve the kind of pressure on prisons that gives rise to early release of offenders. This would ultimately ensure that prison places are available for serious offenders and will ensure that they serve their full sentences.
• Tagging increases the possibility of improving rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.
• Electronic monitoring may enable more offenders to maintain employment and contact with their families.

The most compelling argument to support the use of tagging is that of the 67,000 prisoners released under the system since it was introduced in the UK in 1999 – less than 3% have re-offended.

Fine Gael supports a total ban on all alcohol advertising, sponsorship and promotion. We will insist on installation of CCTV cameras inside and outside all nightclubs.

Crime Prevention Councils
• Fine Gael proposes that Local Authorities should coordinate an integrated approach to all issues involved in policing, crime prevention and all relevant social matters. Through the creation of Local Crime Prevention Councils, we would create an entirely new overseer role for the Local Authority.
• These councils will be established on a statutory basis and would compel senior Gardaí and other agencies to attend these public meetings. The goal would be to provide for interaction and restore a sense of cooperation and ownership to a public who has become disconnected with our criminal justice system. It would also allow the Gardaí and other groups to challenge Government on issues of relevance to them.
• Through their local elected representatives, the people will link directly to the Gardaí in their locality, encouraging community participation and helping to find the best ways to beat crime.

Community Policing
• Fine Gael will also introduce Civic Wardens to supplement and support the work of the Gardaí. The scheme would be based on the programme introduced by the Dutch Government which subsidised the recruitment of "social caretakers" to exercise functional surveillance in certain high-risk neighbourhoods.
• We want to consult with well-established and valued voluntary and community organisations such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch in establishing the Service. Suitable training should be provided and widespread consultation should be initiated with the Gardaí and local community groups prior to the launch of the scheme.
• In rural areas, the Wardens could regularly check on elderly people living alone who might be at risk from criminals. We believe it should be possible with suitable training to utilise the Community Employment Programme as the vehicle to employ these wardens.

Estate Management
• A crackdown on anti-social behaviour through a review of estate management arrangements will be undertaken by every Local Authority to protect responsible citizens from the recklessness of others.

3. Tackling Rip-Off Ireland

Issue:
Ireland, once one of the cheapest countries in the European Union, has become one of the most expensive places in the world to live. From the price of a home to the price of a hi-fi, Irish consumers are being ripped off every day. High prices are bad for everyone- bad for businesses whose costs are continually being driven up and bad for consumers who find their budget is stretched further and further.

Stance:
Fine Gael at national level has led a campaign to highlight Rip-off Ireland, particularly through our website ripoff.ie. Fine Gael believes that Local Authorities have a role to play in tackling the rip off culture. Local monopolies and cartels have emerged so even if consumers shop around they are faced with uniformly high prices in their locality.

Proposals:

Fine Gael proposes that a new Consumer Rights Enforcer be established who will:
• Conduct regular price surveys that highlight good value and name and shame those charging excessive prices.
• Create a price league website with tables on all major products.
• Develop codes of conduct for service providers and retailers on issues like passing on exchange rate movements.
• Devise and promote a Good Practice Provider quality mark for suppliers of goods and services that agree to be bound by relevant codes of practice.
• Impose fines for non display of price lists in petrol stations, pubs, hairdressers and restaurants up to a maximum of €3,000, from the current level of €127.
• Represent the consumer in national partnership agreements. It is clear that recent agreements have been dominated by the producers with consumers being given little thought.
• The Enforcer will empower Officers of Local Authorities with similar functions at local level. This will involve Local Authorities in carrying out regular local price surveys and sporadic investigations, as well as “name and shame” publicity campaigns to highlight blatant high margins on certain products.
• End rip-off practices in housing.
• Fine Gael will introduce legislation to prevent gazumping which can leave housebuyers significantly out of pocket in terms of legal fees and surveys, not to mention losing a house unfairly after a deal has been agreed.
• Many consumers throughout Ireland are being ripped-off when they buy new homes on an estate, with the builder insisting that up to 90% of the cost is paid before the house is handed over. The only party which benefits from staged payments is the builder. The consumer, however, could face financial ruin if the builder becomes bankrupt during the transaction. Fine Gael has already published a Bill to end staged payments, and the Party is demanding that they be made illegal.
• The cost of insurance to Irish consumers has more than trebled in the last three years. Young motorists are being driven off the road. Small businesses are threatened with closure because of soaring public liability insurance costs. Fine Gael is committed to the creation of one insurance market for all of Europe, thus fostering competition and driving insurance costs down.

Irish consumers are being ripped off every day. High prices are bad for everyone - bad for businesses and bad for consumers.

4. Reducing Traffic Gridlock

Issue:

Ireland’s cities and towns are struggling to deal with the traffic volumes that pass through their streets every day. Increasingly, at peak times, the main arteries into urban areas resemble car parks as commuters try to get to and from work.

The effects of this traffic chaos can be felt everywhere. The quality of people’s lives is significantly affected when they are forced to spend less time with their families and more time in their cars. Traffic gridlock is costing businesses millions. For many, there is simply no alternative to private cars.

Stance:

Ireland’s transport policies have been damned for years by short term planning, poor co-ordination and insufficient investment.

Park and Ride
• We propose the introduction of park-and-ride facilities at strategic locations where the national road network meets the public transport network, especially at rail stations and adjacent to Quality Bus Corridors. We also pledge to extend all QBCs in all urban areas. QBCs will encourage commuters to leave their cars outside city and town centres, thus reducing traffic volume and making cities and towns better places to live and work.
• Funded by the revenue generated from parking fees, Local Authorities will be charged with ensuring that park and ride facilities are properly maintained, advertised and signposted, as well as ensuring that proper access to the site is provided for in the planning stages.
• With the establishment of more park and ride facilities, demand for quality bus corridors will grow. We also expect an increase in the need for reliable, quality suburban rail services. In the short to medium term, Fine Gael sees these areas as the priority for public transport improvements throughout the country.

Better Public Transport - More Competition
• Access to the provision of bus services for reward should be opened up to private enterprise subject to suitable licensing and quality arrangements.
• Local Authorities are best placed to decide on the licensing of local bus routes, as they can properly assess consumer demand on ground level. Therefore, we recommend that powers to license local bus routes should be transferred to councils.

Dublin Transport
• Fine Gael will establish a new Dublin Transport Authority to take over the existing powers from the 20 separate groups/agencies that currently have some responsibility for transport. All public transport bodies would be answerable to the DTA for the service they provide.

An End to Roadworks Chaos
• The investment of scarce resources in the development of roads and footpaths is often reversed by service providers digging up those same roads and footpaths within a short time.
• Local Authorities must:
• Enforce the necessary regulations to ensure that public utilities (water service providers, telecommunication companies, energy supply companies are obliged to put all services underground in urban areas and in any other areas designated by the competent Planning Authorities.
• Give notice of all schedules of routine installation and maintenance work and of planned development work. This will mean that the competent Planning Authorities can ensure co-ordination of the necessary work with the minimum inconvenience to the public.
• Carry out all surface restoration work to acceptably high standards to ensure the harmony of the streetscape and to avoid danger to the public.
• Enforcement of planning laws by the Local Authorities is poor and the lax enforcement of planning conditions is common place. Therefore, Local Authorities need more and better qualified personnel to monitor the enforcement of planning conditions and a new cultural commitment to excellence must be implanted and nurtured among Local Authority staff.

Rail
• Fine Gael is committed to investing in commuter rail services, not just in the Greater Dublin area but also in regions of the country where there are under-utilised rail facilities, eg the Western Rail Corridor.

Country Roads
• Fine Gael believes that we need to seriously address the state of county roads which are in a deplorable condition in many parts of the country. Some communities are in danger of losing essential services like school bus transport and business deliveries because local roads are in such an appalling condition.
• The County Roads Refurbishment Programme has not been implemented adequately to deal with the extent of the problem and must be done so immediately.

5. Reforming Local Government

Issue:
With falling voter turnout and irrefutable evidence that people are becoming apathetic towards local politics, Fine Gael believes it is time to totally change the way Local Authorities do their work.
At worst, Local Authorities are seen as bloated, inefficient and irrelevant to the lives of people.
It doesn’t have to be this way.

Stance:
Local Government has the potential to thrive. Real local democracy, driven by the need for first class services in everything from bin collection to tax collection, can be an engine for change and improve the everyday lives of Irish people in a tangible way.

Proposals:
Directly Elected Mayors and Local Ministers for major cities
• Fine Gael believes that the concept of directly elected mayors should be piloted in the country’s major cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.
• A Mayor would be elected for a five year term by popular vote under the PR-STV system. Upon his or her election, a Local Cabinet would be selected from councillors from either one single party or a coalition representing the majority on the council.
• Each member of the Local Cabinet will act as a ‘local minister’ with a portfolio for which they will take executive decisions. The Mayor would be the political leader of the community, proposing policy for approval by the Council and spearheading cross-portfolio initiatives as well as initiatives in co-operation with other local authorities.
• If the directly elected Mayor is from a different Party than that from which the Local Cabinet is drawn, a system of ‘cohabitation’ would be established, similar to that which works in France at national level.
• Under this model, a Chief Executive will replace existing City or County Officers, Executive Officers will replace Directors of Services. Chief Executives and Executive Officers will be appointed by the full council and will be directly answerable to the elected Mayor.

Improved Structures
• The Local Government Act 2001 allows a town or specific area to apply for its own Local Government system and to establish a town or area council. Many large towns like Tallaght will apply for this status.
• Left unchanged, the larger ‘breakaway’ towns will remove a huge chunk of the tax base from existing county councils and the levels of bureaucracy will increase.

Real local democracy can be an engine for change and improve the everyday lives of Irish people in a tangible way.

6. Building Better Communities

Issue:
• Fine Gael proposes that to avoid this, each county should be divided into district councils, each of which remains within the county council framework. This will avoid a splintering of local authorities and ensure that large tracts of rural Ireland are not left without an urban tax base to support them.
• These districts should be drawn along existing natural lines and with the consent of the local communities.

Such a situation will also allow for real local democracy by bringing decision making procedures closer to the people.
• Once this has been done, Fine Gael will examine the multiplicity of Local Government agencies to see if they are really necessary we will incorporate many of these bodies into the existing local government structure, thus reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency and providing local taxpayers with better value for money.

Efficiency and Value for Money
• Services provided by Local Authorities should involve personal face to face contact between the public and officials. Privacy, courtesy and the identification of the official concerned must become the norms in such contacts. There must be a Local Government Citizens Charter which will set out clearly
• The rights of the citizen in all dealings with Local Government;
• The duties and functions of the Local Authority;
• The obligations of the Local Authority to each citizen in its functional area;
• Standards and services to be guaranteed in the system.
• Fine Gael proposes that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will annually collate and publish data, in league table format, of how each council is performing in a wide range of services. Public scrutiny, and pressure from the local communities that they are elected and paid to serve, will ensure that local authorities don’t waste money and that they provide the services people deserve.

Across the country housing estates are being built with no social infrastructure to enable the development of a sense of community. No playgrounds or parks; no schools for miles; no community halls. People are marooned in these concrete jungles with no heart in which to build a community. It’s time for something better.

Stance:

Fine Gael believes in the importance of having vibrant and sustainable residential communities. Fine Gael wants to ensure that people can feel safe where they live, go to school where they live, play sport where they live. We will promote world-class standards for the planning of residential communities and implement these standards at development stage.

Proposals:
• Fine Gael proposes to tackle the scandal of unfinished housing estates by strengthening the enforcement role of Local Authorities. Local Councils are currently hampered by a lack of personnel and resources. Fine Gael will bring forward proposals to ensure that all legal transactions between purchasers and developers include a clause whereby a portion of the price of a house is placed in trust until all elements of the development are complete.
• Fine Gael proposes the implementation of a ban on future planning permission being granted to those developers who have failed to fully comply with previous planning permissions.
• Fine Gael proposes a crackdown on anti-social behaviour through a review of estate management arrangements to be undertaken by every Local Authority to protect responsible citizens from the recklessness of others.
• Fine Gael proposes the establishment of a Built Environment Institute.
• The Institute would bring together architects, planners, sociologists, engineers, economists etc.
• The Institute should take over the work of the Building Regulations Advisory Board and will also commission research and draft guidelines on improved architectural and environmental standards for building and urban design in Ireland and in particular on the improved planning and development of residential communities.
• As part of their Housing Strategy, Fine Gael proposes that all local authorities shall be required (in partnership with the Built Environment Institute) to prepare a Charter for Development of Residential Communities.
• This charter will lay down minimum standards of architecture & urban design for new residential developments as well as guiding the provision of community facilities and social infrastructure for new or expanding residential communities.
• Fine Gael propose that developers of residential communities shall be required to provide social infrastructure for that community, including the provision of green areas, playgrounds, playing fields, community halls etc.
• Provision of social infrastructure could be achieved either in partnership with the Local Authority or directly by the developer who should be permitted to offset the relevant financial contribution against the cost of development levies applicable to that residential development.
• The proposed new National Housing Agency & Built Environment Institute would liase with Local Authorities so as to ensure that transport, educational and recreational needs can be planned and met in tandem with local accommodation provision
• Furthermore Local Authorities would be required to work with the National Housing Agency to prepare an annual report identifying residential communities that do not have adequate local access in terms of their population to schools, social services or sporting/cultural amenities.

7. Better Planning

Issue:
Economic development, increasing urbanisation and population increases have placed enormous pressures on our planning system. The planning system must be adapted to meet with these pressures in an effective way. It must also be free from the corrupt practices which have been revealed at the Planning Tribunal.

Stance:
Fine Gael believes that the planning system must be reformed so that there is greater accountability and responsiveness to the needs of a developing society.

Proposals:
Accountability
• The elected members of Local Authorities must have a far greater input into the planning process but, at the same time, be democratically accountable.
• In addition to having powers in relation to the adoption of County Development Plans, Councillors must be given the powers to draw up the regulations and guidelines necessary to implement the provisions of development plans;
• Planning decisions of certain types or over a certain threshold should be submitted for finalisation to elected members of the Planning Authority. Such decisions could include, for example, housing developments of over 50 dwelling units, retail developments over a certain size, industrial activities requiring an EPA licence and major infrastructure projects (including all National Road Authority projects).
• Fine Gael believes that any planning decision which departs from the recommendations made by technical and planning staff should be fully explained and justified to the elected members of the Planning Authority and to the public.

An Bord Pleanala
• An Bord Pleanala has proved incapable of dealing with appeals coming before it within the target maximum period. We believe that period should be reduced even further. It is clear that further resources are needed to prevent appeals from becoming an unnecessary delay in the planning and development process.
• In cases where An Bord Pleanala makes a decision that goes against the advice of its own technical advisors, the motivation of that decision should be fully explained to all interested parties and to the public. Independence does not eliminate accountability.

Rezoning Review Board
• In tandem with this approach, Fine Gael believes in the need for reform in the way rezoning decisions are made so that corruption can no longer be allowed to flourish.
• We believe that a Rezoning Review Board, headed by a High Court judge, should be established that would see every rezoning decision made at Council level scrutinised to ensure the decision is sensible and is in the public good.

Fine Gael wants to ensure that people can feel safe where they live, go to school where they live, play sport where they live.

8. Waste and Water Quality

Issue:
• If the Review Board feels that it is not, the decision will be returned to the Council where it must have to have the backing of 75% of councillors in order to be declared valid.

People with Disabilities
• Current building regulations provide for the access needs of people with disabilities. The implementation of these regulations by Planning Authorities is not being monitored or enforced adequately. Planning Authorities must ensure the implementation of these regulations and standards which meet the needs of people with disabilities in all planning matters (for example, door widths, ramp widths, ramp angles, lift sizes, unobstructed footpath widths).
• Fine Gael will work at council level to adopt and implement the Barcelona Declaration in full. The Declaration, signed in 1995, obliges the Local Authorities to:
• Promote disability awareness and ensure the rights of people with disabilities to be different and their right to receive personal attention.
• Develop policies and an equality/disability proofed decision-making process.
• Develop consultative processes.
• Provide access for people with disabilities to the social and physical environments as well as services.
• Provide training programmes dealing with equality/disability issues.
• Develop monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment procedures for actions, projects and policies regarding equality/disability issues.

FastTracking
• There is a need for outline planning frameworks that provide a fast track for industrial and commercial development (while respecting the demands of sustainable development). Planning Authorities must be given the power to designate areas for particular types of development, specifying clearly the conditions that apply to such developments. They should also be able to institute rapid response monitoring and supervision procedures, thereby make the planning and approval process both more transparent and less time consuming. Where appropriate, the Environmental Protection Agency should be involved from the beginning in the designation process.
• The Environmental Protection Agency must get all the resources, necessary to carry out its mandate to the full.

Household and commercial waste in Ireland has increased by over 60% in the five years to 2002 (source; EPA). That means on average, every man, woman and child generates 600 kilogrammes in waste every year. In Ireland 2.7m tonnes of household and commercial waste was generated in 2001- an increase of 46% in six years.

Simultaneously, our record on recycling is, by European standard, deplorable. We recycle less than 8% of our household waste, compared to 46% in Austria, 44% in Holland, 40% in Belgium and 30% in Denmark.

Already our landfill is at 86% capacity.

Stance:
If we are serious about tackling the waste crisis, we need to think local and aim high.

Proposals: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
• Fine Gael believes it is time to look to our European neighbours - and the great success of Galway City Council has had in reaching a situation where nearly half its household waste is recycled- and set a target of 50% recycling of household waste by 2008. At the moment, householders in Galway are provided with brown, green and grey wheelie bins, bring banks and bring centres designed to empower householders to separate and recycle waste. It is imperative that this infrastructure is extended nationwide. With such a target achieved, the savings to the State will be enormous, both in terms of the financial costs involved in dealing with the current levels of waste, and in terms of the environment around us.
• This initiative will cost money - Ireland at present does not have the necessary recycling infrastructure to deal with the volumes of waste involved. That is why, in order to partly fund such a measure, we propose a doubling of the Plastic Bag Levy (which will raise €12m) and a special tax on excessive packaging in order to provide local authorities with the necessary resources to turn our goal into a reality.

Investment in Water Quality
• Improve grants for group sewerage schemes to the same level available for group water schemes. This will facilitate the prioritisation of infrastructural development and the provision of services in order to aid housing development in towns and villages outside the main population centres.
• We need a greater investment in sewage services and waste water treatment throughout the country. It should be a clear policy objective that all waste water treatment should be brought to the point where waste water can be returned to the Ecosystem without causing any risk to the environment or to human health.

Septic Tanks
• Fine Gael will establish a grant scheme to upgrade septic tanks in rural areas through the installation of modern treatment systems. Priority will be given to vulnerable areas where existing tanks are causing a serious threat to public health and the environment. Consideration will be given to providing an enhanced grant for group sewerage schemes where the increased grant will make such schemes viable in these prioritised areas. Over a five-year period in Government, we will eradicate the potential for pollution from non-functioning septic tanks.

9. Protecting Agriculture

Issue: Following the Mid-Term Review Agreement many farmers are examining how the proposals will impact upon them and how best to move forward.

Stance: Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the family farm remains a viable option and all policy decisions taken should assist this aim.

Policy must assist production and it must also recognise the fact that we have to work towards a product with a competitive advantage that has a market outlet. Some groups such as dairying are set to face major changes following the Mid-Term Review and others are almost certain to lose out, for example farm retirement groups and farmers who sold on calves. Fine Gael is committed to examining how these groups will ultimately be affected and to enacting measures to assist them.

Proposals:
• Live animal trade – Fine Gael recognises the importance of the live animal trade to the agriculture industry, and has raised its concerns with the EU Commissioner. Fine Gael will press to ensure that EU proposals for reform of the live trade will include the inclusion of staging posts and that any proposals will not have a negative impact on the industry.
• Nitrates directive – Fine Gael recognises the need to protect and improve our water quality. The implementation of the directive must be based on scientific fact and that no unnecessary burden will be placed on farm practices. Fine Gael will ensure that adequate funding is provided for the development works required for storage and that the necessary derogations required in advance of this are obtained.
• Farm partnerships – Fine Gael will examine all necessary regulations to ensure that farmers, who so desire, can enter into partnerships to improve efficiency, without suffering any penalties. This will be encouraged in all farming sectors.
• Animal breeding – Fine Gael will promote quality breeding in the suckler herd and will establish a programme of breeding improvement in conjunction with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation.
• Food Standards Authority – Fine Gael will extend the role and functions of the Food Safety Authority to encompass Food Standards to ensure that Irish produced foodstuffs can gain a competitive advantage, by improving quality and labelling.
• Food labelling – We will seek changes in EU Labelling Policy to ensure that the consumer knows what they are eating and to cease the practice of non-EU foodstuffs being passed off as home produce.
• Fine Gael will tackle the rip-off that sees consumers paying high food prices while farmers are not getting the benefit. In the last seven years, food prices have risen by 26%, but farm gate prices have hardly risen at all. A Fine Gael survey into the rip-off revealed that the average mark-up between the price paid to the farmer and the price paid by the consumer is 119%.

Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the family farm remains a viable option.

10. Education

Issue:
Today, the educational potential of our children and young people is being squandered. Unsuitable school buildings, inadequate sporting and science facilities and the lack of assistance for children with special needs all contribute to the problem.

Stance:
Fine Gael’s commitment to education means that we are focussed on supporting education at every level, at every age and at every ability. This means working with parents and students, schools and teachers, to keep children in school, and to give them the help that they require to reach their full potential.

Proposals:
• Educational psychologists: Access to an educational psychologist can make a huge difference to a child with special needs. However, with a quarter of schools waiting more than nine months for access to a psychologist for their students, it is clear that many children are not being given the help they require. Fine Gael will radically expand the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), and believes that children who need a psychological assessment should have a statutory right to that assessment within 6 weeks of their referral.
• Vetting: Child safety at school must be prioritised. Fine Gael believes that people who have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults should be vetted before taking up employment. This means that teachers and all other staff at schools should be vetted.
• National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB): The NEWB was set up in July 2002 to help students to stay in school. The Board needs 300 Education Welfare Officers to provide a full service to schools, but to date has less than one third of that number. If we catch children before they drop out of school, and give them the assistance that they need to reach their potential in the classroom, then we are giving them the best possible assistance on the road towards a successful and fulfilling life. Fine Gael will support the expansion of the NEWB so that all schools in the country will have access to its services.
• Special Educational Resources: Thousands of children are being left waiting for badly needed special educational resources because of delays in dealing with applications for assistance caused by a critical administrative bottleneck in the Department of Education.
• Vocational Educational Committees (VECs): VECs and local development partnerships should be funded and supported in the establishment of homework and breakfast clubs, particularly in areas of disadvantage in their communities.
• The support of parents should be enlisted in these initiatives. The home environment can be critical to keeping children in school for longer, and with a more successful outcome. Parents should be encouraged to become involved in the education and achievement of their children.
• Youthreach and Traveller Education: Fine Gael believes that there should be a radical expansion of Youthreach and Traveller Education programmes.
• Childcare services: Funding to VECs and to local development partnerships to provide childcare services to young parents still in school, or attending early school leaver or second chance education programmes should be restored and enhanced so that more young parents can stay in education.
• Mediation: A local education mediation service, working in conjunction with the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) should be developed to track all children from age 14 years onwards who are at risk of early school leaving. This service will involve counselling, mentoring, appropriate placement and aftercare.
• Fine Gael remains opposed to the reintroduction of third level fees.

11. Better Health

Issue:
There is huge concern throughout Ireland about access to health services, particularly A&E services. The Taoiseach has promised ‘medical cover’ in all hospitals. However, in Hanly speak ‘medical cover’ means having a nurse on duty and a doctor at the end of a telephone.

As a nation, we are facing epidemics in conditions such as asthma and diabetes. Both of these conditions respond well to early and regular treatment. Barriers to early intervention cause complications and exacerbations which, in turn, place further pressure on hospitals and cost the health service millions each year.

More than 450 people take their own lives each year and in excess of 10,000 report to Accident and Emergency having self-harmed. This is an issue which has been ignored for too long.

High medical inflation and a failure to increase the medical card threshold discourage many on an average age from seeking early medical intervention.

Stance:
Fine Gael has made it crystal clear that it is opposed to the closure of vital A&E services in local hospitals. It is not equitable, it is not safe and it is not acceptable. Fine Gael believes that a hospital is not a hospital unless it has a doctor on-site 24 hours a day. We are committed to ensuring that at a minimum every hospital has such a service. Vital though hospitals are, we must also focus on helping people to stay healthy and to support primary care interventions. This approach would help to relieve pressure on the overburdened hospital service.

Proposals:
Fine Gael’s health priorities for Local Government are:
• Major investment in additional acute hospital beds and additional consultants to ensure a timely, high quality service for patients
• Fine Gael favours a major investment in primary health services (such as GPs, community pharmacies, community nursing etc). This will take pressure off secondary services (hospitals). It will facilitate a new approach to health service provision, which includes greater emphasis on preventive care and on citizens taking responsibility.
• The implementation of public health policies across all Government Departments aimed at tackling preventable illnesses and keeping people out of hospital.
• Raising the threshold for medical card eligibility so that people on low incomes will be have better access to primary care.
• Introducing clear, systematic programmes aimed at the prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour. We will implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the National Taskforce on Suicide and we will increase funding for research into suicide and suicidal behaviour.
• Dramatically improving the provision of mental health services. We will introduce a community Early Intervention Service (EIS) to provide a rapid response service for patients with severe mental illness.
• Ensuring effective mechanisms of accountability in any revised Health Board structures so that health services are meeting local needs.
• Appointing a Health Ombudsman to ensure that citizens have recourse to independent information and adjudication of practice and procedure. This would be achieved by creating a Covenant of Rights and Responsibilities for Patients, which would be overseen by the Ombudsman.
• Establishing an office of Surgeon General whose objective is to ensure that health services are not the preserve of vested interests, either political, bureaucratic or medical. The Surgeon General would report directly to Dáil Éireann and work with the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to achieve that objective.
• 6,000-7,000 people die annually from sudden cardiac arrest in Ireland. Fine Gael will actively promote the locating of defibrillators in communities and the training of personnel to use them. In addition Fine Gael will include a provision in development plans, placing a requirement on major commercial developments attracting large numbers of people to provide defibrillator facilities on site.

We must focus on helping people to stay healthy.

12. The Elderly

Issue:
Services for older people in Ireland fall far short of an adequate standard. They are characterised by huge gaps in services, by queues and waiting lists, and by unaffordable costs.

Changes in society have eroded traditional support structures for older people but we have failed to develop proper replacements

The health shortages have been particularly severe on older people. No adequate preventative health strategy has been developed to manage the problems of older age and the crisis conditions in Casualty Departments have acutely affected older people. It is commonplace to encounter long waits on trolleys for attention, untimely discharge to settings without care support, and dispatch to long stay residence instead of rehabilitation that would prolong independence. Ireland has a unique opportunity at the present time with high-income growth and low dependency ratios to lay the foundations for high quality policies for a fulfilled and secure old age.

Stance:
Fine Gael will develop its policy for advancing years based on key overriding objectives:
• To promote active retirement
• To integrate services so that people's needs can be anticipated instead of reacting only to crisis
• To guarantee timely access to care
• To give priority to intervention and care settings which can support the independence of the person in their community
• To guarantee high standards in all services

Proposals:

Active Retirement Fine Gael is determined to expand the scope for an active retirement. Specific proposals include:
• Persons who continue to work after their retirement age will be allowed invest tax free a certain amount each year in a security fund for later use.
• A quota of lottery funds for active retirement programmes and modules will be put in place.
• Improved travel options will include the removal of the peak hour ban for those attending hospital appointments and the development of agreements with other EU States to allow older people avail of travel concessions when overseas.

Facilitating Older People to remain Living Independently Minor adaptations to the home can often enable older people to remain at home with greater independence and a sense of security. No older person should be denied such facilities because they cannot afford them. Among the measures which we propose are:
• Home Subvention Schemes to empower older people to buy in services they feel they need from whatever source they prefer.
• Budgets for maintenance, insulation and essential repair and appliances will be substantially enhanced.
• Adaptations costing less than €3,800 will only need to be certified by the local GP.
• Support for security measures and social monitoring will be improved and the Community Welfare Officer will be given specific responsibility for its development.

Timely Access to Health Care Fine Gael proposes:
• Systematic investment to fill the gaps in acute care and rehabilitation.
• Prioritisation of treatments such as hip replacement, knee replacement, cataract operations and heart bypasses which maintain independence, to secure an acceptable waiting time.
• Protocols that fast track emergency older patients presenting at Casualty Departments.
• A proper discharge plan to support people as they settle back into their homes after a period of acute care.

Access to Residential Care on Fair Terms when necessary Access to long-stay residential care is highly arbitrary, inequitable and lacks transparency. Fine Gael is currently looking at new and equitable proposals for funding the long term care of the elderly.

Fine Gael wants reforms to the Nursing home subvention scheme which are based on the actual cost of care and leave a reasonable amount for personal comfort for the patient. It is essential that we guarantee to meet long-term costs where assets have become exhausted.

Fine Gael will also put in place:
• An independent system for vetting the standards of all long stay care facilities.
• A Register of facilities and of vacancies will be developed and act as a Clearing House so that the search for suitable long stay accommodation will become easier.

13. Supporting Families

Issue:
There is a growing recognition of the need for work/life balance and for measures that support the modern family. Many families now have two parents at work and they must juggle the needs of their children with the demands of their career or their education. Some parents have both childcare and elder care responsibilities at the same time.

The number of parents raising their children alone has risen. Employment rates among lone parents are low. Childcare training, education and other supports are necessary to allow them access work and to support their families.

Stance:
Fine Gael believes that it is possible to have a society which values and supports childhood and the family and to have public policies which enhance that value and support.

Proposals:
Addressing the Needs of the Modern Family Fine Gael proposes the institution of a Biennial National Conference on the Family, sponsored by Government, to focus on the impact of public policy on the family. The themes for such Conferences would include:

• Examination of Social Welfare and taxation as they impact on families.
• Parenting and childcare.
• Reform of Employment law to allow for family-friendly work practices issues.
• Co-ordinate efforts to support joint parenting, child and elder care and support for families experiencing difficulties.
• Review and refine current policy.

Family Friendly Work Practice We propose:
• To embed part-time work in career patterns.
• To increase workplace flexibility for both parents including part time and flexi-time work, personalised hours, job sharing, teleworking and term-time work.
• Reviewing Labour Law to recognise the changes needed to accommodate a situation where both parents work and share in the obligations of parenting and incentivise employers to assist the development of family friendly work practices.

Childcare Fine Gael supports the work being done by County Childcare Committees and we will ensure that they receive adequate funding and support to carry out their vital role.

We propose:
• To double the home carers tax credit to assist those people who choose to stay at home to care for their children or the elderly and increase the income disregard threshold to ensure that home carers qualify for a tax credit equivalent to the PAYE credit,
• After-hours use of school premises for childcare and the development of innovative after-school options,
• To introduce new guidelines for local authorities to facilitate planning for new childcare facilities, which meet certain basic criteria,
• To guarantee quality by agreeing national training standards for early care and education

Recreation and Play We will:
• Champion the further development of children’s play and recreation facilities in all areas, and ensure that each community is a safe, child friendly living environment.
• Work with Local Authorities in the preparation of a local play policy in consultation with children and other stakeholders.
• Invest in the development of footpaths, cycle ways and traffic calming measures
• Support the allocation of the funding required to develop play facilities in disadvantaged communities from the development levies imposed under the Planning and Development Act 2000, and ensure that the facilities are designed and located in areas accessible to children living in poverty and social exclusion.
• Prioritise community recreation facilities to provide positive recreational opportunities within local development strategies and plans.

14. Carers

Issue:
Many carers are isolated and struggling on their own to cope. Voluntary organisations are facing a decline in the number of volunteers. State support is at best patchy and at worst totally absent. Many carers themselves suffer health problems because of the stresses of coping alone. Community and voluntary groups help where they can, but many face funding problems.

Stance:
Fine Gael values and respects the wonderful work of carers. We aim to create a society which asks carers not what they have but what they need. Less than half of full time carers receive any financial support from the State. Fine Gael is determined to develop a New Deal for Carers.

Proposals:
Our proposals include:
• Raising the income disregard for the carer's allowance.
• Paying half rate carer's allowance to those carers who are already in receipt of social welfare benefits.
• Putting in place a minimum guarantee of two weeks respite care for all full time carers.

In the longer term our objectives are to remove the means test altogether from those providing continuous care to persons with high care requirements, and to give the person with a disability more flexibility to arrange the type of care requirement that best suit their needs. As a first step towards these objectives we will introduce a ‘Continuous Care Grant’ which will not be means tested and will be related to care needs and will be paid directly to the disabled person.
