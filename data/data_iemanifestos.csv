Keeping Ireland competitive

Europe Matters because it has played a central role in fostering the prosperity of Ireland since we joined in 1973. Our economy has benefited immensely from the European Single Market and from the unprecedented levels of foreign direct investment, which stems from our EU membership. As a nation we must never take this for granted and must always work to preserve our prosperity and competitiveness.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Defend Irish tax sovereignty.

• Ensure a fair and effective EU Budget.

• Create a common market for insurance.

• Complete the banking union.

• Support mutually beneficial trade deals.

• Address youth unemployment.

• Develop youth entrepreneurship.

• Protect the right to use cash.

Defend Irish tax sovereignty Ireland has played a leading role in establishing the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion Profits Shifting at the OECD and will continue to ensure companies pay the tax rate set by our State. Fianna Fáil MEPs, as they have done in the past, will oppose any efforts by other MEPs to attack Ireland’s reputation. We will continue to oppose any erosion of Member State competency in tax and ensure companies in Ireland have tax planning certainty at an internationally competitive rate.

Ensure a fair and effective EU Budget The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) sets out the financial priorities of the EU. The European Parliament has a central role in confirming the MFF, to which Ireland is now a net contributor. Fianna Fáil MEPs will ensure that Ireland receives adequate funding to advance our economy and society. We will support additional payments from Ireland only if our priorities, upholding of the Rule of Law and commitment to the green and digital revolutions, are protected and advanced.

Create a common market for insurance Fianna Fáil believes that the EU can play a role in fostering more competition to help drive down costs. EU wide data sharing, standardised monitoring and regulations should be rolled out to encourage more companies into the Irish insurance market, which should reduce consumer costs.

Complete the banking union Mortgage rates in Ireland can be up to double the Eurozone average. Fianna Fáil will promote the completion of the banking union to facilitate cross-border services and foster competition in the Irish banking market, which will benefit Irish customers by cutting costs and providing more competitive mortgage and loan rates.

Support mutually beneficial trade deals Fianna Fáil supports viable EU free trade deals. With 1.3 million Irish jobs depending on the EU’s trade links, international trade is vital for our small, open economy. Trade agreements are the EU’s main lever for influence with third countries in terms of climate action, human rights and democratic reform. Any free trade agreements should uphold European quality standards in sustainability, food safety and labour rights. Trade deals should also benefit SMEs, not just large corporations.

Address youth unemployment The effects of youth unemployment are far reaching, with the impact on income continuing over a lifetime. Fianna Fáil believes that all EU Member States must implement the reinforced Youth Guarantee. We will identify key apprenticeship opportunities in Member States and enable young people to access them through the ERAMUS+ programme, particularly where there are insufficient opportunities in their home country.

Develop youth entrepreneurship.

Young people launching a start-up or taking over a family business must be provided with opportunities and training, as well as facilitated access to finance. Technical assistance provided by the EU for stimulating the digital and green transition should prioritise young entrepreneurs. Fianna Fáil supports the creation of a one-stop-shop in each Member State for young entrepreneurs that would provide information on how to start your own business and how to apply for EU funding. We believe more funding should be allocated to Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme.

Protect the right to use cash Fianna Fáil believes that access to cash, and the right to use it in society, must be protected. We will support changes to EU regulation that protects the right to use cash in key sectors such as utilities, medical and pharmaceutical suppliers and in the grocery sector.

Advancing Irish priorities in Europe

Europe Matters for Ireland. Ireland has always promoted the values of equality, diversity and cooperation with other nations. These values allowed us to seize the opportunities of EU membership and transform our society. Guided by these values, we will continue to advance Ireland’s place at the heart of the EU.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland.

• Maintain Ireland’s military neutrality.

• Put Irish citizens at the heart of EU decision making.

• Cement the status of the Irish language in Europe.

• Attract new EU agencies to Ireland.

• Secure geographical protection for Irish craft products.

Preserve peace in Northern Ireland The EU is a key guarantor of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. Fianna Fáil will continue to engage with EU partners to properly implement the Windsor Framework and the Protocol on Northern Ireland, facilitate all-island trade and to ensure that we never return to a hard border. As prosperity is vital in safeguarding peace, we will ensure that EU PEACE PLUS funding, which is investing €1.145 billion in Northern Ireland and the border counties, is retained.

Maintain Ireland’s military neutrality Fianna Fáil is proud of Ireland’s tradition of military neutrality which is characterised by non-membership of military alliances or common mutual defence arrangements. We will preserve our neutrality while we work towards peace support operations and crisis management development through the United Nations and the European Union. We will ensure that any involvement Ireland has with the European Defence and/or PESCO is guided by our policy of military neutrality.

Put Irish citizens at the heart of EU decision making Ireland has a proud record of service in the EU institutions, which we must build upon. Fianna Fáil will promote information on EU job opportunities in universities. We will promote secondments from the Irish public service to EU institutions to encourage exchange of expertise and to ensure that Irish voices are heard at all levels of EU decision-making.

Cement the status of the Irish language in Europe The Irish language is a distinct thread in the rich cultural fabric of Europe. We will seek additional EU support for Erasmus Gaeltachta, which gives third-level students the opportunity to spend a semester with Gaeltacht families.

Attract new EU agencies to Ireland With the digital revolution, it is expected that a number of new EU agencies will be required. Ireland’s geographic position as the gateway to Europe, our expertise in tech services and our highly educated workforce will allow Fianna Fáil MEPs to make a strong case for Ireland as the location for the proposed EU AI Office or any other new agencies.

Secure geographical protection for Irish traditional craftwork Fianna Fáil fully supports EU efforts to protect the geographical indication of Irish products. For example, Donegal tweed can and should be among the first products to receive this protection to prevent producers, who are not located in Donegal and/ or not using Donegal wool, from marketing their product as Donegal tweed. This will safeguard Irish jobs and ensure that only authentic, high-quality products are sold, thereby upholding the craft’s global reputation.

Building a fair and firm migration process

Europe Matters in managing migration flows and upholding a fair, rules-based system. The challenges presented by migration cannot be effectively addressed by any one state acting alone in a globalised and interdependent world. We need a coherent approach, fit for the 21st century, across the EU to migration, asylum, integration and border management.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Enter the EU Migration and Asylum Pact.

• Step up cooperation with third states.

• Invest in communities hosting asylum seekers.

Enter the EU Migration and Asylum Pact We need a fair, rules-based immigration system, which respects both the integrity of our EU borders and the dignity of people trying to access better lives in Europe. This is reflected in the new Migration and Asylum Pact. Under the pact, applications for asylum will be quickly assessed at the EU’s external border, to determine if such an application is admissible or not. There will be tight timelines to allow for faster decisions. Those who are not entitled to asylum will be returned home swiftly, allowing those in need of asylum to access protection without undue delay.

The Pact introduces mandatory solidarity for Member States ensuring equal burden sharing. States can choose relocation or financial contributions as their method of solidarity. This gives Ireland the option to provide financial assistance, rather than accept relocations. It also will allow Ireland to obtain financial assistance when needed. There is going to be at least €1.9 billion allocated by the EU to ensure that the pact works as intended.

Our MEPs will work to improve human rights safeguards in the Pact, to guarantee no arbitrary detention and will push for an EU Search and Rescue service in the Mediterranean Sea. We will also continue to encourage an EU clamp down on migrant smuggling networks who are continuously exploiting the desperation and vulnerability of migrants seeking to escape armed conflict.

Step up cooperation with third states The EU has developed tailor-made Action Plans for ten key countries in the Southern Mediterranean and the East of Europe. These Actions Plans will be key to managing irregular and forced migration and preventing people from undertaking perilous journeys.

We will continue to implement preferential trade deals with our neighbouring countries, which can boost their economies and provide employment opportunities, thereby decreasing irregular arrivals into the EU.

Invest in communities hosting asylum seekers Communities in Ireland hosting considerable numbers of asylum seekers must be supported. We will advocate for additional EU funds to invest in these communities to ensure that they have the infrastructure and services that they need.

Protecting EU Values

Europe Matters because in an increasingly volatile world, the EU fights to uphold democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These are our core values, which help us maintain a society in which pluralism, tolerance, solidarity and equality prevail.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Link EU funding to the upholding of core values.

• Combat violence against women.

• Put disability rights at the heart of EU policy.

• Deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.

Link EU funding to the upholding of core values The erosion of judicial independence, media freedoms and fair electoral processes in certain Member States is extremely concerning. This democratic backsliding cannot be tolerated. Fianna Fáil will ensure Member States who undermine these values are financially disciplined.

Equally, the provision of EU funds to Member States must be inextricably linked to the equality of treatment of all minority groups within that State. Safeguarding minority rights must be a pre-condition for EU membership, with no exception made for any candidate country.

Combat violence against women Every day, two women in the EU are killed by an intimate partner or relative. This shameful statistic lays bare the urgent need to tackle gender-based violence. Fianna Fáil will work to ensure that the Directive on Combating Violence Against Women is implemented by Member States. We will also make this directive stronger. In particular, Fianna Fáil will help to revise it to include a European definition of rape based on lack of consent, so that rape can be effectively prosecuted across borders.

Put disability rights at the heart of EU policy People with disabilities still face considerable barriers in society. At EU level, we will ensure that ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a prerequisite for accession. We will seek the speedy implementation of the EU Disability Card and an EU Parking Card for persons with disabilities. Our MEPs will also support legislation to guarantee the availability and affordability of assistive technologies for persons with disabilities.

Deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals The EU was instrumental in the development of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through which countries collectively pledged to undertake action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. We want the EU to continue to take action, both at home and around the world, by prioritising assistance to those countries who are furthest behind through development aid, international partnerships and investment in infrastructure. Fianna Fáil MEPs will continue to fully commit to the action necessary to bring about this global transformation by the 2030 deadline, ensuring no one is left behind.

Tackling climate change

Europe Matters in the fight to mitigate the climate crisis and to ensure a just transition for all. Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. Faced with the uncertain policies of the other global powers, the EU is embracing its role as the leader in climate action.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Ensure the EU meets its climate targets.

• Bring about a just transition.

• Diversify our energy supply.

• Implement an EU-wide circular economy.

• Ban green washing.

• Tackle plastic waste and microplastics.

• Create a European Blue Deal.

Ensure the EU meets its climate targets Fianna Fáil will ensure that the EU fully adheres to the Paris Agreement and meets the targets it has set: to achieve a 55% reduction in emissions relative to 1990 standards by 2030 and to fully decarbonise by 2050.

Bring about a Just Transition Certain EU regions are disproportionately impacted by the necessary shift away from carbon intensive activities. The Just Transition Fund must continue to provide for these communities. We will seek to increase the fund so that it can be used to attract new industries, finance training opportunities and support local employment initiatives.

Diversify our energy supply Europe’s over reliance on the importation of oil and gas was exposed when Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine lead to energy price hikes across the continent. The EU must reduce its supply of imported fossil fuels and move towards sustainable energy sources. The EU’s Solar Energy Strategy is part of the plan to phase out Russian fossil fuels and accelerate the green transition. Fianna Fáil supports the strategy and further cooperation at EU level, which can help us meet our national target of 8GW of solar connections by 2030.

Wind is Ireland’s most reliable energy source, saving us billions in gas imports. Fianna Fáil believes that with increased offshore wind energy production, Ireland can achieve energy independence and, in the coming decades, become a net exporter of renewable energy.

Floating offshore wind is particularly well suited for the south and west coasts of Ireland. Its development should be fast tracked. Our MEPs will ensure that floating offshore wind and other renewable energy projects, receive adequate funding and resources.

Fianna Fáil MEPs will support increased energy connectivity to continental Europe, similar to the Celtic Interconnector, to ensure we have the capacity to transport excess electricity to other markets. This will be essential if Ireland is to capitalise on the potential for cooperation on green hydrogen with Germany.

Implement an EU-wide circular economy The New Circular Economy Action Plan charts a pathway for us to move away from the linear take-make-waste model. The Plan will ensure that waste is prevented and that resources used are kept in the EU economy for as long as possible. Fianna Fáil supports the Plan and will ensure that citizens see the results, including the rollout of the common charger (USB-C) for handheld digital devices, the implementation of right to repair for common household appliances (washing machines, TVs etc), ending of the destruction of unsold clothes and textiles and the reduction in packaging waste.

Ban green washing Fianna Fáil will continue to support the European Parliament’s ambitious efforts to tackle green washing; a harmful marketing tactic whereby companies mislead consumers into believing that their products are sustainable. New legislation will ban the use of phrases like “environmentally friendly” and “eco” without sufficient proof of the product’s credentials.

Tackle plastic waste and micro-plastics The long-awaited revision of the REACH Directive will provide an opportunity to reduce micro-plastics in our environment. Fianna Fáil will focus on action to phase out the use of PFAS (forever chemicals) – our MEPs have already succeeded in banning PFAS in the manufacturing of toys and will campaign for their full elimination in the European Union.

Create a European Blue Deal Ireland’s waters are our most precious resources. They provide thousands of people with a livelihood. However, they are under threat from climate change and uncontrolled commercial activity. Fianna Fáil supports the establishment of a Blue Deal for European waters that will balance the need for economic development with environmental protection.

Strengthening our agrifood sector and rural communities

Europe Matters for our agrifood sector. Joining the EU allowed Ireland to diversify our export market and increase agricultural productivity. Now the sector faces challenges; no community is being hit harder by climate change than our farmers and the wider agrifood industry. We need our farming community and we need to work with them to enable medium and long term sustainability. Europe needs sustainable food production. New technologies, direct aid and real partnership for change is Fianna Fáil’s commitment to secure the future for Irish farming and food production. This is what we will fight for in the European Parliament.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Guarantee food security through a strong CAP budget.

• Cut red tape.

• Protect farmers’ access to the Single Market.

• Retain our nitrates derogation.

• Implement fair nature restoration measures.

• Invest in new technologies.

• Build a fair Common Fisheries Policy.

• Support rural communities.

Guarantee food security through a strong CAP budget Fianna Fáil understands that reconciling food security and action on climate change is a defining challenge of our time and that we must support farmers in this. Ireland’s agrifood sector is already amongst the most environmentally friendly in the world. Given this, and that the world population is set to increase to 10 billion people by 2050, it is crucial that countries such as Ireland, which has the capacity to grow food sustainably, is supported to do so.

The CAP budget must be significantly increased to ensure food security and to ensure that farmers are backed in terms of income for the vital service they provide. Fianna Fáil will ensure Irish family farms are supported in continuing to produce much needed food for the domestic and export market, while supporting farmers strongly to reduce the emissions footprint of how this food is produced.

Cut red tape Fianna Fáil supports the European Parliament’s work on Simplification of certain CAP rules. This review relates to soil cover during sensitive periods, crop rotation, non-productive features, targeted exemptions to allow ploughing, as well as different levels of compliance.

We must ensure that the next CAP is more simplified with a strong budget. Fianna Fáil MEPs will work to ensure that a reduction in the regulatory burden is delivered and made a reality on the ground for farmers.

Protect farmers’ access to the Single Market Irish farmers must not be prohibited from selling in the Single Market by anticompetitive measures, notably arbitrary maximum journey times for live animal exports. Our agri-sector needs to be able to export excess animals for both market and climate requirements. Fianna Fáil believes that increasing animal welfare standards, as well as protecting the ability of Ireland to export live animals can be achieved. We support increased veterinary oversight, improved technologies in the areas of climate control and feeding, as well as enhanced training for drivers.

Retain our Nitrates Derogation Our current Nitrates Derogation runs until the end of 2025. Derogation farmers undertake environmental training, implement additional water quality actions on farms and are subject to a higher level of inspection, as required under the Commission Implementing Decision granting Ireland’s Nitrates Derogation.

Fianna Fáil MEPs and candidates are absolutely committed to working in every way possible to make sure that Ireland retains its derogation. They will robustly advocate through the European Parliament the valid geographical reasons why Ireland’s derogation should be continued and the work underway at farm level to ensure the water quality improves.

Implement fair nature restoration measures Approximately 80% of habitats across the EU are substantially degraded. Fianna Fáil supports fair nature restoration measures that reward the hard work farmers are undertaking to tackle biodiversity loss that has been seen over the last generation.

Fianna Fáil policy is that landowner participation in the delivery of the EU Nature Restoration Law is voluntary. We know how committed farmers are to biodiversity and the importance of their contribution, but also recognise that it is crucial that the asks on farmers are proportionate. Fianna Fáil MEPs will support the call for farmers to be provided with strong funding, separate to CAP, to ensure that they are rewarded for Nature Restoration activity that they engage in.

As a result of interventions made by Fianna Fáil Ministers during Council negotiations on the law, the proposed law encompasses significantly altered rewetting obligations to ensure that all rewetting targets can be delivered entirely from State-owned lands well into the 2040s. Fianna Fáil policy is that the recent recalculation of the national inventory - lowering the area of drained peat grassland soils - is reflected in any national rewetting targets.

Invest in new technologies To foster an environment where farmers can thrive and seize opportunities, whilst mitigating the challenges of climate change and keeping food affordable, we must invest in breakthrough technologies. Much work is under way in the areas of fertiliser, genotyping and anaerobic digestion which should be supported by CAP.

Our MEPs will work to ensure that research projects making groundbreaking advancements in agriculture and biodiversity receive Horizon Europe research funding.

Build a fair Common Fisheries Policy Our coastal communities are reliant on an effective Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to preserve their livelihoods. The CFP must ensure the needs of the fishing industry are met, without jeopardising fish stocks for future generations. It must also provide a guaranteed income for fishermen and ensure top-quality seafood at reasonable prices for consumers. To safeguard the future of the sector, the CFP should support it in facing wider, global challenges such as the impact of climate change and the energy transition.

Our MEPs will highlight the challenges experienced by the Irish seafood sector. Fianna Fáil will also continue to fight for maximum sustainable quotas for the Irish fishing industry in the annual fixing of EU catches and quotas. The ability of Member States to share or transfer unused quotas on an annual basis must be implemented.

There needs to be a comprehensive analysis of the impact on the Member States’ fishing opportunities as a result of quota transfers under the EU–UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement. Fianna Fáil will continue to fight to ensure that the disproportionate burden of Brexit on Irish fishers is addressed at EU level.

Support rural communities The EU plays a key role in strengthening and supporting our rural communities. Our towns, coastal areas and communities have benefited from investment from European Structural and Investment Funds, CAP Funds, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) and Horizon Europe funds. Fianna Fáil will continue to advocate for investments which empower community-led local development, such as LEADER programmes, boosting rural infrastructure, social inclusion, job creation and sustainable economic development.

Establishing a European New Deal on Housing

Europe Matters because of the supporting role it can play in housing policy. Housing is a challenge for all Member States, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine and global market trends. There are currently many directives that apply to planning and given the challenges on access to funding it is important that there is a common EU approach to help our citizens access housing. We believe that the European Investment Bank should reinforce its support for Housing.

With Housing for All Fianna Fáil has doubled home building and will double it again. Ireland now has the fastest growing home building sector in the EU. Housing is a national competency, but we believe that the EU can help drive our ambitions.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Support a European New Deal on Housing.

• Establish an EU Housing Co-operation Platform.

• Tackle long-term use of Air BnB (Short-Term Lets).

• Release European Investment Bank (EIB) funding for student housing.

• Strengthen the role of the EIB in financing affordable and social housing.

Support a European New Deal on Housing Member States share common challenges with providing affordable housing. While respecting the principle of subsidiarity, Fianna Fáil will support increased cooperation on affordable housing at EU level, as well as use of EU funds, such as the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and Invest EU to tackle the housing shortage.

Establish an EU Housing Co-operation Platform An EU Housing co-operation platform should be set up to provide practical ongoing support across all levels of the provision of housing and governance. This could involve upskilling housing providers, encouraging partnerships on key housing issues and sharing best practise. The Platform would underpin EU efforts to support national and local housing policies, by simplifying access to information on EU instruments, including funding.

Tackle long term use of Air BnB Short-term let platforms like AirBnB and Booking.com are impacting the supply of long-term rental units. European compliance measures have stalled Ireland’s ability to introduce changes nationally for the past three years and these type of delays must be removed given the housing challenges. Our MEPs will ensure that tackling housing issues like short-term lets is prioritised by the Commission.

Release European Investment Bank (EIB) funding for student housing Students in the EU are struggling to find housing. This puts undue stress on students and their families. Student housing initiatives must be supported at EU level. Fianna Fáil will advocate for the use of the ESF+ to build affordable student housing.

Strengthen the role of the EIB in financing Social and Affordable Housing Fianna Fáil will advocate for the restructuring of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to offer financial tools to support social and affordable housing. This would leverage private sector funding to maximise home building.

Embracing the digital revolution

Europe Matters in the digital transition. The EU sets global standards in new and emerging technology and seeks to regulate the tech space in an ethical manner. We must continue to harness our knowledge and capacity to create a Europe fit for the digital age.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Boost research and innovation.

• Increase funding for the EU Space programme.

• Collaborate on semi-conductor production.

• Protect children from digital threats.

• Make online media safer for users.

• Implement the AI Act.

Boost research and innovation Fianna Fáil fully supports Horizon Europe, which, with a budget of €95.5 billion, funds research and innovation across the EU. In Ireland, Horizon has funded research on, amongst other areas, the microbiome, dementia and defence against cyberattacks. We believe that small companies must be supported more in applying for Horizon funding.

Increase funding for the EU Space Programme The EU Space Programme drives entrepreneurship. Fianna Fáil supports increased spending on the EU Space programme, in conjunction with further co-operation with the European Space Agency, to boost European innovation and provide opportunities for the Irish space sector.

Collaborate on semi-conductor production Semi-conductors are key components in electrical devices. Currently, most of Europe’s supply of these essential chips is imported from countries in Asia, where political instability could disrupt the export market. Fianna Fáil supports the European Commission’s aim of creating a state-of-the-art European ecosystem of chip production. Supported by the EU, Ireland can become a major player in the global chip sector; we are home to over 100 semiconductor companies, with 25,000 people employed in the sector. The sector was worth €15.5 billion to the Irish economy in 2023.

The Microelectronic Circuits Centre Ireland (MCCI) is hosted at the Tyndall National Institute in Cork. The Tyndall has called for a National Chips Strategy, with an ambitious target of more than doubling the size of the semiconductor industry in Ireland by 2030. Fianna Fáil supports this and firmly believes that we can vastly increase domestic production, reduce our reliance on imports and make Ireland the chip capital of Europe.

Protect children from digital threats Threats to the wellbeing of children from constant online activity is an urgent priority for Fianna Fáil. Working with our colleagues in the Renew Europe group, we will support initiatives from both a public health and education perspective to assist parents and schools in making the right choices. Fianna Fáil supports the banning of smartphones during school hours to provide time and space to socialise and engage offline. Our MEPs will support legislation to compel social media platforms to get underage children off their apps if they do not do so themselves.

Make online media safer for users Ireland is home to many of the world’s leading technology companies. They contribute much to our economy and their employees are an important and dynamic part of Irish society. However, Fianna Fáil believes that the sector needs robust EU regulation to prevent illegal online activity. We will continue to support and improve the EU’s Digital Services Act as it regulates dangerous online behaviour. For the protection of citizens, we will continue to enforce compliance with GDPR and domestic laws. We will also advocate for a ban on recommender system algorithms that can be used to promote self-harm, suicide and violent extremism.

Implement the AI Act Fianna Fáil supports the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive legislation on AI. The Act bans AI systems which pose unacceptable risk to society and makes users aware when they are interacting with generative AI or deepfakes.

Standing with Palestine, Ukraine and international law

Europe Matters because of its unparalleled contribution to peace and its unwavering adherence to international law. Faced with conflicts at our borders and threats to democracy, the EU’s role in the wider world is more important than ever.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Work for a two-state solution in the Middle East.

• Continue to work to urgently chart a way out of this Israel-Hamas war.

• Maintain support and solidarity for Ukraine.

• Promote democracy and human rights.

• Engage proactively with China.

• Provide climate finance to developing states.

Work for a two-state solution in the Middle East Ireland formally recognises Palestine as a sovereign independent State, with effect from May 28th 2024. Fianna Fáil has always supported a two-state solution which respects the 1967 borders and guarantees peace and security for both Palestine and Israel. As the main financial donor to Palestine, the EU has a major role to play in the two-state solution. The EU must increase humanitarian aid to Gaza and be ready to assist in post-conflict reconstruction.

Fianna Fáil’s clear position over recent decades has been for Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory to end and for Palestinians to enjoy the same freedom and right to self-determination as others. In Government, Fianna Fáil led Ireland to become the first EU Member State to declare that a solution to the conflict in the Middle East had to be based on a fully sovereign State of Palestine, independent of and coexisting with Israel. That position was launched in 1980 by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Lenihan Snr, who said that the Palestinian people “had a right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State in Palestine”.

Continue to work to urgently chart a way out of this Israel-Hamas war Fianna Fáil has consistently condemned the actions of Hamas on October 7th. We believe that EU leaders should exert maximum pressure to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the unconditional release of all hostages and a massive surge in humanitarian aid. Fianna Fáil has been clear and consistent in its condemnation of violent settler activity in Occupied Palestinian Territory, and our MEPs will continue to advance the case for sanctions and travel bans for those engaged in such activity.

Maintain support and solidarity for Ukraine Russia’s illegal war has had appalling consequences for the Ukrainian people, as well as wider implications for security on the European continent. Fianna Fáil fully supports the EU’s aggressive sanctions and will continue to seek ways to punish Russia financially and diplomatically and to reinvest their monies on rebuilding Ukraine. We are unwavering in our support for Ukraine and will continue vital political, financial, and humanitarian assistance.

Fianna Fáil supports a European future for the people of Ukraine and views EU membership as a long-term security guarantee. We actively lobbied for and support the decision to open accession negotiations.

Promote democracy and human rights The EU must take the lead in promoting democracy and human rights. Fianna Fáil MEPs will support EU democracy promotion initiatives, such as funding for civil society, Election Observation Missions and the European Endowment for Democracy.

Engage proactively with China Fianna Fáil remains committed to engagement with China and to working together constructively on climate change and sustainable development. In our engagement, we underline China’s responsibility to uphold the UN Charter and protect human rights.

We must ensure that the Single Market is not harmed by any trade practices. The European Commission sees China as both a partner for cooperation and a systemic rival. We support this view and the EU policy of de-risking which aims to limit Europe’s excessive dependencies on China.

Provide climate finance to developing states Developing states are the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. By 2025, Ireland will have met our commitment to provide €225 million annually in climate finance. This, combined with contributions from other EU states, will help mitigate the worst impacts for those countries on the front line. Fianna Fáil will ensure that the EU, as the largest donor of climate finance globally, continues to support vulnerable communities.

Promoting education and youth engagement

Europe Matters for our young people. Young people in Ireland today have access to numerous opportunities and an important part of this has been various EU initiatives, which must continue to be adequately resourced.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Strengthen Erasmus+.

• Expand the free interrail initiative.

• Embrace the EU Aid Volunteer Initiative & the European Solidarity Corps.

• Promote engagement with the EU in schools.

• Twin secondary schools.

• Support Ukrainian youth.

Strengthen Erasmus+ Erasmus strengthens language skills, improves education outcomes, enhances life experience and increases employment opportunities. Fianna Fáil believes that every young person should have access to Erasmus+.

We welcome the programme’s expansion to encompass work placements, as well as the increased focus on mobility for people with disabilities. However, we must do more to ensure that Erasmus+ is open to all, with targeted actions to support students from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds to take part. We are also committed to ensuring that Northern Ireland, Ukraine and Palestine retain access to Erasmus.

Expand the free interrail initiative Interrailing is important to allow as many young people as possible to explore the continent of Europe. The DiscoverEU pass, which offers a free interrail ticket, a return flight to and from Ireland, as well as discounts on cultural attractions is a very positive initiative which should be supported and expanded. Fianna Fáil will campaign for every young person to receive a DiscoverEUpass upon turning 18, including all 18-year-olds from Northern Ireland. We will also take steps to ensure that young people with disabilities have full and equal access to the scheme. Embrace the EU Aid Volunteer Initiative & the European Solidarity Corps Given our strong tradition of assistance to developing countries, Ireland can play a lead role in the EU Aid Initiative and the European Solidarity Corps. We will promote both programmes in schools, universities and workplaces to encourage more young people to get involved.

Promote engagement with the EU in schools Primary and secondary school students should also experience what the EU has to offer. Fianna Fáil wholeheartedly supports the European Movement Ireland’s Blue Star Programme, which teaches primary school children about the EU and other Member States, as well as the provision of the Big Friendly Guide to the European

Union to all primary school children. Equally, we support the European Parliament Liaisons’ Office’s EPAS in secondary schools to promote the work of Irish MEPs. Fianna Fáil will continue to promote the European Youth Parliament and visits to the European Parliament for secondary schools.

Twin secondary schools Town twinning is one of the biggest successes in European cultural initiatives. Twinning should be expanded to secondary schools to foster links between young people across the EU. This will allow students to gain language skills and experience other cultures.

Support Ukrainian Youth The young people of Ukraine must be prioritised – they are the country’s future. Along with our Renew Europe colleagues, Fianna Fáil MEPs will seek EU support for counselling services, focused on young people affected by Russia’s war and young military personnel transitioning back to civilian life. Volunteers with the European Solidarity Corps should be deployed to Ukraine when safe to do so to help with postconflict reconstruction and youth engagement.

Supporting our cultural sector

Member States are responsible for their own cultural and sporting policies. However, the EU plays an important role in preserving and promoting European and Irish culture.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Reinforce EU cultural initiatives.

• Create a 65+ interrail pass.

• Launch an EU Culture pass.

• Fund EU-wide sporting competitions.

Reinforce EU cultural initiatives Fianna Fáil supports EU cultural initiatives, such as the Capital City of Culture and Creative Europe, which supports the audio-visual sector. We welcome rules obliging streaming platforms to have a minimum 30% European content available, as this provides opportunities for the Irish audio-visual sector. Our MEPs will seek support for cultural spaces for independent artists and organisations.

Create a 65+ travel pass Fianna Fáil will advocate for a discount card, similar to DiscoverEU, offering discounted travel from Ireland to the continent, discounted train travel across the EU and access to cultural attractions for all EU citizens aged 65 and over.

Launch an EU culture pass Along with our Renew Europe colleagues, Fianna Fáil advocates for a European culture pass app. This would provide young people turning 18 a virtual pre-loaded card to redeem against European books, films and video games or purchase tickets for museums, theatre, festivals, concerts etc.

Fund EU-wide sporting competitions Sport strengthens bonds across all sectors of society across Europe. A new EU fund to support cross-continental sporting competitions should be established. It should be available for those competing in sport at all ability levels.

Cooperating on public health.

COOPERATING ON PUBLIC HEALTH

Europe Matters because it helps the Member States achieve our public health goals. The speed at which the EU was able to attain and distribute COVID-19 vaccines proves that we are stronger when we work together.

Fianna Fáil will:

• Build a Public Health Union.

• Ensure Pandemic Preparedness.

• Strengthen European health agencies.

• Guaranteeing equal access to treatments.

• Encourage European innovation.

• Promote health education.

Build a Public Health Union Working collaboratively on public health measures can improve health outcomes. Fianna Fáil supports a limited sharing of competences with the EU in the area of public health, as it will support the development of innovative treatments.

Ensure pandemic preparedness Fianna Fáil supports increased cooperation on cross-border health threats. This will assist Member States in their preparedness in the case of another pandemic. Cooperation should include joint procurement of medical products, particularly medicines in short supply.

COVID-19 laid bare the need for Member States to stress test the resilience of their health systems. Tests should be carried out under criteria set at EU level to ensure the highest standards.

A digital platform should be established to facilitate exchanges on epidemiological data and best practice between the Member States.

Strengthen European health agencies With Renew Europe colleagues, Fianna Fáil will advocate for increased resources for both the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to ensure that they can efficiently carry out their vital work.

Guaranteeing equal access to treatments Fianna Fáil believes that the EU should create a comprehensive pathway for treatments from development to access, which balances innovation and affordability and reduces delays for patients. The pathway must provide access to complex therapies, such as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, that can only be delivered in a few specialised centres throughout the EU.

Encourage European innovation The pharmaceutical industry is a major contributor to the European economy.

We need to support its competitiveness. Currently, 80% of global pharmaceutical manufacturing takes place outside the EU. To fight shortages of medicines and medical devices, we will encourage industries to relocate to Europe. We must increase the attractiveness of the EU, especially Ireland, as a destination for clinical trials, so people living with rare diseases can have the earliest possible access to innovative treatments. Equally, we must encourage EU innovation and provide research funding to our domestic pharma industry. This will make it easier to produce generic medicines at cheaper prices for our citizens.

Promote health education Every year, vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Large-scale vaccination campaigns brought about the eradication of many infectious diseases and significant decline in many others. The worrying phenomenon of disinformation on vaccination must be addressed. Fianna Fáil will use science

Foreword by Taoiseach Simon Harris TD

Never before have we faced such an important European election. The choice facing the country is the starkest it has faced in generations. A choice between opportunity and opportunism; substance and soundbites; hard work and cynicism.

In this time of global upheaval, Fine Gael MEPs offer a blend of experience, fresh thinking, know-how and an ability to influence, as part of the most powerful political grouping in Europe – the European People’s Party.

Of course, we don’t know exactly what’s ahead of us. When we published our European Manifesto in 2019, we didn’t have a deal on Brexit, we hadn’t yet seen Covid-19, the war in Ukraine, the cost of living crisis and the desperate situation in Gaza. Over the next five years, we know the circumstances will change, but we have a vision and a set of priorities that will guide us. They are:

1. Improving your quality of life

2. Working with farmers to build a fair, sustainable and food secure Europe

3. A more assertive foreign and defence policy

4. Firm and fair migration

5. Making Europe Competitive – promoting enterprise and fostering innovation

This manifesto details Fine Gael MEPs’ priorities over the next five years, based on the feedback we have received from voters up and down the country. It also incorporates feedback received from various public meetings organised by Fine Gael’s National Agricultural, Food and Rural Development Forum and Fine Gael’s Small Business and Enterprise Council.

To you, the reader, we want to ask you for your trust. We want to ask for your support. And we want to ask you for your vote. We promise if you give your vote to Fine Gael, we will work, day and night, to help make your life better. We will have your back. We will repay your trust. Together, we promise we will deliver. With a new energy.

FOREWORD

Foreword by Minister Jennifer Carroll MacNeill TD

Ireland’s membership of the EU has been transformative. Our country is almost unrecognisable from what it once was. The economic, social and political shifts over the past five decades have been nothing short of seismic.

Recent polling data from the European Movement Ireland shows that 84% of Irish people believe we should remain a member of the EU. That is an overwhelming endorsement, but we cannot take it for granted. Fine Gael representatives will work on your behalf to ensure that Ireland continues to benefit from our EU membership for the better and that we have influence to shape the EU agenda for the better.

Fifty years ago, Ireland benefitted from the EU’s very first enlargement. Over the next five years, we will help more countries to join and help them make the necessary reforms before accession. These countries have to do the work themselves but the EU and member states like Ireland must support them.

We find ourselves in an increasingly contested and volatile global environment. In particular, Russia’s brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine has clearly had a fundamental impact on Europe’s security, including on that of Ireland. We can no longer rely either on our geographic isolation for our security, nor believe that we can insulate ourselves from world events. We must work to broaden and deepen Ireland’s international security engagement as well as our domestic efforts to ensure the security of our country. It is incumbent on us to take our own security and responsibility towards our like-minded partners, particularly our fellow EU members, more seriously. Neutrality does not mean having no ability to protect ourselves or our own sovereignty.

Fine Gael will always stand up for democracy, rule of law and human rights. The behaviour of some MEPs towards disreputable regimes around the world has damaged Ireland’s reputation internationally. People are entitled to hold any views they like, but it is crucial that any MEP or MEP candidate is up front with the electorate about what they stand for and with whom they keep company.

We have faced many challenges over the past few years and we will face many more in the years to come. Through Brexit, Covid and war in Europe, we have demonstrated that we can get through these challenges, working together. It’s vital that we have our best people in the European Parliament working on your behalf. I urge you to vote Fine Gael on Friday 7 June.

Jennifer Carroll MacNeill TD Minister of State for European Affairs and Defence

INTRODUCTION

FINE GAEL AT THE HEART OF EUROPE

Fine Gael is the party of Europe, fully involved in the development of the EU and engaged with our EU partners. Ireland’s future lies in Europe, a common home we are helping to build.

Fine Gael representatives are at the heart of European policymaking for decades. We are a proud member of the European People’s Party, the most influential political block in EU decision-making. The EPP includes 84 parties and partners from 44 countries, the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Parliament, 12 EU and 3 non-EU heads of state and government and 10 members of the European Commission. Crucially, the EPP Group is the largest in the European Parliament and is in a strong position to help shape and deliver legislation that meets the needs of our time.

From the late former Taoiseach John Bruton and Taoisigh Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar and Simon Harris, to former Tánaistí Simon Coveney and Frances Fitzgerald, Fine Gael public representatives have been in the room when it matters, shaping decisions and giving Irish people a voice in Europe. Our former MEP and First Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness has been leading on the European agenda as a Commissioner and Minister Paschal Donohoe is serving his second term as President of the Eurogroup of finance ministers from euro zone member states.

The Irish people are generally pro-European and pro-European Union and that appreciation grew during the difficult Brexit negotiations. We don’t take that position for granted. We must work to ensure that the EU evolves to reflect the wishes of EU citizens and provides strong leadership in these fraught geopolitical times. There is work to do in the coming years, challenges to be overcome and opportunities to be grasped. Fine Gael MEPs will – as they have always done – work to ensure that strategic vulnerabilities are addressed, including energy and critical supply chains.

As digitalisation moves apace, we will work on EU efforts to take advantage of the benefits of artificial intelligence and other developments, while constantly monitoring the risks, including cyberattacks. We will work collaboratively with our European neighbours on climate change and the huge potential of green technologies and renewable energy.

Europe, its values and its way of life are under attack – through physical war and by other means, which threaten our daily lives, our freedom and democracy. We choose multilateralism over nationalism, rule of law over autocracy and free trade over protectionism.

Fine Gael takes the EU seriously, sends our best people to the European Parliament and celebrates the benefits that EU membership brings to Ireland. Too many other parties and candidates seek to attack or undermine the EU to disguise domestic challenges or to duck hard decisions.

Fine Gael is committed to being in the room to find solutions that benefit our citizens. Unlike other candidates or parties, we will not be outside the room complaining.

BROLLACH

FINE GAEL I GCROÍLÁR

NA HEORPA

Is é Fine Gael páirtí na hEorpa. Tá sé lánpháirteach i bhforbairt an AE agus i mbun pléite lenár gcomhpháirtithe AE. Is san Eoraip atá todhchaí na hÉireann, baile coiteann a bhfuilimid ag cur leis.

Tá ionadaithe Fhine Gael i gcroílár cheapadh polasaí na hEorpa le blianta fada. Is ball bródúil muid de Pháirtí an Phobail Eorpaigh, an bloc polaitiúil is mó tionchair i gcinnteoireacht an AE. Tá 83 pháirtí agus chomhpháirtithe ó 44 thír san EPP agus Uachtarán an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh, Uachtarán Pharlaimint na hEorpa, 12 cheann stáit agus ceannairí rialtais AE agus 3 cheann stáit agus ceannairí rialtais neamh-AE agus 10 gcomhalta de chuid an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh. Thar aon rud eile, is é an Grúpa EPP an grúpa is mó i bParlaimint na hEorpa agus tá sé i suíomh láidir chun cabhrú le reachtaíocht a mhúnlú agus a sholáthar a fhreastalaíonn ar riachtanais ár linne.

Ón iarThaoiseach John Bruton nach maireann agus ó na Taoisigh Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar agus Simon Harris, go dtí na hiarThánaistí Simon Coveney agus Frances Fitzgerald, bhí ionadaithe Fhine Gael sa seomra nuair a theastaíonn sé, ag múnlú cinntí agus ag tabhairt ghutha do mhuintir na hÉireann san Eoraip. Tá ár n-iarFPE agus an Chéad Leas-Uachtarán de chuid Pharlaimint na hEorpa, Mairéad McGuinness, chun tosaigh ar an gclár Eorpach mar Choimisinéir agus tá an tAire Paschal Donohoe ag cur a dhara téarma isteach mar Uachtarán ar an nGrúpa Euro d’airí airgeadais ó bhallstáit i limistéar an euro.

Tá muintir na hÉireann ar son na hEorpa agus ar son an Aontais Eorpaigh go hiondúil agus mhéadaigh an tuiscint sin le linn na gcainteanna deacra faoin mBreatimeacht. Ní dhéanaimid talamh slán den seasamh sin. Ní mór dúinn oibriú le cinntiú go bhforbraíonn an AE chun mianta shaoránaigh an AE a léiriú agus ceannaireacht láidir a sholáthar le linn na tréimhse geopholaitiúla corraí seo. Tá obair le déanamh sna blianta amach romhainn, dúshláin le sárú agus deiseanna le tapú. Oibreoidh FPE Fhine Gael - mar a rinne siad riamh - le cinntiú go dtabharfar aghaidh ar laigí straitéiseacha, lena n-áirítear fuinneamh agus slabhraí soláthair criticiúla.

De réir mar a fhorbraítear an digitiú go sciobtha, oibreoimid ar iarrachtaí AE leas a bhaint as buntáistí na hintleachta shaorga agus forbairtí eile, agus faireachán leanúnach a dhéanamh againn ar na rioscaí, lena n-áirítear cibearionsaithe. Comhoibreoimid lenár gcomharsana Eorpacha maidir leis an athrú aeráide agus acmhainneacht ollmhór na dteicneolaíochtaí glasa agus na bhfoinsí fuinnimh in-athnuaite.

Tá an Eoraip, a cuid luachanna agus a slí mhaireachtála faoi ionsaí - trí chogadh fisiciúil agus ar bhealaí eile, a chuireann ár saol laethúil, ár saoirse agus ár ndaonlathas i mbaol. Roghnóimid iltaobhachas thar an náisiúnachas, riail an dlí thar an uathlathas agus saorthrádáil thar chaomhnaitheacht.

Tá Fine Gael dáiríre faoin Aontas Eorpach, cuireann sé ár ndaoine is fearr chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa agus déanann sé ceiliúradh ar na buntáistí a thugann ballraíocht AE d’Éirinn. Tá an iomarca páirtithe agus iarrthóirí ag iarraidh an AE a ionsaí nó an bonn a bhaint de chun dúshláin intíre a cheilt nó cinntí crua a sheachaint.

Tá Fine Gael tiomanta do bheith sa seomra chun teacht ar réitigh a rachaidh chun tairbhe dár saoránaigh. Murab ionann is iarrthóirí nó páirtithe eile, ní bheimid lasmuigh den seomra ag gearán.

IMPROVING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE

The European project is about peace and prosperity by improving the lives of all. Amid the political, bureaucratic and technical discourse, this can sometimes be forgotten. Fine Gael will ensure that citizens’ voices are heard in the debates in Brussels and Strasbourg and strive at all times to make the lives of all – young, old and those with special needs – easier.

Understanding how the EU works

While Irish people are generally pro-European, this sentiment should be informed by knowledge and understanding. This is all the more important in an era of disinformation and misinformation. Fine Gael will continue to back initiatives that seek to educate people about Europe, such as the Blue Star Programme, which teaches primary school pupils about European cultures and the EU.

Consumer Rights

For the past 50 years, EU consumers enjoy a wide range of rights and protections. They include:

• The right to health protection and safety

• The right to protection of economic interests

• The right to damages

• The right to information and education

• The right to representation

• The right to repair.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure the consumer is at the heart of our economy, protecting consumer rights across the EU, particularly in the online world.

• Help consumers avoid exploitation in the online market and ensure their data is not misused or their data rights breached. This is vital for the digital transition.

Social Rights

In 2017, EU leaders signed up to the European Pillar of Social Rights, based around (i) equal opportunities and access to the labour market, (ii) fair working conditions and (iii) social protection and inclusion. This is about ensuring economic progress goes hand-in-hand with social progress. Given the huge digital, climate and geopolitical developments since then, it’s essential that we re-focus this agenda for the next five years.

Fine Gael MEPs will:

• Shape the review of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan in 2025, ensuring it reflects Ireland’s priorities, promoting workers, promoting enterprise and ensuring competitiveness.

Education Opportunities

The Erasmus student exchange programme has been a crucially important educational and cultural programme for Europe. Launched in 1985 by the late Peter Sutherland when he was European Commissioner for Education, the programme facilitates 200,000 students ever year to go on exchange around Europe. For the past five years, the European Universities Initiative is encouraging more strategic collaboration between European institutions and we want this initiative to go further in the coming years.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to ensure the Erasmus+ programme is adequately funded and that enough places are available to Irish students.

The loss of access to the Erasmus+ Programme for Northern Ireland students was one of the many problems Brexit caused. In his previous role as Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science,

last July Simon Harris allocated €2 million to support higher education students in Northern Ireland to avail of mobilities and internships across Europe. There is a big North-South dimension to this programme, with many internships taking place in key locations including the Financial Services sector in the IFSC in Dublin.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure Northern Ireland students are funded to take up Erasmus opportunities in Ireland and across the EU.

• Support proposals for the UK to re-join the Erasmus+ student exchange system.

Research Opportunities

The EU’s €95 billion Horizon Europe programme is invaluable to our researchers and innovators. It’s crucial to Europe’s ability to stay competitive and plan for the green, digital and AI transitions, as well as advances in medicine. We welcome that the UK has now rejoined the programme, opening up more opportunities for collaboration.

We must work hard to ensure that Irish institutes are supported to collaborate with other institutes across the EU and compete with the best.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to agree an ambitious successor programme to Horizon Europe.

• Support the development and proper funding of the European Universities Initiative.

Digital Safety, Regulation and Policy

The EU and Ireland are jointly responsible for ensuring everyone, especially children, are safe online. The EU is to the forefront internationally in introducing new laws attempting to regulate what people see on online platforms. Many large technology companies are based in Ireland and we have a bigger responsibility than most to ensure online safety. We must also strike the right balance between regulation and innovation.

Ireland wants to be a digital leader, at the heart of European and global developments. While getting regulation right is important, we also want to see Ireland and Europe becoming global digital leaders, helping companies to stay ahead of the curve.

Fine Gael will:

• Work with EU and Irish colleagues to ensure Irish children are kept safe online.

• Support the proposed revision of the combating child sexual abuse Directive (2011/93/EU).

• Ensure Ireland’s Data Protection Commission is adequately resourced, as well as all the other regulatory authorities with responsibilities in the digital area.

• Work to safeguard the country-of-origin principle, which is important to multinationals’ presence in Ireland, and advocate for an appropriate regulatory framework at EU level.

• Support the use of Facial Recognition Technology and support EU legislation which provides for it.

• Promote digital innovation and enterprise in Ireland and across the EU.

Violence Against Women

The EU has just passed a new law to combat Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence. It gives women the same level of protection across Europe regardless of the Member State they reside in. Europe can be the first continent in the world to end violence against women. It’s a wide-ranging law, from female genital mutilation, to cyber stalking and harassment and steps to prevent rape. Member states have three years to implement the provisions.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to ensure Ireland swiftly implements the provisions of the new law to combat Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence.

• Ensure the EU fully implements the Istanbul Convention.

Healthcare for all Europeans

Irish people are very aware of the health benefits that come from EU membership. We want to go further, especially on access to medicines.

The new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe is designed to ensure access to affordable, available medicines, while maintaining the competitiveness of the EU pharmaceutical industry sector. The Strategy must be pro-competition and pro-innovation, where new research is rewarded.

The EU’s Beating Cancer Plan aims to tackle the entire disease pathway, with a focus on prevention, early detection, treatment, and quality of life. This plan needs to be updated and boosted with more funding to make sure it is as effective as possible.

We must ensure that the solidarity displayed by the EU during Covid to ensure faster, less expensive access to vaccines, is repeated to give citizens greater access to life changing drugs.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to reduce the cost and ensure timely access to new and existing drugs for consumers, while also promoting pharmaceutical innovation.

• Back the Beating Cancer Plan and build upon it by developing a European plan to address Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and Parkinson’s disease.

• Develop a European Cardiovascular Health Plan, as cardiovascular disease is the biggest killer in the EU. This plan should include a European Knowledge Centre and promote a Joint cardiovascular and diabetes health check, as 85% of the people living with diabetes die from cardiovascular disease.

• Work to create a true European Health Union to improve the resilience of our health systems and their interoperability, train the best doctors and nurses, to be equipped to deal with cross-border threats, diversify our supply chains and create strategic inventories to prevent medicine and medical devices shortages, making them accessible to every citizen.

• Work to become an international leader in medical research and pharmaceutical innovation while increasing access to clinical trials, especially to fight rare child diseases such as cancer that do not get enough funding for research.

• Work to double the EU’s research budget for the period 2024-2027 while setting a target of 4% of European GDP devoted to research and innovation by 2030.

Mental Health

It is estimated that around 1 in 6 Europeans suffered from mental health issues before the pandemic. The situation has deteriorated since then and we must respond.

Fine Gael will:

• Campaign for better EU funding for mental health,

guidelines and best practice examples.

• Work to establish mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of mental health policies at an EU level, to ensure accountability and effectiveness across member states.

European Child Guarantee

We are committed to meeting our obligations under the European Child Guarantee and ensuring that every child in Europe at risk of poverty or social exclusion has access to the most basic rights. We have already published an Action Plan to meet these obligations and our response to the European Child Guarantee has been further strengthened by the establishment of the Child Poverty and Well-Being Office in the Department of the Taoiseach.

A Europe for All Ages

As Europe ages, we will work to promote active and healthy ageing for all generations and further develop the ‘silver’, longevity economy. Seniors are increasingly shaping our economies and starting businesses. We must empower people so that they are confident in managing their personal finances.

Fine Gael will:

• Focus on financial literacy to help people plan for their retirement and feel more comfortable online, aware of the benefits but also the threats that come with risks like online fraud.

• Invest in age-friendly cities and regions. We will work to strengthen the European Care Strategy and to implement solutions for affordable long-term care for the elderly and other vulnerable individuals in all communities

• We will support proposals to establish a European Guarantee for older citizens to ensure social inclusion and their full participation in society and the economy.

EU Disability Card

All EU citizens with disabilities should be supported to have full and productive lives, with the same rights in every EU Member State. The European Parliament has just given the green light to a new EU Disability card, which will serve as proof of status across all EU countries and give cardholders equal access to special conditions and preferential treatments anywhere in the EU. Fine Gael will prioritise the implementation of this proposal and ensure the Irish Government takes swift action on its rollout.

Working with Europe on Housing

We need to step up our level of ambition on housing.

We will need extra workers, more funding and modern methods of construction. There are challenges across the European Union with regard to the supply of suitably qualified workers for the construction sector, so we need to work at a European level to get more young people to choose construction as a career and create more opportunities for older workers to reskill.

Other European countries are much further ahead than Ireland when it comes to adopting new technologies in the construction sector, including rapid build homes. This is sometimes related to scale but Ireland needs these new technologies. We also need to source extra financing from the private sector and from EU institutions. Last October, the European Investment Bank and the Housing Finance Agency agreed €434 million in funding to build 2,700 affordable student beds. We will look to finance more projects in the years ahead.

This is the European year of skills which is highlighting the need for skills training and upskilling in key sectors, including construction. Higher number of apprenticeships are key in this regard, especially in the construction sector.

Fine Gael will:

• Work at a European level to promote construction as a career choice and look at ways to strengthen the delivery of apprenticeships – in particular construction apprenticeships – across member states.

• Work with European partners to ensure Ireland adopts modern methods of construction.

• Explore new funding opportunities for housing and other areas through the European Investment Bank.

• Develop a European strategy to attract skilled construction workers from outside the European Union to come and work in Europe.

Climate Action

Climate change is the biggest challenge facing this generation and the EU is the world’s fastest-warming continent. Addressing climate action is central to the EU Strategic Agenda for 2024-2029 – that is, the EU’s political priorities. We need to work together on climate action. This is not a moment for division, for lecturing or

imposing. It is about pragmatic and meaningful policy and action to address the climate and biodiversity challenge.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure the EU prioritises climate policy over the coming five years.

• Prioritise pragmatic and meaningful actions on climate change.

• Work with communities and sectors to ensure a just transition for all.

Nature Restoration

The EU Nature Restoration Law aims to restore at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems by 2050. It’s about restoring wetlands, rivers, forests, grasslands and marine ecosystems for future generations.

Fine Gael MEPs voted in favour of the proposed law, once important amendments had been made. It achieves a balance between action to improve biodiversity, while safeguarding food security and guaranteeing that restoration measures will be voluntary for farmers. We believe the public, farmers and fishers recognise the need to take action to tackle biodiversity loss. Under this law, the only farmers involved will be those who wish to voluntarily participate. Irish state lands will be available to contribute to almost all of the rewetting commitments. Even if the legislation is not fully in place yet, we know that landowners and households are already taking action to enhance habitats and adopt nature friendly practices.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure action to restore nature is fair, implemented effectively and backed with proper funding, in consultation with local communities.

Cheaper and more reliable energy

We have set ourselves the ambition of halving Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade and becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We are making good progress, but we need to do more, working with local communities.

Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities when it comes to energy. We simply rely too much on undemocratic parts of the world for

our energy supplies. Already, the EU has responded, diversifying our supply base, investing in renewables and using energy more efficiently. Over the next five years, we must go further on renewable energy development, to improve our energy security, drive down the cost of electricity by removing expensive imported fossil fuels from the system and reach our climate targets.

Ireland’s maritime area is almost seven times the size of our land area. This provides us with a huge, as of yet, untapped opportunity, when it comes to electricity generation, especially with advances in technology for floating wind energy. We cannot only secure our own energy requirements, but can become a net exporter of electricity from Ireland across Europe

As we rapidly develop European renewables, EU Member States’ electricity grids need to be modernised. An inter-connected EU grid is the objective to allow power flow freely across and between member states. Our planning process can result in excessive delays which discourages investors and delays the delivery of renewable energy. The Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund is our commitment to ensuring strategic investments.

The Celtic Interconnector will enable the exchange of 700MW of electricity between Ireland and France, with the capacity to supply electricity to 450,000 homes.

The European Union is partly funding it as a ‘Project of Common Interest (PCI) – one of 100 such projects across the EU. We need more such projects in the years ahead, with the backing of local communities.

Networks have to become more digitalised, decentralised and flexible. It means millions of rooftop solar panels, heat pumps and local energy communities sharing their resources, more offshore renewables and more electric vehicles. Around 40% of Europe’s distribution grids are more than 40 years old and cross-border transmission capacity is due to double by 2030. Investment is needed to upgrade this infrastructure to the benefit of consumers and businesses.

Ireland is overly dependent on gas and this is a security of supply, economic and climate risk. We need to diversify our sources of energy to become carbon neutral in the

long term. Renewable Hydrogen technology will over the longer-term be a key component of a zero-carbon economy. It provides the potential for long-duration energy storage, dispatchable renewable electricity and a potential export market opportunities, given Ireland’s excellent wind resources. Planning for this kind of future requires collaboration across the EU and we will encourage further EU work in this area, which is very much in Ireland’s interests.

Fine Gael will:

• Support more onshore and offshore renewable energy developments.

• Work to improve electricity interconnection across the EU and ensure everyone can benefit from our shared resources, particularly wind energy in the northern part of Europe and solar in the south.

• Work at European, national and local level to ensure Ireland’s electricity grid can meet the demand of new renewables coming on stream.

• Support further investment by the EU in hydrogen-related research and development initiatives.

• Develop the conditions for Ireland to become a net exporter of electricity in time.

Better public transport

Better public transport is essential if we are to meet our climate goals and provide good service to commuters. Moving from a car dependent transport system will require lower fares to encourage people to make the switch, a more integrated public transport network and better facilities. We will take learnings from other member states of the EU, as we invest unprecedented levels of capital funding in the years ahead.

Given that freedom of movement is such an essential element of EU membership, Fine Gael will explore the possibility of agreeing an EU-wide version of the Irish free travel scheme to improve mobility and reduce cost of living pressures for older people in the EU.

Fine Gael will:

• Work in the European Parliament with representatives of each member state to implement an EU free travel scheme on the same criteria as the Irish one.

• Work to ensure all sources of EU financing are drawn down to deliver public transport projects in Ireland.

• Develop opportunities for a better EV charging network which ensures urban and rural dwellers have access to sufficient charging points.

Balanced regional development across the EU

Domestically in Ireland, we must continue to redress regional imbalances and ensure there is not a drift towards Dublin and the east coast. The forthcoming revision of the National Planning Framework is another opportunity to ensure a spatial plan – linked to the National Development Plan – can achieve a prosperous and regionally balanced Ireland. At EU level, we must also address imbalances. Post-Brexit, it’s even more important that Ireland harnesseses the potential of regions working together to access funding and improve services for people.

Fine Gael will:

Work with other regions across Europe to boost the economic and social potential of all parts of Ireland. The EU must work to improve the lives of all citizens, no matter where they are living.

Promoting the Irish language

Since 1 January 2022, the Irish language is officially on an equal footing with the EU’s other 23 official languages. This is a big achievement but we still have a long way to go and must build on this progress in the coming years.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to promote the practice of EU students completing a semester in Galway, Donegal or other areas via University of Galway’s Acadamh in the Gaeltacht or Kerry/Cork with UCC or MTU.

• Work in the European Parliament and other EU institutions to identify more sources of funding to promote the Irish language.

• Promote the Irish language as a draw for tourism. We must tap into Ireland’s huge diaspora and encourage our European friends to discover An Ghaeilge.

• Support businesses to use bilingual packaging, where possible, and provided this can be done cost effectively.

An Ghaeilge a Chur Chun Cinn

Ón 1 Eanáir 2022, tá an Ghaeilge ar chomhchéim leis an 23 theanga oifigiúla AE eile go hoifigiúil. Is éacht mór é seo ach tá bóthar fada romhainn fós agus caithfimid cur leis an dul chun cinn seo sna blianta amach romhainn. .

Déanfaidh Fine Gael an méid seo a leanas:

• Oibriú chun cleachtas mac léinn an AE atá ag críochnú seimeastair i nGaillimh, i nDún na nGall nó i gceantair eile trí Acadamh Ollscoil na Gaillimhe sa Ghaeltacht nó i gCiarraí/i gCorcaigh le UCC nó MTU a chur chun cinn.

• Oibriú i bParlaimint na hEorpa agus in institiúidí eile an AE chun tuilleadh foinsí maoinithe a aithint chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.

• An Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar tharraingt don turasóireacht. Ní mór dúinn leas a bhaint as diaspóra ollmhór na hÉireann agus ár gcairde Eorpacha a spreagadh le spéis a chur sa Ghaeilge.

• Tacú le gnólachtaí pacáistíocht dhátheangach a úsáid, nuair is féidir, agus ar an gcoinníoll gur féidir é sin a dhéanamh go cost-éifeachtúil.

Irish workers in the EU Institutions

Ireland has punched above its weight for decades in the European Union institutions. Irish officials have reached the upper echelons consistently but we need to ensure that Irish people continue to play their part at every level in EU agencies and institutions. We must step up work on new ways to encourage young Irish people to pursue a career in the EU. Better language skills are an important part of this task.

Fine Gael will:

• Work with EU institutions and the Irish Government to ensure more Irish people pursue a career in the EU.

• Work with third level providers on a roadmap for students to gain the skills for a career in the EU.

• Develop a communications programme to create greater awareness amongst school-leavers and graduates of career opportunities in the EU

• Work with EU institutions and the Irish Government to support the Irish language’s full status as an official language of the European Union. It is important that we have a steady pipeline of translators to fill relevant posts.

WORKING WITH FARMERS TO BUILD A FAIR, SUSTAINABLE AND FOOD SECURE EUROPE

Fine Gael is the party of farmers, fishers and rural Ireland. Agriculture is Ireland’s oldest indigenous sector and remains a vital part of our economy and society. The role of farmers in ensuring food security and protecting the countryside must be recognised and rewarded.

As Taoiseach Simon Harris has said, Fine Gael will never talk down to farmers or rural Ireland. We will sit down and work with them and for them. We are committed to engaging in a new partnership with farmers, one where they are central to the changes we are making.

A Green Deal for European farmers must be a fair one.

Ireland’s unique farming model based on grass-based production and family farms must be protected and safeguarded in EU agricultural policy.

Fine Gael will:

• Engage in a new partnership on agriculture where farmers are central to delivering on our food, environment and rural development targets.

• Be a strong pro-farmer voice at the decision-making table of European legislation and policy.

• Ensure farmers’ social and economic sustainability is considered alongside environmental sustainability in the European Green Deal and Farm to Fork Strategy.

Common Agricultural Policy

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been critical for the development of Irish agriculture over the last 50 years.

At its heart we believe the purpose of the CAP should be

to support active farmers in the production of a stable supply of quality food, to underpin a reasonable quality of life for farmers, and to assist in tackling climate change and other challenges.

The CAP has ensured safe and affordable food for EU consumers. It has allowed EU farming produce to gain a foothold in global markets. This is especially important for Irish agriculture. Farmers want to be able to produce food, secure a fair price for their produce and make their contribution to environment and climate delivery.

We are now into the second year of the current reform which is due to run until 2027. We acknowledge farmer frustrations with red tape, increasingly complex schemes, and concerns it is not delivering the best results for farmers, consumers, or the environment.

Work should begin now on drawing up proposals for a simpler, more effective CAP post 2027. Securing the budget for the CAP in the overall budget negotiations and shaping further reform of CAP will be a key task of those elected to the European Parliament in June.

Fine Gael will:

• Fight for a post-2027 CAP budget that reflects the importance of the work farmers do – supporting food production and positive environmental action.

• Any new measures proposed in the new CAP budget should not be at the expense of existing funding.

• Target supports towards active farmers and place a special emphasis on farm succession by exploring approaches that encourage new entrants while supporting older generations.

• Simplify the administrative burden on farms by pushing for flexibly designed and farmer-friendly schemes and compliance measures that fairly reward farmers across all sectors for actions undertaken.

• Undertake a review of payment redistribution measures in the current CAP that considers their impact on farm viability.

• Work to enhance supports to encourage farm capital investments in addition to supports for farmers to undertake action on biodiversity and water quality.

• Highlight the importance of increased investment by the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine in IT capabilities to avoid payment delays.

Engaging with farmers on new EU policies

Outside of the Common Agricultural Policy a number of other pieces of legislation have a significant impact on agriculture. Areas such as the Habitats Directive, the Water Framework Directive, and newer proposals such as the Nature Restoration Law and Industrial Emissions Directive contain a number of provisions specific to agriculture.

It is important that the views of farmers and the agricultural sector are at the decision-making table when these pieces of legislation are being discussed. Working in partnership with farmers, rather than confrontation, is the best way to achieve results.

Fine Gael will:

• Prioritise voluntary, well-funded schemes that support farmers to carry out positive environmental actions, bringing new sources of funding into the sector in addition to the CAP.

• Ensure the family farm model is protected and that sustainable, grass-based production is not classified as industrial activity.

• Respect the right of farmers to determine what they do with their own farms and land. Growth in areas such as forestry and organics must encourage farmers to integrate these options as part of their wider farm enterprise in a way that best suits them.

• Maximise all EU funding avenues to support farmers integrating renewable energy opportunities such as solar energy or anaerobic digestion into their farming operation.

• Support a review of the EU’s Unfair Trading Practices to consider the effectiveness of the current legislation in supporting the work of Ireland’s Agri-Food Regulator (An Rialálaí Agraibhia) in bringing fairness and transparency to the sector.

Supporting Fishers

We are committed to the sustainable development of the fisheries sector, ensuring that stocks are protected so the next generation have the opportunity to continue the family tradition of deriving an income from the sea.

Coastal communities face a unique set of challenges. Supporting the Irish fishing industry will benefit economic activity in these areas and help protect our maritime environments.

Fine Gael will:

• Commit to a review of the Common Fisheries Policy.

• Support a strong European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund.

Nitrates Derogation

The Nitrates Derogation is an important element of sustainable grass-based production in Ireland. The nitrates derogation allows farmers to operate in a more economically viable way in return for complying with a higher set of standards. The sector is committed to improving water quality as part of this effort. Agriculture is not solely responsible for impacts on water quality but it does have a role to play. Farmers have already shown their willingness to take action in this area and it is important that they are further supported.

Fine Gael will:

• Work with state agencies, local authorities, industry, and farm organisations to bring forward practical solutions which benefit farmers and help Ireland retain our derogation after 2025.

• Highlight to our colleagues across Europe, the unique circumstances in Ireland that give rise to the derogation and use our influence within the EPP to protect the derogation.

• Continue to invest in initiatives that allow farmers to make improvements to their farms that positively impact water quality.

A MORE ASSERTIVE FOREIGN, DEFENCE AND SECURITY POLICY

Along with our European People’s Party colleagues, we will work to build a Europe that can defend itself. It’s simply not credible for Ireland to leave it to others. We must play our part. The world has changed. Threats are likely to come from cyber warfare and on the battlefield. It’s time that Ireland adopts a more assertive foreign, defence and security policy. This can be done in a way that protects our policy of military neutrality.

The Irish State has a proud history of peace-keeping and making our mark in the world. The Irish people are also making a huge difference to the daily lives of millions of people around the world through official development assistance and by other means. Diplomatically, we punch above our weight and, working with like-minded countries, we can bring our influence to bear on global issues like migration, climate, international conflicts and human rights. Our membership of multilateral fora like the EU and the UN enhances, not dilutes, our power.

We have built strong relationships with our European neighbours and we will continue to work in partnership to uphold our shared values and objectives.

Russia should not have a say on where we send our peacekeeping troops. The triple lock is no longer fit for purpose and we will replace it with a new mechanism that protects our sovereignty, our military neutrality and remains fully consistent with the principles of the UN Charter and international law.

We must strengthen cybersecurity. There are increasing reports of foreign cyber attacks, disinformation and the misuse of spyware against journalists. Ireland must improve our own cyber defence capabilities and expertise and work with EU partners for a coordinated EU response.

Conflict in Gaza

We call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all remaining hostages. We need a surge in humanitarian assistance to Gaza and also to ensure access to that humanitarian assistance.

Ireland, Norway and Spain have taken the decision to recognise the State of Palestine, while we have also been clear we unequivocally recognise the State of Israel. We made this decision to help create a peaceful future. A two-state solution is the only credible path to peace and security for Israel, for Palestine and for their peoples.

Fine Gael will:

• Continue to press for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages as a strong and united voice with European and international colleagues.

• Continue to prioritise the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the Middle East peace process more broadly in our diplomatic efforts.

• Continue to make the case for a meaningful interpretation of Israel’s human rights obligations under the EU-Israel association agreement at Commission level.

• Ensure the EU continues to provide multi-million euro funding to the UN’s aid agency in Palestine, UNRWA.

Conflict in Ukraine

Fine Gael and the European People’s Party are unequivocal in our support for Ukraine. We know war is a darkness that threatens all our democracies and our European values. We will always support democracy and freedom and we will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. Russia cannot win this war.

Fine Gael will:

• Stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.

• Support Ukraine’s efforts to achieve EU membership as soon as possible.

• Work to improve the sanctions regime against Russia and eradicate loopholes.

Defence Policy

Ireland is a founder member of PESCO. Fine Gael will seek to opt into programmes on a case-by-case basis. This does not compromise our policy of military neutrality and we will not be joining NATO.

We must monitor our borders in an age of increased maritime and haulage smuggling. The threat of terrorism now extends worldwide and physical borders are no longer as relevant.

EU Member States will sit down and work out the future of European cooperation on security and defence. Unlike other parties, Fine Gael wants to be in the room and to help shape that future.

Enlargement

Fine Gael is pro-European and we are pro-enlargement. Enlargement has been good for Europe and we believe the next significant enlargement should be into the western Balkans. We support the countries of the western Balkans, as well as Ukraine, joining the EU as soon as they are ready. The current geopolitical environment underscores the urgency of the situation. The EU has to show good faith towards those countries that have been waiting for a long time.

Fine Gael will:

• Support further enlargement of the EU.

Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs)

A cohort of Irish politicians, some of whom are standing in these elections, believe that threatening legal action rather than answering questions is how politics is best served.

In Ireland, through the Defamation Bill, we are introducing provisions for preventing strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) from exercising a ‘chilling effect’ on freedom of expression, and particularly, on investigative journalism or public debate on issues of public interest.

Fine Gael will:

• Monitor how the recent anti-SLAPP law at EU level is being implemented across all member states and examine if further measures are required.

Misinformation and Disinformation

While Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is 3,000km away, the war is already all around us in the form of cyber warfare and disinformation. We need to find ways to shatter the walls of misinformation that are encircling us. Education is our most potent weapon.

The EU has shown leadership in devising new laws to regulate online activity, but we need to do more to protect children online.

Fine Gael will:

• Develop critical media literacy programmes to empower people to discern truth from falsehood, neutralising the impact of disinformation campaigns.

• Work to tackle deepfakes and ensure social media companies act faster in taking down illegal content.

Reinvigorating our relationship with the UK

While the UK is no longer in the EU, we should work to enhance EU-UK relations. That ranges from the continued fallout from Brexit to enhanced cooperation on a range of different issues. For example, we strongly welcome that the UK has become an associated country to Horizon Europe, meaning its researchers can access Horizon Europe funding.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to enhance EU-UK cooperation on a range of issues, including education, research, energy, financial services, agri-food, transport and migration.

North-South Cooperation

Fine Gael played a pivotal role in ensuring there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. Brexit will never be ‘done’ – it will require constant attention and updating of rules.

The Windsor Framework gives Northern Ireland access to the EU single market for goods, while at the same time being part of the UK internal market. It’s important that the EU and UK implements the Trade and Cooperation

Agreement and the Withdrawal Agreement fully and in good faith.

The EU’s cross-border PEACE and PEACEPLUS programmes have provided funding of over €3 billion to promote shared peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland. The Interreg programme is also investing to promote cross-border cooperation on research and innovation, environmental protection, sustainable transport and health and social care.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to enhance north-south cooperation in areas of mutual benefit, including agriculture, transport, education, tourism, and the Single Electricity Market.

• Promote the continued funding of PEACEPLUS and Interreg programmes to help communities north and south.

• Continue to be a voice for the people of Northern Ireland at EU level.

• Utilise the EU to fund the growth of the all-island economy.

Encouraging more students to study either side of the border

Fine Gael strongly supports the recommendations of the report carried out by Professor Pól O Dochartaigh to reform how A-levels are converted to CAO points. Admissions policies are a matter for the universities

themselves, but Fine Gael will do what it can to assist in this regard. We hope that revisions will be in place for students looking to start their studies in September 2024.

We have forged really important bonds with partners in Northern Ireland to help improve access to education and research. For example, in February the Government announced a new partnership with Queen’s University in Belfast, recognising the importance of increasing healthcare graduates across both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. Between the expansion in places in the six medical schools in Ireland and the new places at Queen’s, by September 2024 we will have delivered a more than 25% increase in places for students compared to 2021.

Building Alliances in Europe

Ireland has lost a natural ally at EU meetings because of Brexit. Fine Gael is working to build new alliances in the European Parliament and through the EPP to achieve our goals, including on the single market, competitiveness, EU competition laws, innovation, and investment.

On a range of issues from agriculture to taxation to strategic autonomy, to security, to climate action and to the recognition of Palestine, Ireland is working with like-minded EU Member States to guide the EU position.

FIRM AND FAIR MIGRATION

Ireland will maintain a migration system that is firm, fair and enforced and we will do so in accordance with international law and fundamental rights. Migration is an unprecedented challenge, but we will meet it by remaining united and taking comprehensive action every day.

Taoiseach Simon Harris is ensuring we break down silos or “not-my-problem” attitudes to ensure all state agencies and communities are working together. At a European level, we must also work together. Acting alone just doesn’t make sense. That is why we are signing up to the European Union Migration Pact to ensure Europe acts together on migration. This is a European-wide deal which imposes statutory timelines for the processing of applications and allows for the return of applicants more quickly because Ireland cannot do this on its own.

We cannot and should not lose sight of the benefits of migration. Our economy is built on being open: we need workers in all sectors like agriculture, in our health service and to build homes. In all, 66,000 people have permits allowing them to work here — 21,000 of those are caring for our families in hospitals or minding our elderly in nursing homes.

Having once called for an expansion of our asylum system and an increase in the number of refugees we accept, Sinn Féin are distributing leaflets to households calling for an end to open borders. We won’t play politics on migration. We will focus on taking swift action in the best interests of all people in Ireland.

New Pact on Migration and Asylum

After years of difficult negotiations, we have now agreed a new Pact on Migration and Asylum. This is the biggest overhaul of Migration rules in decades and we are backing it.

The Pact will:

• Ensure migration and asylum is managed to ensure the system is fair, efficient and coherent.

• Allow significantly faster processing of international protection applications.

• Reduce secondary movements of applicants, reduce the number of applications we have to process, reduce the time people spend in State provided accommodation, and make the return of those not entitled to protection much more efficient.

• Speed up the processing of asylum applications so that people in need of our protection get it quickly and those who don’t are returned to their country of origin efficiently.

• Save money in the long run, due to the reduced need to house asylum seekers.

It will take some time to implement this Pact in Ireland and we need to get that right, with the input of communities and everyone involved. We will ensure it’s a firmer system. Those who need our help will get it, but those who are not entitled to come to this country will get a decision quickly and will leave quickly as well.

We will repeal the International Protection Act 2015 and replace it with new legislation to provide for faster processing, better screening and more efficient returns, as provided for in the Pact.

Fine Gael will:

• Implement the new Pact on Migration and Asylum and establish a migration system that is firm but fair.

Faster processing times

Getting through applications faster is a key lever we control. We have doubled the number of people working in the International Protection Office. Minister Helen McEntee is taking action to free up 100 more gardaí from desk duties to work on enforcement, including deportations. A tender is also due to issue shortly to provide for charter flights to return unsuccessful international protection applicants. People being granted asylum in Ireland will know sooner and people denied will leave sooner. This system works. Since introducing fast-processing, the number of people applying from safe countries has halved. Applicants are receiving their first instance decision in around 3 months. It gives protection quickly to those who need it, while also demonstrating to applicants who don’t need it that there is nothing to gain from going down the asylum route.

Since April, the International Protection Office is accelerating the processing of applicants from the country of origin with the highest number of applications in the previous three months. This new measure is in addition to those currently prioritised and accelerated under the safe country of origin list.

Fine Gael will:

• Speed up asylum applications and actively monitor the Safe Country of Origin List.

• Continue to increase resources at all stages in the International Protection system.

Agreements with Third Countries

As part of the European People’s Party, we will support EU legislation to provide for the processing of asylum applications in safe third countries. Under these proposals, an EU Member State could provide that anyone applying for asylum in that country could also be transferred to a safe third country and undergo the asylum process there. Any such agreements would be

in line with the core obligations of the Geneva Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.

Our approach will always treat people with dignity and respect, informed by the protection of human rights. Those who need help will get it.

Better engagement with communities

We will move away from the emergency use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. It’s simply unacceptable that the only functioning hotel in a town can be taken away from a community overnight.

We need to do better and to listen to people. The Irish people want to play their part and we will work to create a system that helps them do that.

While we work to increase accommodation places for migrants, we will not allow encampments to bed in for months again. It is unsafe and against the law. We are working now to stand up more facilities quickly on state land. We cannot allow any more unnecessary delays in making state land available for accommodation.

MAKING EUROPE COMPETITIVE – PROMOTING ENTERPRISE AND INNOVATION

An ambitious and fair EU Trade Policy

Ireland is a pro-enterprise, free trade economy. We believe it is in Ireland’s interests to maintain and strengthen that economic model in Europe and the rest of the world. However, this model is under threat. In the face of increased subsidies in the US and China, there is momentum in parts of Europe towards subsidising certain industries and businesses. This could damage the level playing field of the Single Market and lead to distortions between member states. One of the core principles of EU membership is fair competition and a level playing field across the continent. Strategic autonomy should not mean more tariffs, subsidies and protectionism. We believe the State can prompt investment and stimulate growth, but innovation is best left to our entrepreneurs, our researchers and our inventors.

We need to be quicker at agreeing new trade deals. We stand for an ambitious, outward-looking trade model while ensuring that imports meet the high standards we demand of our own farmers/producers.

Fine Gael will:

• Push for an ambitious and open EU trade agenda.

• Work with like-minded countries to safeguard the principles of EU economic policy, based on competitiveness, innovation and a level-playing field.

• Promote an open, multilateral, rules-based trade system.

• Promote new Free Trade Agreements, ensuring proper assurances are in place in regard to sustainability and human rights.

• The Mercosur deal cannot progress until concerns in regard to additional climate and environmental

provisions and an adequate economic assessment are addressed.

Single Market

The Single Market is the beating heart of the EU for the last 30 years. It facilitates the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. It promotes competition among businesses based on an agreed set of rules and it gives choice to consumers, breaking down barriers. While much has been achieved, the Single Market remains an unfinished project. Not only do we need to adapt to new advances in the digital or green economy, we need to get back to basics on the Single Market and ensure its founding principles are upheld.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to complete the Single Market and unleash its potential.

• Ensure the original objectives of the Single Market – to facilitate the free movement of people, goods, services and capital – are maintained.

Capital Markets Union

The EU requires massive investments to address the green and digital transitions and the demands of an aging population. These investments must assist our competitiveness and allow for the growth of new and emerging industries. The scale of the investment is such that public funding will not be sufficient and a renewed focus is required to encourage private investment in our future.

We need to boost our capital markets union and unlock sources of private financing to deliver on our ambitions.

SMEs and farmers in Ireland are heavily reliant on bank financing and can be reluctant to take on debt or to issue equity. Banks can either refuse funding or take a conservative approach, leaving SMEs short of finance. We need to borrow from the US model and think more about seed capital, venture capital and private equity. We also need to consolidate the fragmented nature of the European equity market and make it simpler for SMEs to access.

Too many EU companies, including Irish companies, move out of the EU when they reach a certain size, moving to the US to avail of a deeper, more liquid capital market. Europe needs more innovative companies to remain in the EU as they scale-up. This requires accessing funds from capital markets.

Today we do not have a single market when it comes to capital. Barriers to the free flow of capital in the Single Market must be removed and replaced by a system that works better for businesses, investors and savers.

We will work to advance the Single Market for Capital. This will create better opportunities for companies, small and large, to access finance and opportunities for citizens to save, invest and plan for retirement by facilitating greater access to capital markets for retail investors.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to advance Capital Markets Union (CMU).

• Work to maintain good relations with capital markets in London and make the best use of the EU-UK forum for discussion on financial services.

• Work to diversify financing options for SMEs to secure their future in the EU and this competitiveness globally.

• Work to enable a new, safe environment for people to invest in and build up financial independence, especially when it comes to long term financial instruments such as pensions.

• Work to provide access to lower-cost financing for SMEs and start-ups.

• Look for ways to grow the Irish Stock Exchange as a source of equity and growth for indigenous business.

Banking Union

Banks have a crucial role to play in financing the investment needed for our green and digital future. The banking union was established in the aftermath of the

financial crisis, to ensure that banks can withstand any future financial crises and non-viable banks are resolved without using taxpayers’ money.

Completing the banking union requires four steps: establishing a common European safety net for depositors to complement national schemes; promoting diversification of banks’ sovereign exposures; improving the management of failing banks; and creating the conditions for a true single market for banking services.

Today Irish consumers do not have access to financial products, including loans from European banks. Completing the Banking Union would increase competition and provide greater choice to Irish businesses and consumers.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to complete the banking union to the benefit of consumers and businesses.

The future of Cash and Digital Euro

Consumers and businesses are more and more digital, yet cash remains important. We welcome EU Commission proposals to ensure the legal tender status of cash, to ensure its availability and acceptability in making payments. Digital payment methods are a complement to cash - not a replacement for bank notes and coins.

The ECB and the EU Commission are working on launching a digital euro, backed by Europe’s central banks. This would be a central bank digital eurocurrency and an electronic equivalent to cash. It would complement banknotes and coins, giving people an additional choice when purchasing goods and services.

We believe that it would bolster Europe’s financial resilience and competitiveness. It would enable all citizens to make payments anywhere in the euro area and at all times in safe, sovereign money, issued by the ECB. As it would be backed by a central bank, the digital euro would be transferable into cash unlike a so called crypto-currencies asset, which provides no such guarantee.

The debate on a digital euro will advance with the European Parliament playing a key role. We need to make

sure consumers are well informed, that their privacy is protected and they have confidence in the concept of a digital euro.

Fine Gael will:

• Back plans for a digital euro to give more choice to consumers, provided legitimate concerns such as privacy are addressed.

• Ensure continued acceptance of and access to cash.

Corporation Tax

Ireland’s corporate tax regime is a vital component of our foreign direct investment offering and we will work resolutely to defend it. We will resist any attempts to harmonise corporate tax or any tangential moves to do so. We have signed up to the OECD global framework for corporate tax as we believe it is important that we are part of this wider agreement. However, we have done so while still protecting tax sovereignty.

Fine Gael will:

• Strongly defend Ireland’s Corporate Tax regime.

• Insist that Irish tax policy will continue to be set in Ireland.

Late Payment Directive

The EU is looking to strengthen the existing Directive on late payments with a new regulation. It is designed to improve payment discipline of public authorities, large companies and SMEs, while protecting businesses, especially smaller businesses, from late payments. Bigger companies have better bargaining power when it comes to payments and it makes sense to strengthen the hand of smaller companies. Cash flow is vital to smaller companies and it is estimated that one in four bankruptcies are due to invoices not being paid on time. This new regulation will tighten up the rules and adjust the balance of power.

Fine Gael will:

• Prioritise the early adoption of the Late Payments Directive once the new Parliament is re-elected, ensuring steady cash flow for small businesses.

• Ensure that small businesses are given special status or a derogation so that this measure benefits them.

Reducing the regulatory burden for SMEs

As part of the recent package for small business, Taoiseach Simon Harris and Minister Peter Burke committed to implementing an enhanced SME Test. This test ensures any major proposal coming to Government must be assessed for its impact on small and medium-sized businesses.

The European Commission has committed to reducing the burden of regulation for business by 25%. This is a welcome development and should focus efforts on streamlining regulations. Regulation is important to provide legal certainty to businesses and consumers, but it can also stymie companies from making investments. We will work with our EU partners to identify areas where regulation has become excessive and needs to be cut.

Fine Gael will:

• Advocate that new EU laws are only passed if they are needed and minimise additional regulations on small business. SMEs should be exempt from any new laws, where appropriate. Implementation of existing EU legislation should be the priority for the coming five years.

• Work to step up use of the SME Test at European level to ensure new laws always take SMEs into consideration.

Trade Sanctions

The EU has adopted 13 packages of sanctions against Russia in response to its illegal invasion of Ukraine and a 14th package is under consideration. Full implementation of these sanctions is essential to have the desired effect. Circumvention of sanctions through third countries or through other means, persist and this is not good enough.

Fine Gael will:

• Work with our EU partners to close loopholes and tighten up the implementation of sanctions.

Ireland needs to send radical socialist voices to the European Parliament to challenge the hypocrisy and double standards. As socialists, we have no illusion that a few MEP’s can change its undemocratic structures, but we can expose the power of corporate lobbyists and backroom dealings. We will help to expose the rigged economy, which sees billionaires get richer, while the workers who actually create the wealth get poorer.

We can be a socialist voice that presses for real solidarity with Palestine. We can call out the double standards when the EU gives €26 billion in military supplies to Ukraine but, behind its show of ‘concern’ for Palestine, backs Israel to the hilt.

We can expose the hypocrisy of EU claims to be a ‘progressive’ body that promotes inclusion and diversity. We will demand to know why 29,250 people had to drown in the Mediterranean so that ‘fortress Europe’ could be preserved.

We live in an era where our planet is threatened by an escalating climate catastrophe. Despite all the greenwashing from big business and the volumes of speeches by the establishment parties’, global temperatures reached their highest ever recorded level in 2023. Green parties who were once prominent in highlighting environmental destruction are now part of the political establishment. They have embraced the very neoliberal measures that make it impossible to control runaway temperatures.

People Before Profit offer an alternative eco-socialist voice that will challenge the destructive logic of capitalism and fight to save our planet.

A RIGGED SYSTEM

We Want Equality and Social Rights – Not a Billionaires Club

Europe is a grossly unequal continent. There are nearly 600 billionaires who hire lobbyists, meet with top politicians, and sometimes use economic blackmail to get their way.

By contrast there are 95 million people at risk of poverty or social exclusion. That is nearly a quarter of the population.

A Rigged Economy

The richest 10 percent have more wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined.

The top 20 percent have 60 times the wealth of the bottom 20 percent. Europe’s 600 billionaires own more than the poorest 80 million families combined.

Our MP’s will fight to make Europe a more equal place for workers and those in need.

The same massive inequality is mirrored in Ireland. We are told that we live in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but working people face greater insecurity than ever before. Most people work longer hours without feeling any benefit, and young people, in particular, face precariousness and being locked out of affordable home ownership.

We are supposed to be going forwards – but most people are going backwards.

How has all this happened and what role does the EU play in increasing inequality?

The truth is that the EU is a rigged system that protects the wealthy. Here is how it works:

• The competition rules of the European Single Market (ESM) have created a race to the bottom for workers’ wages and corporate taxes. During the 1960’s

workers were paid 65 percent of the total income of the EU economy but today this is less than 55 percent. During the 1980’s the average corporation tax rate in Europe was 50 percent, but today it is just 21 percent.

• The EU issues directives which promote privatization. Irish electricity is a classic example. In 1996, the EU issued a directive on electricity ‘liberalisation’. Before this, the ESB provided some of the cheapest electricity for domestic users in Europe. But ‘liberalisation’ was a code word for privatisation. These directives led to the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, which was enacted in 2001. It radically changed the mandate of the ESB and turned it into a for-profit company. The result is dearer electricity for domestic users. We are charged €1,000 more for electricity every year than the European average and

• The EU elite have used economic crises to prop up the rich. After the financial

crash of 2008, the EU demanded that Irish taxpayers put billions into Irish banks. ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, threatened that a ‘bomb would go off in Dublin’ if the wealthy bondholders were not bailed out. Later the EU embarked on a policy of ‘quantitative easing.’ This meant printing cheap money and allowing bankers and developers to borrow cheaply. The rich used this easy money to invest heavily in property and jack up rents and house prices.

Did You Know?

In 2011 The President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, threatened a financial bomb in Dublin if Irish taxpayers failed to pay back banks in Europe. Irish taxpayers were then forced to pay 42 percent of the entire cost of the European banking crisis even though Ireland only had 1 percent of the population.

People Before Profit has a proud record of opposing this financial austerity.

• Under EU rules public spending is restricted. EU bureaucrats look at statistics to determine if a country is spending more than 60 percent of its GDP or running a small deficit of more than 3 percent. Governments must submit their proposed budget to see if there are ‘imbalances’. A complex language that is virtually inaccessible to the general public is deployed to limit and curtail public spending. Yet the people who rely most on public spending are working people. They send their children to publicly funded schools. They use public hospitals. They need basic services to help them.

All of this means that working people have lost out badly. The numbers in trade unions are falling constantly (today it is just under 25 percent) and, as a result, low pay, insecure jobs, and poor pension provision has increased. Workers must now work until the age of 66 before they receive a state pension, and it could go higher. In every country there is a wage-productivity gap – workers are producing far more but their wages are falling behind as a share of national wealth. At the same time costs are increasing. This is most obvious in housing and the recent cost of living crisis.

HOW A NEOLIBERAL EU

IS BLOWING UP THE HOUSING

CRISIS AND THE COST OF LIVING

• EU laws guarantee freedom of movement for capital, which has enabled vulture funds to buy up vast swathes of property across Europe and drive up housing costs in the name of profit. Governments are forbidden by EU rules from

“discriminating” against foreign capital no matter how much damage the vultures do.

• The European Central Bank has repeatedly hiked up mortgage interest rates,

driving mortgage holders and their families into poverty and making it impossible for young workers to buy a home. If you have a mortgage, the EU is costing you thousands of euros a year in higher interest rates.

• The EU’s public procurement and state aid rules make it extremely difficult for states to directly build social and affordable housing. Local authorities are

forced to put housing projects out to tender so companies can compete to provide the housing for the lowest price. The state aid rules prevent states from favouring direct build by councils or a state construction company and the public procurement rules force state agencies to compete with private companies paying lower wages. This drives down pay and conditions for construction workers. The tender process causes long delays to new housing and delays can be even longer if companies use EU competition laws to challenge tender decisions in the courts.

• The EU is refusing to regulate short term lets even though there are thousands more homes on AirBnB than are available for workers to rent.

Did You Know?

Ireland has the highest cost of living in Europe. According to Eurostat, Irish costs are currently 46 percent higher than the EU average. Ireland also has the highest cost for housing in the EU. According to Eurostat, Irish people pay 92 percent more housing when electricity and other fuels are factored in. This is driven by vulture funds who buy up land and houses and by a government that won’t build enough social and affordable housing.

Our MEP’s will fight for better wages and cheaper houses. This means reducing the profits of big business.

People Before Profit MEPs will:

• Support workers across the continent for greater rights. Whenever workers are in struggle, we will promote solidarity action across borders.

• Demand an end to the austerity agenda. We want to increase public spending to create better public services for working people. We reject the straitjacket of EU fiscal rules.

• Fight for a national construction company to build enough social and affordable homes.

• Promote the nationalisation of the energy sector to produce cheap energy and allow for a green transition.

• Advocate for a billionaires’ tax and a ‘Robin Hood Tax’ on finance to fund our public services.

• Instead of directives that lead to privatisation, we want directives that give people social rights. EU countries should be required to make provision for social housing, to provide adequate standards of care, to increase spending on the public health system.

• Demand an EU-wide ban on vulture funds and an end to total freedom of movement for capital, which is driving up housing costs and making people homelessness.

It is time to share the wealth – and end inequality.

END EU HYPOCRISY ON THE CLIMATE

We are hurtling towards a 2-degree increase in global warming, yet despite all the talk, the EU is not taking decisive action and refuses to set a date to phase out fossil fuels. The EU is not on track to achieve its existing target to reduce emissions by “at least 55%” by 2030.

This parliament will be the key forum for holding elites to their promise to move to zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The EU presents itself as a moral leader on climate change. But behind the PR wrapping there is a darker side that involves concessions being made to business interests.

The EU Commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, has openly stated that the EU’s climate ambitions must not interfere with “making sure our businesses stay competitive’. Hoekstra began his career at Shell and worked for 11 years at the McKinsey consultancy company that has represented fossil fuel interests.

It is no surprise that the EU’s plan places a major emphasis on carbon capture and storage with recent proposals from the Commission calling for a “rapid scale-up” of carbon removal techniques. This has become the main greenwashing tactic of the fossil fuel industry despite being a completely unproven technology. In its current capacity, it is only responsible for a 0.1 percent reduction in global annual emissions. 81 percent of carbon captured to date has been used to extract more oil via the process of Enhanced Oil Recovery.

Did You Know?

Despite overwhelming scientific evidence there have been more Co2 emissions since 1990 than in the entire period before that date. One reason is the power of the oil and gas companies. The war in Ukraine has been a disaster for ordinary people but an enormous help to corporate profits.

In the two years from February 2022-2024, the worlds five biggest fossil fuel companies – BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies – made combined profits of $281 billion. This creates enormous power for companies that have no interest in clean energies.

Our MEP’s will fight to reduce the lobbying power of big oil companies.

The EU claims that it is also encouraging farmers to protect the environment. But it has failed to provide a just transition that would allow them to move away from harmful practices such as massively increasing the size of the dairy herd or act as custodians of the environment.

The EU bureaucracy use the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as its main instrument. But for decades, around 80 percent of CAP subsidies have gone go to just 20 percent of

the €400 billion will continue to be spent on Agri-industrial business-as-usual farming.

Small and medium farmers are forced to make the largest adjustments while the big Agri businesses continue to squeeze their livelihoods and demand a productivist model. Our MEP’s will advocate for farmers who need extensive financial support to improve their emissions. They also need higher margins so that they can reduce their production and their emissions.

Despite green rhetoric, globalised food chains will lead to further industrialisation of European agriculture, destroying the most sustainable models.

The Green Parties have totally failed. They join governments that advocate neoliberal policies and increasingly support more military spending.

People Before Profit MEPs will demand:

• More food sovereignty and an end to monocultural farming.

• A reduction in dairy herds and a just transition for small and medium farmers.

• Public ownership of major agribusinesses to organise a just transition.

• Free public transport throughout the EU, including proper public transport for smaller towns.

• Restoration of the rail infrastructure, including the carrying of freight.

• An EU ruling that no country should devote more than 5 percent of its energy supplies to data centres.

• A replacement for CAP so that farmers’ funding is a public good for custodians of the land, including a fully funded Nature Restoration Fund and Afforestation & Rewilding programmes offering farmers €3,000 per annum per hectare.

• European-wide ‘right to repair’.

• A Europe Wide Retrofitting programme that pays for the initial costs upfront and receives money back from the energy savings overtime.

• European-wide ban on private jets and fossil fuel advertising.

• EU support for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty.

• A four day week to reduce transport emissions and improve quality of lie.

• A just transition so that the rich pay for the emissions they have created and made money from – not the poor.

People Before Profit want every small and medium farmer to regain control from the major supermarket and food processors. One way to do this is pay them for environmental action. In Europe we would argue for a fund that would pay farmers €3000 every year if they agree to use the land to reduce emissions.

AN EU THAT SUPPORTS PALESTINE AND STOPS MILITARISATION

The EU has stood on the wrong side of history on Palestine. Ursula von der Leyen has publicly stated that ‘Israel has the right to self-defence …the EU stands by Israel today and in the next weeks.’

Israel’s so called ‘right to self-defence’ has led to over 30,000 Palestinian deaths. At no point has the EU President ever spoken of a Palestinian right to self-defence against the illegal occupation of their land.

The EU talks a lot about human rights – but when it comes to Palestine it does not promote them. Instead, EU research funding supports Israeli armaments companies.

EU leaders are also preparing for a new war. Admiral Rob Bauer, a NATO military committee chief, has openly declared that the West should prepare for all-out war with Russia within the next 20 years.

EU leaders constantly talk about the Russian threat and the need to build up defence spending. Arms spending in Europe is now at the highest point since the Cold War, as each government commits to spending at least 2 percent of its GDP on defence. The EU is so eager to promote an arms race that it has included a special exception for military spending in new EU fiscal rule proposals.

This also helps to explain why Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael want to push us to join NATO or an EU army. They want to end our neutrality. They have taken the first step by agreeing to join PESCO, a programme that insists that Irish military spending must grow fivefold.

Did You Know?

European countries have rapidly increased spending on the military. In 2022 they spent €240 billion on military equipment – the eight year of increases. Eradicating child poverty for the 25 million children affected would cost considerably less (€150 billion) but EU policy makers increasingly prefer to fund warfare not welfare. Our MEP’s would fight to reverse these policies and these priorities.

People Before Profit MEPs will demand:

• Irish neutrality as a core plank of our foreign policy.

• Exiting PESCO and resisting all attempts to build an EU Army.

• Welfare not warfare. Stop the subsidies to the arms industry and the massive waste of money on the war in Ukraine. Invest in public services and promote peace not war.

• End the drive towards militarisation and increased arms spending. No to an EU army,

• Support the people of Ukraine by cancelling debts held by European banks.

• Expel Israel from all trade agreements with the EU – support the right of Palestinians to resist illegal occupation.

RACISM FIGHT FASCISM

Fascist forces have re-emerged in Europe to spread a message of hate against asylum seekers and migrants. They seek to turn working people on each other rather than fight an upper class that exploits us all.

Their methods are lies and fear mongering. But in their pursuit of votes, mainstream centre-right political parties bend and appease them.

Having slashed public services, and allowed rampant profiteering, right-wing governments across Europe are now trying to put the blame on migrants and refugees for the housing, health, and cost of living crises. They want working people to fight each other for the measly crumbs from the table that we get, rather than fighting for better services for all. This has helped to fan the flames of a small, violent fascist movement who are terrorising working class and migrant communities and must be stopped.

People Before Profit rejects this ‘dog eat dog’ competition. Instead, we fight for jobs, homes, and health care for all - and let’s tax the billionaires and corporate elite to fund it. Rather than a bitter fight over who gets a medical card, and who doesn’t - we stand for an Irish NHS for all.

Did You Know?

Ireland has always benefitted from people moving across borders. Irish people are among the top 10 globally who emigrate to find work and Ireland has the second highest portion of its population living in other EU countries.

Going the other way, migrants make a vital contribution to Irish society and the Irish economy. They keep our hospitals running and contribute more to the economy in taxes and PRSI than they receive in public services or social welfare.

Rather than attacking people who desperately need housing and public services we stand for genuine solidarity and enough investment to meet the needs of all who live here.

Irish people have shown again and again just how welcoming we are. We know what it is like to be driven from your home by poverty, famine, and imperialism. We know that every new person that comes here can be a source of new wealth, new workers for our health and education services, new life, and vibrancy for our country - just like Irish emigrants added hugely to the countries we travelled to. But to make that a reality, we need investment in jobs, housing, and integration.

The EU needs more migrants not less. There are not enough workers to carry out basic tasks or fund the pensions of older generations. That’s one reason why we reject

Mediterranean and EU funding for brutal regimes in Turkey, Libya and elsewhere to lock up people in inhumane camps for the ‘crime’ of seeking a better life. Europe needs more, not less, search and rescue missions to save people from drowning.

Did You Know?

Nearly 30,000 people have been allowed to drown in the Mediterranean. In 2019, all four Fine Gael MEP’s - Mairead McGuinness, Maria Walsh, Frances Fitzgerald, and Sean Kelly voted against a resolution that would have increased search and rescue missions for people in danger of drowning. The resolution lost by two votes.

Our MEP’s will fight for a fairer Europe that cares for those in need inside and outside the EU.

People Before Profit stand for:

• Giving all asylum seekers that come to Europe an immediate right to work, with full legal, social and trade union rights.

• Fighting trade unions to organise workers of all nationalities against the race to the bottom and for decent wages and conditions.

• An end to EU bribes for countries to detain migrants.

• Tax the rich to fund mass investment to provide jobs, homes, and quality public services for all.

FOR A DEMOCRATIC & ECO-SOCIALIST EUROPE END THE RULE OF BUREAUCRACY.

The EU is organised in ways that prevent democratic pressure. No member of the EU Parliament can propose legislation. Very few people are aware of EU discussions which lead to directives which affect their lives. The EU’s legislative process involves countless meetings in shadowy ‘trilogues’ which hammer out deals.

This undemocratic form of decision-making suits corporate interests. There are over 25,000 lobbyists in Brussels, and many have privileged access to EU Commissioners. More than 75 percent of all lobby meetings with these Commissioners are with lobbyists of big business.

On top of this form of influence peddling, there is a revolving door pattern. One third of Commissioners leaving in 2014 went into industry lobbying jobs.

This lack of democracy explains why People Before Profit is an EU critical party. We reject the Tory Brexit option as it implies a withdrawal from the EU to further strengthen business interests and to stir up racist fears of immigration.

We are internationalists who want a genuinely democratic Europe that can only arise from the struggles of working people across the continent.

In the meantime, we openly assert that the democratic wishes of the Irish people, must take precedence over any bureaucratic directives from Brussels. Specifically, if the Irish electorate vote to re-nationalise energy or the banks, or launch a serious programme of building public housing, then no EU directive can prevent this occurring.

If elected to the EU Parliament, People Before Profit MEPs will.

• Call for a ban on corporate lobbyists – we want to clear the money people from the temple of decision making.

• Expose all the back room manoeuvring that gives support to the arms industry or big business.

• Fight for power to the people. Reject neoliberal authoritarianism and the EU fiscal rules.

• Assert the primacy of Irish law over EU directives.

Introduction

Last year Ireland marked half a century of participation in the European project.

Membership of the EU has been a rich source of progress for Ireland, from the transformative social changes to the roads and other infrastructure that European funding has helped to build.

The integration of elements of European law into Irish law has brought social progress that we may have had to wait much longer to see initiated, or which may not have happened at all.

Significant economic benefits have accrued to Ireland too. Most notably, access to the Single Market and various structural funds did much to assist our infrastructural development at a time when the Irish economy was something of a poor relation in Europe.

We believe EU membership and shared European values are central to our national interests and provide Ireland with a platform to actively promote our foreign policy objectives within a European bloc of friendly nations.

The European Parliament has long been an important part of Irish democracy. As we seek solutions to the climate catastrophe, housing crisis, the growth of artificial intelligence and the rise of far-right politics, it is more important than ever that we send strong voices to Brussels who will fight for progressive values and policies.

Our MEPs will work to safeguard democracy and the rule of law, and promote a progressive vision for Europe; a Social Europe, based around the principles of fairness, equality, human rights, protection for workers, and high environmental standards, with a stronger role for the State to counterbalance the market and to better regulate the economy.

We will endeavour, through the processes and institutions of the EU, to deepen cooperation among member states in the pursuit of peace, prosperity, social justice, and well-being for all EU citizens.

Climate and Nature

The next five years will be crucial for the planet and those of us who inhabit it. Electing Social Democrat MEPs would ensure a stronger voice on climate action in Brussels over that five-year term.

Real coordination at EU-level is essential to allow member states to meet their climate obligations. The European Union must be a global leader on climate action if we are to have any hope of securing a liveable planet.

Years of climate denial and delay have left us in a situation where a fast transition to a carbon-free society is the only option on the table. Already, an increasing number of severe weather events including fires, floods and droughts are afflicting the EU and world at large.

The EU’s 2030 climate target is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent (relative to 1990). In February 2024, the European Commission recommended reducing the EU’s emissions by 90 per cent by 2040. Reducing net emissions in this way will put us on course towards climate neutrality by 2050.

We need a continent-wide energy system based fully on renewables in the next two decades. EU support funding for the development of clean, sustainable and affordable energy, including community wind and solar energy projects at a local level, will be imperative if we are to succeed. Investing in a cleaner greener economy and rapidly reducing fossil fuel dependence will strengthen European security and climate resilience.

We must work to restore natural habitats and biodiversity as set out in the Nature Restoration Law. Action on climate change must be combined with action on ecosystem preservation. The EU also has a role in improving air quality standards across the continent.

We need to ensure that the EU leads by example internationally on climate justice and action to protect nature. Europe has proven that it can bring back species from the brink of extinction, clean up rivers, and protect habitats. But success will ultimately depend on who is elected to the European Parliament.

It is therefore important that Ireland sends to Brussels MEPs that will take the climate crisis seriously. The Social Democrats’ voting record in the Dáil on this

issue shows how seriously we take this, unlike many other Irish parties in Dublin and in Brussels.

We will also work to ensure that this green transformation is not done at the expense of social cohesion. Climate adaption that leaves people and regions behind has the potential to ensure the entire project fails.

Most of all, our MEPs will work to ensure the creation of, and support for, EUlevel strategies for the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by the end of the decade, working for a fast, fair and just transition to a sustainable economy that supports decent work and operates within planetary boundaries.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Work to ensure that all policy decisions prioritise people, their communities, and the environment.

Lobby for rapid emissions legislation and emissions reduction targets in line with scientific recommendations.

Work to bring forward the EU’s climate neutrality target and a commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions as early as possible.

Support EU-level strategies for the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by the end of the decade.

Push to include the right to a clean environment in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Work to restore natural habitats and biodiversity as set out in the Nature Restoration Law. Action on climate change must be combined with action on ecosystem preservation.

Push the EU to build an energy system based fully on renewables by 2040, and ensure energy projects are developed in a way that minimises their impact on nature.

Seek additional EU support and funding for the development of clean, sustainable and affordable energy, including wind and solar power.

Support further regulation, as well as technical and financial support, for the development of Community Energy initiatives at local level.

Such formats increase support for renewable energy projects, whilst giving tangible benefits for individuals, families and communities.

Support green hydrogen as an ‘alternative’ fuel reserved for backup in the power system, heavy industry, and long-distance transport (both sea and air) where full electrification may not yet be feasible.

Acknowledge the tax-free status of aviation and maritime fuel as what it is: an effective subsidy for both industries that should be factored into economic analyses of the costs and impacts of the industry.

We will call for the reversal of the Energy Taxation Directive, which prevents the taxation of aviation and maritime fuel.

Oppose public money, at State and European level, for infrastructure that would further lock the continent into fossil fuel dependency.

Seek the increased regulation of the financial industry within the EU so to reduce and eliminate money flows supporting the fossil fuel industry.

Recently published research shows that European banks have provided more than €300 billion of financing to fossil fuel and agribusiness activities in the Global South in the years since the Paris Agreement.

Push for a minimum percentage of public money being spent to meet the ‘green financing’ classification.

Support an EU endorsement of the need for a global Fossil Fuel NonProliferation Treaty; a global agreement to phase out fossil fuels.

Support the principle of ‘the polluter pays’ – ensuring that such measures

are done in a socially fair way – and advocate for the funds raised to directly assist transition.

Push for improved air quality standards at European level.

Strengthen regulations and enforcement to fight marine pollution, including chemical and plastic pollution.

Make the discarding of waste directly into the ocean unlawful in EU Territorial waters.

Seek additional funding for the EU Solidarity Fund, to focus on the green transition and also help prepare for natural disasters.

Acknowledge that while EU-level funding and direction is important, so too is allowance for the green transition to be shaped and led at more local levels; national, regional, and municipal.

Workers’ Rights

The Social Democrats want to help create a Social Europe; an EU where workers’ rights are respected, workers are properly paid for their work, and workers and families have a better work/life balance.

For decades, the share of national income going to workers has been declining across the continent. As employment has become more precarious, the number of working poor in the European economy is on the rise.

The Social Democrats are focused on empowering workers through supporting the growth of trade unions and improving workers’ rights legislation, at home and at a European level. These are some of the most powerful tools we have for reducing economic inequality.

Strengthening workers’ rights is fundamental to social democratic politics.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Work to defend and strengthen trade union and workers’ rights, including the right to organise, union access to workplaces, the right to bargain collectively, and the right to strike.

Fight for legislation recognising platform workers as employees, with a right to a minimum wage, collective bargaining, and employment conditions/protections to which workers are legally entitled.

Seek to build on the European Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions, so that workers in precarious work or in bogus self-employment arrangements have better protections.

Support the unionisation of new or non-standard forms of work to guarantee the rights of all workers.

Work to revise EU procurement rules so that organisations that respect workers’ and trade union rights are favoured.

Encourage the EU to take stronger action to eliminate the gender pay gap, including by ensuring swift transposition across the EU of the Directive on Gender Pay Transparency.

Seek to make easier the recognition of professional qualifications across the bloc.

Aim to build on the European Directive on work/life balance, including enhancing flexibility around working hours to allow families to manage caring responsibilities.

Work to expand EU occupational health and safety legislation, and support efforts across the EU to introduce a four-day working week.

Migration

Migration has the potential to benefit all of society, including by mitigating labour shortages (a significant economic challenge in many EU countries) and enriching cultures and communities.

Across the world, refugees are desperately fleeing conflict, persecution, or hunger. Many are looking towards Europe for sanctuary but tragically many men, women and children are drowning in the Mediterranean, while those who do make it to EU soil often do not receive the reception they are entitled to.

People seeking safety and protection increasingly face detention, brutal and illegal pushbacks, and violence at the hands of smugglers and border authorities.

EU countries have ended their search and rescue missions. Often, humanitarian ships that have rescued refugees and migrants from dangerous boats have been blocked from docking at EU ports.

Across the continent, far-right elements exploit this suffering, dragging mainstream parties to the right and normalising migration policies that are both dysfunctional and unsustainable.

The failure of EU countries to prevent refugees from drowning and to provide safe and legal pathways to asylum is a disgrace. In October 2019, Fine Gael MEPs voted against a European Parliament resolution calling for improved search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean to save refugees from drowning. (The resolution was defeated by just two votes.)

At the European Parliament, our MEPs will work to strengthen safe, legal and regular migration pathways, and enhance rights, protections and supports for migrants and asylum seekers within the EU.

The establishment of legal and accessible migration channels is necessary to end suffering and exploitation, including through human trafficking. We need a migration code that provides visa opportunities for family reunification and work at different skills levels. We want to make it easier for newcomers to the EU to work and integrate through access to language support, education and employment opportunities.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Work to strengthen safe, legal and regular migration pathways, and to enhance rights, protections and supports for asylum seekers within the EU.

Oppose border externalisation policies, as well as multi- and bi-lateral agreements with states that are considered unsafe, do not resect human rights, or do not comply with the rule of law.

Oppose so-called “migration deals”, with third countries, where the EU essentially pays other countries to keep out migrants, unless there has been a thorough human rights assessment.

Making development cooperation with third countries conditional on so-called ‘migration management’ is unethical. Refugees and asylum seekers are among the most vulnerable people in our societies, we cannot allow them to be exploited for geopolitical gain.

Call for an EU-funded Search & Rescue Missions in the Mediterranean, and aim to strengthen the humanitarian mandate of Frontex.

The EU should have an explicit goal to save lives in the Mediterranean.

Fight for an end to laws that have effectively criminalised the provision of humanitarian assistance to asylum seekers.

Work for a migration code that provides visa opportunities for family reunification and work at different skills levels.

We want to make it easier for newcomers to work and integrate through access to language support, education and employment opportunities.

Defence, Neutrality, and Foreign Policy

We believe EU membership and shared European values are central to our national interests and provide Ireland with a platform to actively promote our foreign policy objectives within a European bloc of friendly nations.

Our interactions with the nations of the world in an era of increasing globalisation is a critical element in sustaining Ireland’s security, and in contributing to our economic growth and the prosperity for our people. No country can face the prevailing security threats alone.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Promote our values of an inclusive, fair and just society with dignity, respect and equality for all citizens; values which define who we are as both a nation and a people.

Advocate for Ireland’s military neutrality and safeguard our opt-outs from EU common defence policies.

The Social Democrats believe Ireland should maintain our current form of neutrality, which can be described as politically aligned, but nonmembership of military alliances or mutual defence arrangements.

Seek to leverage at an EU-level Ireland’s history of non-colonialism, our international reputation in peace keeping, and military neutrality, in exhorting the primacy of diplomacy to prevent conflict.

Seek the recognition of a Palestinian state at EU level, and promote efforts to achieve a two-state solution on the basis of 1967 borders. We believe the two-state solution offers the only prospect of an enduring peace between Israel and the Palestinian people.

This will also involve the creation of a shared capital for the two states in Jerusalem, and the ending of the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands.

Seek to overcome EU-level impediments to the enactment of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 and the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill 2023.

Advocate for the suspension of the EU trade deal with Israel until the Israeli government complies with international law.

Support the supply of aid and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and sustain efforts at EU-level to ensure accountability for war crimes committed against the people of Ukraine.

Support the principles of the United Nations Charter to help find a diplomatic solution and enable a lasting peace for Eastern Europe.

Challenge the use of the EU’s international cooperation budget as an instrument to advance geopolitical and primarily foreign policy objectives, instead ensuring that aid is distributed on a principled basis; those principles must include fairness, justice, human rights, and sustainability.

Housing

The Social Democrats believe that housing is a fundamental right, needed to ensure people can live dignified lives without financial hardship, precarity or stress. We want to transform housing in Ireland by delivering high quality homes at an affordable cost. Several aspects of EU policy affect, or can affect, the delivery and regulation of housing at national level.

For example, the EU can have a role in regulating institutional investors, and the short-term letting sector.

Eurostat’s designation of the debt of Ireland’s Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector as being ‘on the public books’ acts as a headwind to public investment in housing. Recently proposed reforms of the EU Fiscal Rules seem unlikely to improve matters. Expediting the removal of AHBs from calculations of public debt will be a priority for our MEPs.

As well as this, many EU schemes could be used to develop new social housing in Ireland, or to increase the quality of the existing housing stock. There are literally tens of billions of euros available for the construction or renovation of homes in Ireland. However, few of these potentially lucrative funding streams are being utilised.

The Fiscal Rules

The EU Fiscal Rules require member states to keep their national debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 per cent, and ensure that annual budget deficits do not exceed 3 per cent of GDP. If these obligations are not respected, corrective measures must be taken. While there are recent examples of flexibility, these rules still have the potential to have a chilling effect on necessary public investment.

Ireland has a system of social and affordable housing provision that is strongly linked to the State, particularly around funding and oversight. Eurostat – the EU’s statistical agency – has judged that debts incurred by these housing providers should be considered part of the national debt.

While it is clear that Irish local authorities (city and county councils) and the Department of Housing are indeed arms of the state, this ruling also currently extends to AHBs which are not public bodies. Therefore, when the government

provides loan financing to an AHB to develop social housing, it is adding to its own debt and potentially (depending on debt and deficit levels) necessitating spending cuts or debt reduction measures elsewhere. The equivalents of AHBs in countries like Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands are not considered part of the public debt and so do not face the same funding constraints as in Ireland.

By the Commission’s own estimates, the funding gap for renovation of homes in the EU to meet climate targets is at least €115 billion per year. Given such a gap for lower income households who cannot self-finance renovations, there is a clear need for state intervention that the Fiscal Rules make exceedingly difficult.

Regardless of how AHBs are accounted for, the Fiscal Rules are not well aligned with investment to achieve vital public policy goals, including the provision of affordable housing. The European Commission has faced increased calls in recent years to adapt its economic governance, including the Fiscal Rules, to better allow member states invest in meeting essential policy objectives; most notably hitting their ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets. Our MEPs will continue to call for this in Brussels.

Ireland must find a route to remove AHBs from calculations of public debt to ensure the sector is better able to ramp up investment during the coming years.

Regulating Investment Funds

The European Union can have a role in investment fund regulation, regulating speculative flows of capital into housing and halting the negative financialisation of housing by real estate funds buying up homes.

Residential housing across the continent is becoming an increasingly attractive asset class for investors. This is thanks in part to national government policies which have ostensibly had the goal of assisting ordinary people, but have had the unintended consequence of essentially de-risking investment in housing by these funds. These consequences include pushing up house prices and restricting affordability to a decreasing field of potential homebuyers, and supporting rent-paying households and thereby ensuring stable returns for housing investors.

Recent European initiatives under the Capital Markets Union will likely see a further increase of residential housing under institutional ownership.

The Social Democrats want an end to favourable tax landscapes for institutional investors in the Irish property system, and a ban on the purchasing existing homes. We need a levy on investment funds to ensure they contribute to resolving a housing crisis that has earned them excessive profits for years. It is not acceptable for wealthy funds to be able to outbid ordinary homebuyers, whilst paying minimal tax on their extravagant income. Stopping the further financialisation of housing requires European-level coordination regulation.

Short-term Lets

The increased use of homes suitable for individuals and families to live in longterm as short-term tourist accommodation has caused problems in a number of areas in Ireland. Government has shown a reluctance to take strong action, given that the EU has a role in regulating the sector.

If in Government in Ireland, we want to require short-term rental platforms such AirBnB and Booking.Com to request that all entire properties in Rent Pressure Zones show proof of planning permission change; something for which we would legislate. We would insist these platforms take down all listings that don’t display a valid licence number - a licence number that would be issued to all permitted lets.

EU Funding Streams for Home Construction

There are a number of potentially lucrative EU funding streams which could be used to build homes in Ireland.

The InvestEU programme supports investment in areas such as sustainable infrastructure, social investment, and skills development, which can include the construction of social and affordable housing. The programme can provide a public guarantee fund for investments seen as risky (thereby providing access to finance on more favourable terms1 ), or can directly invest in projects where there is a funding gap. While InvestEU has potential to play an important role in providing cost-rental homes, to date it has not yet been used by social housing providers in Ireland.

Social housing providers looking to diversify their funding options could use InvestEU to ‘de-risk’, or to bridge potential funding gaps left by the private sector, allowing for financing that otherwise may not happen.

While the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) does not have a specific mandate related to housing, it can provide funding for projects that contribute to social inclusion and sustainable development, which may include investment in social housing. It has already supported initiatives to improve housing conditions, mainly renovating homes, and increasing energy-efficiency.

The European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) supports employment and social policies across the EU. Like the ERDF, the ESF+ does not have a specific policy or mandate related to social housing, but it can provide funding for projects that aim to improve social inclusion and access to affordable housing. A shortage of skilled labour in the construction sector has been identified as inhibiting renovation of the housing stock in Ireland. ESF+ funding can help address this issue and train the next generation of construction workers.

Horizon Europe (the EU's research and innovation funding programme for 20212027) can also support investment in social housing through projects aimed at improving housing conditions.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Seek to unlock all potential funding streams that could help increase supply and improve the affordability of housing in Ireland, and reform those streams to simplify access.

Work to change any EU rules that reduce the State’s ability to provide social and affordable housing.

Fight for reforms to EU State Aid rules to ensure essential public services like housing can be delivered by the State.

Call for increased flexibility in how investment in public housing is accounted for in the national debt and EU budgetary rules.

Seek to include housing exclusion indicators in the EU Semester (the biannual economic, fiscal, employment and social recommendations Member States).

Work for a regulation regime for investment funds in the property market that ensures they pay a fair level of tax, and their negative social influence is greatly reduced.

Work to reduce the impact of short-term rental platforms on availability and affordability of housing.

Support skills development with social service providers, local authorities and actors from the social and affordable housing sector.

Support a single market for housing finance, that would help reduce the cost of mortgages, and potentially of house building.

Agriculture

Farmers should be able to make a living from their crucial work while at the same time farming in a way that protects nature, enhances biodiversity, and minimises emissions. That they cannot do so represents a failure of policy, not of farmers.

No group stands to lose more from climate change and biodiversity loss than farmers. But many already do not receive a fair price for what they produce.

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) must support the necessary changes in how food is produced. It should promote an agricultural model that produces healthy food, provides stable and sustainable farm incomes, enhances food security, and improves environmental sustainability.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Work to make our food systems more resilient and support local production in line with the principles of food sovereignty and security.

Help to design a CAP focused not only on food production, but on creating sustainable farm incomes, reducing emissions and food waste, and improving soil quality.

Support a shift away from food production based on pesticides, monocultures, and animal suffering, and towards larger investment into organic farming and other more sustainable practices.

The current system subsidises an industrial agricultural model that is overly dependent on fertilisers, animal feed and fossil fuels, including from outside the EU.

Campaign to reduce the use of chemical pesticides to protect human health, improve soil quality, and enhance biodiversity.

This includes a ban on glyphosate.

Oppose unfair competition to European farmers from products that do not respect the same standards that they adhere to, including from countries outside the EU.

Address the negative impact our agricultural system has on developing countries.

Ensure that agricultural policymaking at EU level has a stronger focus on animal welfare.

Fisheries

Europe’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) must encourage a transition towards low-impact fisheries, with a transparent and fair system of quota distribution, and a sustainable seafood consumption. This transition must be planned in close cooperation with fishers and coastal communities. Europe needs to end overfishing and phase out harmful fishing practices.

Article 17 has been one of the most neglected elements of the CFP. It requires EU member states to allocate fishing opportunities using transparent and objective criteria with a focus on social, environmental, and economic criteria. This includes, for example, the use of fishing gears with low environmental impact and reduced energy consumption.

Article 17 offers the opportunity to incentivise sustainability by providing for priority access to fishing opportunities for environmentally low-impact fishing, while delivering social and economic benefits.

It can be used to ensure a just transition to a low carbon, low environmental impact, and socially just fishing fleet across the EU and in Ireland, something which is of critical and urgent importance if we are to meet our climate and biodiversity obligations set at national, European and global level.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Work to make our food systems, including fisheries and seafood imports, more secure and resilient, including by supporting local production.

Work with all fleet segments to develop and publish transparent and objective criteria of an environmental, social and economic nature and to deliver a fair transition to low-impact, low-carbon fishing.

Support low-impact approaches to fishing, and coastal communities.

Ensure that the Common Fisheries Policy is used to support the inshore sector on a proportionate basis.

Call for strong regulation of aquaculture (such as offshore fish farms) and aquaculture imports. The EU imports approximately 70 per cent of seafood consumed.

Work to effectively protect Marine Protected Areas, including from harmful fishing practices.

Regulating Artificial Intelligence

Law and politics are playing catch up with artificial intelligence (AI) and its consequences. There are major areas of concern related to the development of AI, including:

• Civil Liberties Infringements

• Labour Displacement

• Bias and Discrimination

• Barriers to Justice

• Misinformation

• Intellectual Property

• Climate, and even

• Existential Risk.

Big tech firms are the only global actors with the data, staff, and computing capabilities to drive progress in this area. This creates an unhealthy dynamic between member states and multinational corporations where much of the development of the technology that affects our lives is being done elsewhere. There is a critical need for global regulators to join forces in harnessing the societal impacts of AI, and potential for the EU to be a global legislative leader.

Meanwhile, the potentially positive impacts of AI are being lost in the discussion:

• Improved Efficiency and Effectiveness in Industry

• Technological Advancements for the Consumer

• Fairer Distribution of Labour across the Population, and

• Improvements in work/life Balance.

Social Democrat MEPs will provide the balanced leadership that is required to ensure we don’t stifle European innovation while also expanding the scope of influence on AI regulation beyond just industry, to include citizen’s concerns.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Build on the 2023 Artificial Intelligence Act for stronger regulation of the development of AI in Europe, with particular attention to the relationship between large technology companies and member states.

Monitor the use of AI by member state governments, particularly in the areas of surveillance, facial recognition, censorship, and civil liberties.

Impose sanctions where member states are wrongfully deploying AI to infringe on civil liberties.

Investigate the potential labour displacement that the development of AI will bring about, and explore frameworks and mechanisms to deal with it, including EU-wide labour creation and redistribution, basic income, shorter-working weeks, and retraining.

Develop law and policy that addresses the risk areas of artificial intelligence in relation to bias and discrimination, including with meaningful consultation with minority and marginalised groups.

Develop law and policy that addresses the risk areas of artificial intelligence in relation to intellectual property, copyright, and the climate crisis.

Investigate the broader existential risk posed by the development of AI that can ultimately threaten us as a species, and develop law and policy to mitigate.

Ensure that the progress of automation and AI doesn’t remove or distort access to, or affect administration of, justice.

Develop and implement EU-wide citizen information and awareness programmes to bridge the digital divide, increase digital literacy, and mitigate the rise of misinformation.

Increase cybersecurity efforts to prevent AI-based hacking attacks, with a special emphasis on protecting critical infrastructure.

Update and enforce legislation to promote the safe use of digital technologies by children, address the digital divide, and promote digital skills.

Ensure the design and use of AI systems is transparent.

Collaborate with US, Asian and global leaders to ensure a unified response to the development of AI in regulatory terms, and position Europe as the legislative leader in this area.

Safeguarding Democracy

In the face of mounting challenges to democracy, the Social Democrats will stand firm in our commitment to defend democratic values and principles.

Recent years have seen a rise in threats such as disinformation, far-right extremism, and political corruption, posing significant risks to the integrity of democratic institutions across Europe. In Ireland, the rise of the far-right has been seen in violent attacks to public property and marginalised groups – a stark reminder that the rise in extremism can take hold anywhere.

Now is the time to come together to protect the democratic institutions and fundamental rights that are at the heart of social democracy.

Safeguarding Democracy

Democracy is the cornerstone of our societies, and its preservation is nonnegotiable. Our MEPs will work to uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of all Irish citizens at European level.

By fostering an inclusive and pluralistic political environment, we will ensure that democracy remains resilient in the face of emerging challenges.

Strengthening Democratic Institutions

Social Democrats MEPs will work to protect the most important elements of democracy for Irish citizens in the European Union, including the rule of law. Recent demonstrations motivated by far-right extremist rhetoric in Ireland show that every member state is susceptible to the rise of the far-right.

We must act to halt the growth of extremist rhetoric, and ensure freedom and democracy are protected for European citizens.

Promoting Civic Engagement

Citizen participation is essential for the vitality of democracy. Building on successful models like the Conference on the Future of Europe, we will actively seek to engage citizens in the policymaking process.

As well as implementing the key actions from the Conference in the next legislative mandate, mechanisms such as the European Citizen’s Initiative should be promoted as opportunities for citizens to have a direct input into policymaking.

The Social Democrats will work to ensure that democratic mechanisms, including Citizens’ Assemblies, are expanded further to empower individuals to contribute to shaping EU policies that directly impact their lives

Combatting Disinformation and Ensuring Media Transparency

Disinformation poses a grave threat to the integrity of democratic elections and public discourse.

In the next European Parliament, the Political Transparency Regulation must be fully implemented to help safeguard the democratic process from manipulation and foreign interference.

Our MEPs will work to enhance media transparency, ensuring that European citizens have access to accurate information about the sources and funding behind political content online.

Tackling Corruption and Enhancing Accountability

The Social Democrats are committed to ending ‘golden circle’ politics and improving accountability in political life.

We are committed to rooting out corruption at all levels of government and governance, and will establish robust mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in political decision-making.

Instances like ‘Qatargate’ emphasise that corruption continues to influence how decisions are made at EU level. Whilst the hard work to ensure an independent ethics body was created in the previous mandate was successful, the body must be implemented to the highest possible standard to restore faith in the democratic legitimacy of the EU.

Economic Policy

Policy set in Brussels has important consequences for the Irish economy, and the effectiveness of economic decisions taken by the Irish government. The Social Democrats believe that increased flexibility is required to ensure that the EU’s fiscal rules and other economic levers do not inhibit important and necessary state investment or contribute to low economic growth.

For example, while the goal of the Stability and Growth Pact is to maintain fiscal stability within the Union, the Pact’s suspension to allow for the economic repercussions of Covid-19 was tacit acceptance of its limitations and was evidence of the need for increased flexibility on a more permanent basis.

Given that members of the Eurozone no longer control their own monetary policy, fiscal policy is government’s only significant policy lever with which to react to economic or social shocks. Any mechanisms that limit governments' ability to spend during an economic slump risk intensifying recessions and hampering growth.

It is not only economic shocks that require fiscal flexibility and the ability to react according to circumstances. Ireland has been facing, for a number of years, a raft of crises in different policy areas – most notably in health and housing. We have also committed to taking extraordinary and unprecedented action to reshape our economy and society to meet our international climate-related obligations.

Yet in spite of the obvious need for significant government intervention in these areas, Ireland, and other countries as well, continues to be constrained in its ability to borrow to finance even the most productive and socially necessary investments. Our MEPs will fight to change this.

We also believe that the mandate of the European Central Bank is in need of revision. A focus solely on price stability is too narrow. There are other economic concerns that must also be taken into account, particularly achieving full employment.

Social Europe is under threat from economic policies that seek to erode good pay and conditions for workers and prioritise the interests of large corporations over citizens. The resulting economic inequality has been exploited by nationalists and populists on the right who have stoked public anger and fear.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Advocate for revision of the Fiscal Rules to ensure States are not prevented from taking necessary action against high unemployment, climate change, and economic, social or environmental crises.

Campaign for a revised mandate for the European Central Bank, to include full employment alongside price stability.

Fight for reforms to EU State Aid rules to ensure essential public services, such as housing, can be delivered by the State.

We will also seek increased flexibility in how investment in public housing is accounted for in the national debt and EU budgetary rules.

Put the rights of European citizens before the economic freedoms of corporations.

Oppose the agenda of privatisation of public services that leads to wealth extraction and benefits only small groups of elites.

Work to reform the European financial system so that it enables rather than inhibits the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

This will involve reform the European Semester, and Multiannual Financial Framework.

Examine the possibility of an EU-wide wealth tax to combat inequality and fund a green transformation.

Advocate for a Europe-wide financial transactions tax to generate revenue whilst simultaneously curbing financial speculation.

Examine the possibility of making the European windfall tax on energy companies permanent to prevent profiteering in future energy crises.

Build on the appointment of an EU SME Envoy to set out a substantive EU SME Strategy, enshrining the SME ‘Think Small First’ Test across the European Commission and other institutions.

Advocate for revision of Green Financing legislation to ensure it aligns with EU Climate targets across all sectors and work to remove the bottlenecks and contradictions within different regulations and directives.

Monitor the development of EU trade agreements to ensure they include binding standards around the environment, human rights, workers’ rights, and consumer protection.

Oppose special commercial courts and private arbitration to deal with trade disputes, as part of trade agreements.

Support measures across European member states to mandate closure of the kinds of tax loopholes that syphon revenue from developing countries.

Actively engage with the next iteration of the European Expert Group on Social Economy and the delivery of the EU’s Social Economy Action Plan to help build an economy that is better for people and the planet.

Shine a light on the activities of lobbyists in Brussels who work to water down and/or block important and necessary environmental and social reforms.

Tackling Poverty

Everyone has the right to have their basic needs met through a combination of income and public service provision. As social democrats we believe in a strong social safety net that protects people at times of difficulty and those unable to provide for themselves.

In 2022, 95.3 million people in the EU were noted by Eurostat to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion, equivalent to 21.6 per cent of the population. According to UNICEF, one in four children – 20 million children – in the EU are at risk of poverty or social exclusion; an increase of almost one million since 2019.

The Europe 2020 target, set in 2010, of taking 20 million people out of poverty or social exclusion was missed by a very wide margin. Groups facing a higher risk of poverty and social exclusion include single households, migrants, and people with lower education, as well as their children.

Our MEPs will work towards the creation of a Social Europe that prioritises equality, poverty reduction, decent employment, supports for disabled people, and security in old age.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Demand an integrated anti-poverty strategy for the EU that will end homelessness by 2030, halve child poverty by 2030, and eliminate child poverty by 2040.

Ensure that EU economic policy has a focus on eliminating poverty and social exclusion.

Safeguard and accelerate recent progress on children’s rights and increase investment in important services for children.

Demand adequate funding for the European Child Guarantee so that all children have appropriate access to healthcare, nutrition, education, care, and accommodation.

Recognise the importance of trade unions and collective bargaining in overcoming low wages and in-work

poverty, helping to reduce income inequality, and improve wellbeing, health and other social outcomes.

Address inappropriate EU governance structures (particularly fiscal ones) that prohibit or inhibit important public investment by national governments.

Work to make the European Pillar of Social Rights enforceable through legislative initiatives, aiming for equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions, and social protection and inclusion.

Support additional funding for National Statistical Organisations so that data gaps can be filled and marginalised groups such as older people, women and girls, disabled people, Traveller and Roma people, and migrants and asylum seekers can be reached.

Other European Policies

Below are a number of other EU-level policy priorities we hold as a party across areas including violence against women, disability rights, education, and enhanced democratisation.

In Brussels, our MEPS will:

Exercise pressure to deliver a rigorous Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive on business and human rights, and support the Global Treaty for Business and Human Rights.

Very large corporations wield considerable influence and frequently manage to avoid genuine accountability for significant human rights violations. Companies should have a responsibility to respect human rights, workers’ rights, and environmental standards wherever they operate.

Support a zero-tolerance approach to violence against women by pushing for the development of a comprehensive EU legislative framework that addresses all forms of violence against women and girls.

Where appropriate, support the transfer of powers to local, regional and national government in line with the principles subsidiarity and that decisions affecting people should be made as close as possible to them.

Push for the expansion of FP10 – the next EU Research Fund (2027+) – and for it to be ring-fenced, with a particular focus on underpinning the Pillar 1 programme that funds discovery research.

Support increased funding for the Erasmus programme.

Work with the disability movement to ensure the fulfilment of the EU’s Strategy on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and work with any reestablished Disability Intergroup of the European Parliament on issues related to disability and the UN CRPD.

Work for a fairer energy pricing system, improving on the current system where linking electricity prices to the cost of gas (the marginal producer) means that prices don’t fall proportionately when renewable energy generation increases.

We need a comprehensive European strategy that will ensure consistent availability of sustainable energy at stable and affordable prices.

The biggest divide in Irish politics today is between those who want to exploit problems and those who are determined to tackle them. This is true at every level.

Over the next five years our local authorities can play a vital role in some of the most important issues facing our country – and especially in helping build more homes and securing safe and active communities. But to do this we need councillors who are committed to working constructively every day of their mandate.

In this election Fianna Fáil is proposing an ambitious, practical and positive programme of action for implementation in every local authority.

This action includes playing a part in helping to go much further in building on the major increase in home building we have delivered. This includes action on local dereliction and support for the full range of housing needs including affordable home ownership, social housing and secure, affordable rental homes.

Our proposals for action also include a range of specific measures which will help to:

• Ensure local representatives take a more active role in tackling crime and supporting safer communities.

• Implement a range of schemes to improve the physical condition of our villages, towns and city communities.

• Promote actions to ensure a vibrant and affordable childcare sector.

• Support for local small businesses as a core social and economic resource.

Having strong and vocal local councillors does matter as they can improve access to local services and enhance standards of living. They help families secure a home, work on the local development plan, ensure roads are invested in, and set the agenda for the future prosperity of their areas. Their decisions play a significant part in sustaining local economic success, promoting local culture and protecting the environment for the benefit of all.

On Friday 7th June Fianna Fáil is putting forward candidates in every electoral area in the country. They represent a broad range of backgrounds and experience. What unites them is their commitment to a positive agenda of working for local communities and delivering action on important issues throughout their mandate.

Delivering for Ireland, Delivering for You.

Create liveable communities

Fianna Fáil has got Ireland back building. Since entering government in 2020 we have turned the tide on housing with the largest numbers of homes being built and bought in a generation under our Housing for All plan. Fianna Fáil has been the driving force behind that transformation, and we will continue to support home building and first-time buyers. We are fully committed to building far more homes over the next five years.

We know that times are still hard for those struggling to buy a home or pay rent. Far too many people are homeless. We will always prioritise Housing. Our focus is on providing safe and secure homes to rent or buy, for all our people. More homes and more home owners, that’s our core policy. We will continue this in local government because Fianna Fáil is the party that builds homes.

Support home ownership We recognise the dignity and security that flows from holding the key to your own front door and the benefits of well-planned communities. We have doubled home building and will build 250,000 new homes over the next five years, with the aim to support a further 150,000 first-time buyers over the next five years.

In continuing to support home ownership, we will:

• Protect and extend the Help to Buy scheme, the First Home ‘Bridge the Gap’ Scheme, and the Vacancy Refurbishment Grants.

• Continue to roll out the biggest affordable housing scheme ever done with increased targets and supports for every local authority.

• Re-zone more land to meet a new ambitious target of 250,000 homes by 2030.

• Support all appropriate housing projects and proposals.

• Commit to not oppose social and affordable housing projects.

• Implement the new historic Planning and Development Bill to de-risk and accelerate home building.

• Maintain the development levy exemptions and water charge rebate to reduce constructions costs until December 2024 and review annually.

• Roll out Land Value Sharing and vacancy taxes.

• Encourage independent living by employing Disability Friendly Housing Technical Advisers in each local authority.

Deliver a new deal for renters and landlords Everyone should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. We will increase the supply of affordable accommodation for those seeking to rent while also enhancing tenant certainty and security. A healthy rental market needs affordable prices for renters and a fair return for landlords.

To deliver a new deal for renters and landlords, we will:

• Extend the rent tax credit.

• Reform Rent Pressure Zones.

• Introduce new powers to tackle anti-social behaviour in rogue tenancies through a text messaging-based system to allow residents to report to new dedicated Resident Support Units.

• Strengthen the powers of the local authority to evict tenants for extreme anti-social behaviour

• Set better standards for the upkeep of properties.

Reduce homelessness and protect vulnerable households Our dedication to increasing housing availability and supply remains steadfast. Today, more people are becoming homeowners than in a generation, but we must also ensure that homelessness is mitigated and that we continue to protect vulnerable households.

To reduce homelessness and protect vulnerable households, we will:

• Continue to build the largest social housing programme in the history of the state.

• Increase staff in local authorities to help reach our ambitious targets.

• Expand modern methods of construction to drive down construction costs and time.

• Expand the Tenant in Situ scheme and mainstream it throughout all local authorities.

• Rollout the Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme for independent living across all local authorities.

• Continue to fund the Land Development Agency to work with each local authority to build homes on state owned land.

Tackle vacancy and dereliction The total available housing stock has been eroded by the large number of vacant homes across the country. Fianna Fáil is determined to address this to allow communities to continue to thrive.

To tackle vacancy and dereliction, we will:

• Extend and expand the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant.

• Ensure every local authority has an expanded vacant property team.

• Introduce a special Local Authority Mortgage for Vacant Properties.

• Streamline compulsory purchase orders (CPO) powers for local authorities.

• Set CPO targets for each local authority.

• Implement new Part B Fire regulations that facilitate ‘over the shop’ living.

Planning and housing in the Gaeltacht Rural Ireland cannot be left behind in the future of home building. Local people have the right to own a home in their community and raise their family there, especially in the Gaeltacht. Historically, the Gaeltacht was made up of densely populated communities based on townlands and neighbourhood living. We want to ensure that this becomes a reality once again.

To ensure more planning and housing in the Gaeltacht, we will:

• Develop a Gaeltacht housing policy in every local authority with a Gaeltacht under their remit.

• Provide for Gaeltacht Language Planning designated areas in County Development Plans.

• Provide a ‘polasaí neartú Gaeltachta’ in all Gaeltacht plans to attract to and retain Irish speaking families.

Build safer communities

Too many homes and communities live in the shadow of intimidation. Anti-social behaviour by a minority damages the entire community. Building strong links between An Garda Síochána and the community in every part of the country is vital to building a safe society. Fianna Fáil in local government will ensure active links and communication between Councillors, Gardaí and local communities, helping to target Garda resources more effectively and fully respond to the individual needs of each area.

Tackle crime Tackling and mitigating crime and the threat of menace is the at the forefront of the work of Fianna Fáil’s Councillors. On the ground policing is the most effective way of preventing crime. Building strong, enduring connections with local areas is an integral part of the strength of An Garda Síochána and is vital to building safer communities.

The scourge of drug abuse is a problem throughout the country and this needs to be constantly tackled on many levels. Local Drug Taskforces need to be adequately resourced in order to rise to the growing challenge. Fianna Fáil will ensure these bodies are equipped to address serious drug issues in their areas with an increased Garda role.

To tackle crime in our communities, we will:

• Foster effective partnerships between Gardaí, local authorities and communities to create safer environments.

• Prioritise public safety in towns and cities by boosting funding for Crime Prevention Officers to support neighbourhood watch groups.

• Set up Community Policing Teams, incorporating community Gardaí so that they are known and available to neighbourhoods.

• Implement nationwide rollout of the confidential ‘See Something, Say Something’ text alert service.

• Increase funding for CCTV surveillance.

• Allocate resources for Local Community Safety Partnerships, with clear roles for Councillors.

• Ensure that Community Safety Partnerships sit in a plenary on a half-yearly basis, with questioning from Councillors and TDs.

• Introduce a dedicated police force for public transport.

• Expand existing and create new Local Drug Taskforces where they are not yet available, ensuring sufficient resourcing and collaboration with An Garda Síochána.

Enhance the public realm The public realm broadly refers to those areas of a town or city which the public has access to including streets, footpaths, parks, squares, bridges and public buildings and facilities. These spaces give a town its character and also determine how residents and visitors circulate, travel and interact within the town’s environs.

We have seen the positive impact that investment and innovative thinking can have on our public realm during and since the pandemic, with many communities embracing the outdoors. This must continue. Fianna Fáil in local government will continue to ensure that towns and villages are the focus of local life and receive the supports they need to meet their full potential.

To improve the look and feel of communities, we will:

• Fund a ‘Brighter Streets’ campaign to improve public lighting in each local authority, ensuring communities are safe and welcoming environments for all who live and visit them.

• Provide for a new round of URDF projects to continue to transform the public realm and address dereliction.

• Expand the Town Centre First Policy nationwide to revive declining towns.

• Declutter public spaces for universal usability by removing unnecessary obstacles.

• Widen footpaths for pedestrians, wheelchair users and parents with prams/buggies.

• Continue to beautify towns and villages by promoting biodiversity, planting more trees, flowers, and shrubs, and maintaining existing ones.

• Expand the creation of Tobacco-Free Spaces in community settings, including vaping.

Foster responsible communities

Farmers and fishers require continued support and practical agricultural and environmental policies to sustain these standards and ensure food security for Ireland. Fianna Fáil is committed to upholding these standards and continuing to work hard for our rural farming and fishing communities. Farmers and fishers deserve acknowledgement for their positive environmental, biodiversity, and societal contributions and we will continue to work with them.

Notwithstanding this, climate change is the foremost challenge for our generation and those to come. We are equally committed to putting sustainability and respect for our natural environment and built heritage at the core of all local government policy, while also enabling a just transformation to a carbon neutral society and economy ensuring that nobody is left behind. The actions we take now to address this will define our legacy for future generations.

We have led nationally on these issues and will continue to do so at the local level. We will continue to lead with decisive, committed and innovative policies to support our rural communities and simultaneously reduce our carbon dependence. Local authorities through their climate action plans have an important part to play.

Protect agriculture, the marine and rural development We support and value farms and farm production. Farmers and fishers are custodians of the rural and coastline environment, and we will continue to support them in their role to make these industries more sustainable. This stems from our deep understanding of the urgency of food security and promoting viable agriculture.

We want to see farmers confident in what they do, proud in what they deliver and assured about the future of their industry. We will continue our work to ensure that Irish farming has a strong future at the forefront of the Irish economy and that Fianna Fáil continues as the farmers party in local government.

To protect agriculture and the marine and encourage rural development, in local government we will:

• Maintain and protect funding under the CAP.

• Establish Agricultural Committees in local authorities to shape agricultural policies, involve stakeholders from farmers to food producers and rural agri-business, and encourage generational renewal.

• Ensure that farmers voices are included as community groups and represented in their own right as part of the Public Participation Network.

• Encourage the promotion of agriculture and rural Ireland through land management and short supply chains in future agricultural policies, especially at the local level.

• Enact local bylaws to align local farm inspections with national pauses during adverse weather events.

• Invest in green energy and enterprise training in rural and regional areas to diversify income across the sector.

• Ensure that the funding allocated to local authorities to maintain rivers and streams is fully spent each year.

• Create an Ash Removal Fund for local authorities to work with landowners to remove dangerous trees on roadside land.

• Collaborate with farmers and industry to further improve water quality.

• Establish a Just Transformation Committee within each local authority.

• Support fishing communities with pier and harbour development and fleet modernisation.

• Prioritise the development of coastal infrastructure such as piers, harbours, roads, social services and community buildings, schools and healthcare facilities to enable communities living on the Islands to be sustainable and to continue to grow.

• Unlock the potential of local authority run ports as tourism and economic assets within communities.

• Support the work at EU level to increase our fish quotas to sustain coastal communities for generations to come.

• Establish a Coastal Erosion Fund in local authorities that have areas affected by this.

Improve animal welfare Pets provide great comfort and companionship to people of all ages and abilities in our communities and we must ensure that our public spaces are welcoming for them and their owners. Nonetheless, this must be balanced with responsible ownership and welfare. The local authority has an important role to play in this, ensuring that there are adequate

spaces for pets to roam, while also keeping our streets, parks and beaches clean through enforcement of local bylaws and restrictions.

In encouraging positive pet behaviour and improving animal welfare, we will:

• Provide more dog and pet parks.

• Strengthen enforcement of animal control laws to prevent endangerment to people, animals, and property.

• Promote campaigns for more responsible ownership and improved welfare.

• Increase the number and remit of Animal Welfare Officers to tackle offences such as illegal unregulated sulky racing along our roadways with An Garda Síochána.

• Increase compliance checks for microchipping of horses.

Clean, green communities We have a huge opportunity to make Ireland a renewable energy hub thanks to our geographic location on the west coast of Europe. We need to tap into this without further delay. Fianna Fáil will maximise this potential to generate regional jobs and prosperity while also driving our emissions down to zero.

The skies and seas offer our twenty-first-century natural resources. We will continue to advocate for harnessing renewable energy to rejuvenate coastal and rural communities. In conjunction with this, we will continue to reduce emissions in our inland communities, ensuring that we bring people along with us on this just transformation journey and to safeguard our health and wellbeing well into the future.

To create clean, green communities, we will:

• Implement the new Planning and Development Bill to make Ireland a major provider of offshore wind energy for Europe.

• Support ports in enhancing infrastructure to meet offshore renewable energy goals, support the economy, and strengthen trading relationships.

• Ensure equitable investment and job opportunities for rural, coastal, and island communities in wind power and renewable energy development.

• Create Local Renewable Energy Trusts to directly benefit communities from clean energy projects.

• Launch a ‘Trees in Towns’ campaign to increase urban tree coverage.

• Establish Circular Economy Taskforces in each local authority to collaborate with businesses, schools, and community groups.

• Reduce energy usage in local authority buildings through measures like rainwater collection, electricity reduction and food waste reduction initiatives in canteens.

• Identify gaps and establish one-stop shops for retrofitting in local authorities where none exists.

• Continue and expand the retrofitting of local authority homes.

• Support the Public Transport Accessibility Retrofit Programme for older fleets and facilities.

Improve water, sewerage and services Ireland has a beautiful countryside and urban landscape that we have a duty to maintain and protect. Keeping clean streets and a pristine countryside is an important duty of local authorities. Ramped up fines, litter wardens and a new fund to support innovative ways to reduce littering will be crucial to ensuring we protect our communities from being spoiled.

To improve services provided by local authorities, we will:

• Refocus local authority priorities on core services such as road maintenance, footpaths, drainage, tree pruning and planting, and public lighting.

• Create a ‘Clean Streets, Safe Streets’ fund to enhance street cleaning, increase bins and combat litter.

• Expand wastewater treatment to areas lacking functional systems, ensuring compliance with EU environmental standards.

• Upgrade sewerage systems in towns with populations of less than 5,000.

Encourage inclusive communities

The importance of fostering a sense of community derives from the pride Irish people have in their culture and heritage. Preserving the integrity of place names, employing Irish language Officers, and exploring innovative avenues for the use and appreciation of the language are crucial responsibilities that local authorities must uphold. Our national language deserves to be cherished and promoted with vigour, ensuring its enduring vitality and significance in our society.

Advance accessibility and inclusion A key goal for Fianna Fáil locally is to ensure that people with a disability are empowered to take their place at the heart of the community. From implementing a comprehensive change to physical infrastructure to changes of societal norms, it is vital that independent living is placed at the heart of overall policy. People with a disability will also be equipped to play a greater role in local decision-making drawing on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability (UNCRPD). This, along with actions to ensure that people with dementia, autism and other neurological conditions, will form the basis for our accessibility and inclusion work in local authorities.

To advance accessibility and inclusion in our communities, we will:

• Establish Local Government Disability Forums and Inclusion Strategies.

• Establish Implementation Committees on the UNCRPD in each local authority.

• Introduce a local authority Disability Awareness Card.

• Require all public-facing local authority staff to undergo disability, equality, and dementia training.

• Ensure all district engineers are trained in universal design accessibility in public works projects such as accessible buildings, paths, walkways, restoration and refurbishment projects.

• Mandate that funding from the local authority will only be granted for public works if those works have been fully disability proofed.

• Expand the Autism Friendly and Dementia Friendly towns and cities initiatives nationwide.

• Promote the role of Dementia Advisers in the community.

• Increase neurodiverse-friendly communities across the country.

• Implement inclusive community engagement initiatives for people living with dementia and their families such as reminiscence walking trails, business friendly environments, and increased signage at healthcare services in towns and villages.

• Enforce stricter penalties for unauthorised parking in disability parking bays.

• Rollout a map of all state-owned disability parking spaces and enable private operators to report places in private ownership.

• Appoint and support Disability Access Officers in every local authority as per the Disability Act 2005.

• Prioritise accessibility (including accessible buses, waiting areas and embarking/ disembarking platforms) in the rollout of all Local Link and public transport routes.

• Install ‘Changing Places Toilet Facilities’ in public buildings, where possible, making these spaces fully accessible.

• Enhance public rest areas and create sensory-friendly spaces, like breastfeeding rooms in libraries and seating along pathways and transport stops.

Cultivate community building The power of a strong sense of community cannot be overstated, and it is often that spirit of volunteerism that is the glue that keeps our communities together. This is something that we must continuously build on, ensuring that we have a resilient foundation for a successful society.

To cultivate community building, we will:

• Establish a Community Development Committee in each local authority where none exists.

• Support the Tidy Towns through increased frequency of general council services such as litter picking and street cleaning.

• Create a dedicated Community Centre Fund to support smaller projects, ideas and initiatives that come through, or inspire, voluntary social action.

• Sustain funding for voluntary groups providing essential community services.

Protect people’s rights Inclusive communities promote solidarity and understanding among people from diverse backgrounds. By bridging divides and fostering empathy, they build stronger social bonds and reduce discrimination and prejudice. Local authorities can act as important actors of change in this regard by celebrating different cultures, perspectives and identities. We will work to ensure that this prevails, leaving no space for hatred in our country.

In protecting the rights of all, we will:

• Establish a Community Integration Fund, guided by an equality framework, to encourage positive connections among communities and groups such as those from the LGBTQI+ and Traveller communities.

• Create Integration Forums within Public Participation Networks to facilitate idea exchanges and provide feedback to local authorities.

• Support the cultures and identities of others through funding for community engagement and celebrations.

Advance the arts and culture Ireland has a proud artistic and cultural heritage that we need to cherish and foster. However, for too many communities, the arts are a peripheral affair rather than a core part of a good life. We need to open our cultural life to all communities. Creating a space for groups to express themselves and for talented artists to thrive and flourish is an important responsibility of local government. We will foster this and the role that the arts and culture play in bringing communities and people together.

To promote the arts, treasuring our rich, diverse and evolving heritage, we will:

• Make Culture Night a quarterly event.

• Develop clear local action plans with the sector to promote culture, music, and arts.

• Prioritise arts organisations for civic and community use of available buildings for temporary and long-term opportunities.

• Incorporate art space in all regeneration projects and engage with the local arts sector throughout the process.

• Work with businesses to extend cultural venue hours, building on the success of initiatives such as the ‘Thursday Lates at the National Gallery’.

• Assist community groups with insurance costs for festivals and events.

• Expand the artist-in-residence programme for schools.

Support the Irish language Our national language is an invaluable cultural asset that must be actively cherished and promoted. Local authorities have an important role to play in maintaining the integrity of place names, utilising Irish Language Officers and putting forward new ways to use and enjoy the language, ensuring its enduring vitality and significance in our society. Fianna Fáil Councillors will continue to actively support Irish as a vibrant, living language of the people and an integral part of our daily life.

In continuing to support the Irish language, we will:

• Appoint a full-time Irish Language Officer and establish an Irish Language Committee in each local authority.

• Ensure new developments and community spaces receive appropriate local Irish names.

• Enhance community support for the Irish language through initiatives such as ciorcal comhrá in libraries nationwide and through increased community signage as Gaeilge.

Caithfear an teanga náisiúnta a chothú agus a chur chun tosaigh le fuinneamh chun deimhin a dhéanamh de go leanfaidh beocht agus stádas na Gaeilge inár sochaí.

Lifelong learning Our library network forms a vibrant base for learning and cultural enrichment across Ireland. We should draw on those strengths and ensure that libraries continue to play a central role in Irish life into the future with a few simple but effective measures.

To encourage a love of lifelong reading and engagement with library services, we will:

• Increase library funding to promote early library use and foster a lifelong love of reading and regular library use among primary-aged children.

• Boost funding for children and young adult collections in libraries.

• Extend library hours for multifunctional community including study hubs, working spaces, and community events for those returning to the workplace or newly retired.

• Expand outreach library services, particularly in rural areas and invest in mobile libraries.

• Increase remuneration for Irish-based authors through the Public Lending Remuneration scheme to support new and emerging writers.

• Improve Irish language services and materials in all libraries.

• Establish a new scholarship and mentorship programme for student writers.

• Introduce ‘take one leave one’ libraries at all train stations and bus stops.

Enhance public participation Directly elected mayors and re-established Town Councils will be at the core of a local government system that delivers for communities. This must be coupled with greater transparency and accountability. Fianna Fáil will achieve this. We also recognise the importance of wide participation in local democracy and cultivating an appreciation for local history and civic awareness and we plan to foster these objectives for all ages in the community.

To encourage greater civic awareness and public participation, we will:

• Encourage school participation in Comhairle na nÓg through outreach and open council meetings.

• Introduce a Mayoral/Cathaoirleach’s Local History Award to foster an interest in local history.

• Establish representative groups through Public Participation Networks to enhance diversity in local government.

• Mandate gender targets for board appointments in local authorities, such as the County Development Board and the Safeguarding Adult Board.

• Reform local authority public consultation methods for easier public feedback by providing online feedback forms, survey style response forms, and easy-to-read versions.

• Introduce a Directly Elected Mayor of Dublin.

• Reinstate Town Councils for towns with a population of 7,500 or more.

• Support legislation against protesting at private residences.

• Increase Councillors’ powers as the primary link between communities and central government, as opposed to the current structure that gives Town Teams more powers as unelected officials.

• Implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system in every local authority to ensure timely responses from directors of services to Councillors, enhancing transparency and accountability.

• Require Directors of Services to attend Municipal District meetings.

• Extend the review period for county and city plans to allow for a comprehensive democratic examination by Councillors.

Connect communities

The cohesive social fabric that binds communities together is intrinsically linked to the quality of their physical infrastructure. Fianna Fáil remains steadfast in its dedication to enhancing public services. Good connectivity between communities cultivates a sense of belonging and unity among residents, encouraging active participation in local initiatives.

This connection is reinforced by robust infrastructure, including roads, public transportation, and broadband, which are essential for economic prosperity. By facilitating access to larger markets, promoting tourism, and attracting investment, such infrastructure development contributes to the growth of communities nationwide — an endeavour Fianna Fáil pledges to continue over the next five years.

Support enterprise and economic development Fianna Fáil is committed delivering balanced regional development and the overall objective of this is to drive job creation and enterprise in each region throughout Ireland. Balanced regional development is critical to ensuring all parts of the country share in the benefits of growth. Fianna Fáil in local government will continue to achieve this.

Central to this success is the continued support for small and medium sized (SME) businesses. SMEs are vital to Ireland’s success and are central to our ability to build a broad-based economy and wider society. The vast majority of businesses in Ireland

are small (99%). This group of firms have faced a number of significant challenges in recent years as a result of a series of economic shocks resulting in cost increases. We will continue to help SMEs to focus on long-term financial sustainability, to increase productivity and to grow and thrive so as to sustain good jobs into the future at a local level.

In supporting enterprise and economic development, we will:

• Partner with Fáilte Ireland and other bodies to make places destinations of choice.

• Implement ambitious tourism plans in every local authority.

• Enhance international marketing of Ireland through increased town twinning.

• Support businesses in obtaining Protected Geographical Indication and Protected Designation of Origin status, as a tool for wider economic development.

• Provide serviced office space and hot desks in broadband-challenged areas to support remote work and community connections.

• Align local economic and community plans with EU policies to access funding such as URBACT and the European Regional Development Fund.

• Boost infrastructure and economic development by hosting major events such as the Ryder Cup.

• Enhance funding for rural infrastructure projects through the CLÁR programme.

• Establish Digital Development Offices to expand Broadband Officers’ roles, improving digital infrastructure and managing public information projects like weather updates and traffic incidents.

• Create a Coastal Community Development Fund to support regional ports and maritime communities, boosting tourism.

• Forge strong partnerships with the education sector via County and City Development Plans.

Advance active travel for community wellbeing The impact of active travel schemes is often more positive than people expect, with positive knock-on effects for local food and retail businesses and of course, traffic congestion and emissions reductions. We will continue to make active travel a viable, safe and attractive alternative transport mode with policies that incorporate health and equity into transport planning. We will ensure that local authorities take the lead in creating a safe environment for cycling and walking to build up liveable streets for all the community.

In supporting community wellbeing and active travel, we will:

• Support community integration and development by continuing to fund active travel initiatives like rural walks, blueways and greenways.

• Prioritise active travel projects promoting walking and cycling in all areas.

• Reopen the successful Safe Routes to School Programme to improve road safety and encourage active travel among school communities.

• Develop e-bike and e-scooter schemes in towns and cities.

• Provide secure bicycle storage in coordination with active travel infrastructure.

Revitalise transport offerings Many bus stops, train stations and streets have inadequate lighting and surfacing that discourages people from using them at night. Fianna Fáil will ensure streets and key public transport points are brightly lit and serviced to encourage the nighttime economy, active travel and safety in our communities.

To support the continued rollout of transport options and availability, we will:

• Extend the ‘kids go free’ initiative for public transport.

• Improve local transport links to essential infrastructure, including airports, ports, and main hubs.

• Increase electric vehicle charging points.

• Invest in public transport to meet climate goals.

• Continued unprecedented investment in walking and cycling infrastructure for commuting and tourism.

• Support the nighttime economy with extended public transport hours and secure bicycle parking and cycling routes.

• Integrate school and public transport services for enhanced community access, working with the Department of Education, Bus Éireann and local transport providers.

• Expand the Local Hackney Pilot Programme to improve rural transport options.

• Enhance safety at transport hubs with improved lighting, visibility, and incident reporting.

• Expand the Public Piano scheme to all major transport stations.

• Improve segregated cycle paths with safety-focused designs, avoiding hazardous obstacles.

Strengthen road safety A culture of recklessness has developed on Ireland’s roads, with significant cohorts of people ignoring the law and the need to slow down. Local authorities have an important role to play in combatting the increase in road fatalities and accidents and our Councillors take this responsibility very seriously. We will ensure that a thorough review of speed limits is conducted across the country, making a more consistent approach to these limits on local and rural roads.

To strengthen the road network and, most importantly, road safety, we will:

• Introduce a ‘Safer Town Vision Zero’ fund to address hazardous bends, junctions and roads, improving safety in towns, villages, and communities.

• Expand traffic calming measures alongside Councillors’ involvement in the Speed Limit Review.

• Enhance the Community Improvement Scheme (CIS) and Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) to improve connectivity to homes, farmland, and amenities, resolving existing backlogs.

• Review LIS criteria and maximise uptake.

• Collaborate with residents to manage all existing roads to homes, enhancing road surfaces nationwide.

• Implement a comprehensive road repair strategy with dedicated funding.

• Conduct surveys of roadside trees to remove those affected by ash dieback

• Progress key projects to address gaps in regional connectivity, to support regional development and to improve road safety.

Promote thriving active communities

Communities that prioritise active retirement, sports, inclusivity, and addressing loneliness play a multifaceted role in society. They promote healthy aging and social cohesion but also foster lifelong learning, diversity, and mental wellbeing. By challenging ageist stereotypes and providing inclusive environments, these communities empower individuals to lead fulfilling lives and remain integral parts of Irish society. We are steadfast in our commitment to create these communities, supporting people of all ages to thrive and continue to play a central role in Irish life into the future.

Tackle loneliness and social isolation Social isolation and loneliness are well known as causes of mental health problems and physical illness for people of all ages from all backgrounds. In local government, we can and will reshape how we tackle this issue.

To tackle loneliness and social isolation, we will:

• Support active retirement to combat loneliness and enhance community connectivity.

• Utilise school buildings after hours to minimise the demand for additional community facilities, including school halls, sports fields, and gymnasiums.

• Allow for libraries and public buildings to provide initiatives such as singing groups and reading projects for people who may be housebound or disconnected from local public services.

• Support the ‘triangle of supports’ of day care, home care and the meals on wheels services to foster positive ageing.

• Collaborate with schools and youth organisations to support young people to reduce smartphone and social media usage which is a growing public health concern.

• Improve signposting for mental health awareness and support services across communities.

• Encourage volunteering as a way to connect with others and make a positive impact in the community.

Increase access to sport Sports clubs and community groups are the lifeblood of communities across the country. The spirit of volunteerism that inspires so many people to spend time as coaches, fundraisers and a wide host of other roles is the glue that keeps our communities together. We will ensure that local authorities assist people to ensure clubs reach their full potential and positively impact as many people as possible. We will work hard with national and local sporting bodies to increase this, ensuring that barriers to access are removed.

To increase access to sports across the country we will:

• Establish a new URDF style fund for solely for acquiring new lands for parks and playing pitches for growing areas to build liveable communities.

• Increase accessibility to sports equipment in public areas.

• Develop more municipal all-weather community pitches in urban areas with limited development space.

• Enhance funding for municipal facilities and minority sports through the Sports Capital Funding.

• Create Sports Committees within all local authorities to manage funds from a dedicated Sports Development Fund.

• Collaborate with Swim Ireland to expand coverage of ‘Pop-Up Pools’ in each local authority.

• Increase the number of community playgrounds and Playground Communication Boards.

• Invest in community childcare infrastructure, including facilities and outdoor spaces, to foster safe and welcoming environments for children.

• Work with landowners to encourage rights of ways for walking and hiking groups.

• Maintain and improve hiking trails and hill walking routes.

• Improve water quality monitoring and communication, particularly during summer months, to ensure recreational swimming areas meet safety standards.

• Implement increased safety measures at sea and river swimming spots, including extended lifeguard services.

Encourage inclusivity Communities play a crucial role in making those living within them feel welcome and at home. We have witnessed this throughout the country, where communities have embraced and adapted positively to the challenges of increased migration. We will ensure that this welcome and inclusive spirit continues through better and increased communication and support for integration efforts locally.

To encourage greater inclusivity in our communities we will:

• Recognise the positive contribution that immigration has on providing good public services and being the backbone of many sectors across Ireland.

• Establish Local Integration Forums which will include all local stakeholders and civic society groups to help with integration and allow people to safely discuss and have their concerns about immigration addressed. These Forums will also act as a catalyst for ideas and feedback to the local authority directly from communities.

• Ensure that the Community Recognition Fund is utilised in full for integration purposes and work with all community groups to identify new projects and proposals that will build on these integration efforts.

• Work to ensure that accommodation for international protection applicants can continue to be used to provide essential services to communities such as hotel bars, restaurants, banquet facilities and meeting rooms.

• Work to decrease the number of hotels that are being utilised for temporary accommodation overall.

"Local 2024: Fine Gael","FOREWORD

Foreword by Taoiseach Simon Harris TD

On Friday 7 June, the people of Ireland will go to the polls in local and European elections. To you, the voter, I want to ask you for your trust, your support and your vote.

Fine Gael believes in the value of public representation. Across the country, our councillors are working to deliver for you, your family and your communities. While others seek to sow division in towns and villages across the country, we want to unite in the face of great challenges. This manifesto sets out our vision for the next five years at local level and the set of priorities that will guide us.

They are:

1. More homes, more home ownership

2. Backing small business and enterprise

3. A new partnership for rural Ireland and farmers

4. Enforcing law and order

5. Firm and fair migration

6. Better public services and infrastructure

7. Healthy and sustainable communities

Fine Gael councillors are at the centre of communities across the country. They need your support to deliver the step-change needed in housing at local authority level.

Fine Gael has overseen the largest investment in community development. However, we need to ensure your towns and villages are cleaner and more accessible.

Communities must have the services for you and your family, whether that be playgrounds, transport, childcare, or sports facilities.

A vote for Fine Gael is a vote for law and order and safer streets.

We have much to be positive about. More people are living in rural Ireland than ever before, more people are working in rural Ireland than ever before and more investment is going into rural Ireland than ever before. But we know we need to do more and balanced regional development will remain a priority for me as Taoiseach. Our urban areas also need investment, including better safety, better transport and better services.

Under my leadership, Fine Gael will work to deliver for you, for your community, for our country. We promise if you give your vote to Fine Gael, we will work, day and night, to help make things better. We will have your back. We will repay your trust. Together, we promise we will deliver. With a new energy. With new leadership.

Working with you.

Working for you.

Simon Harris TD Taoiseach

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fine Gael’s priorities for the next five years

1. More homes, more home ownership

Building more homes will be our number one priority both nationally and at local level. We are seeing really positive momentum on house building, with 350 homes commencing every working day so far in 2024. This construction activity is happening all over the country, but we need to see more of a regional spread in every county in Ireland.

Fine Gael will build 250,000 homes over the next five years. Our councillors will work with their local authority to develop a Housing Delivery Action Plan, with specific targets for social and affordable homes. Our councillors will hold the local authority to account for their building targets.

Fine Gael will retain the Help to Buy scheme and the First Home scheme, two crucial supports to help people purchase their own home.

We will continue to increase the rent tax credit to help people save for their deposit.

Fine Gael wants to help people build on their own land.

2. Backing Small Business and Enterprise

Fine Gael representatives and the Fine Gael Small Business & Enterprise Council have been travelling around the country, listening to businesses and the challenges that they face. When elected leader, Simon Harris TD promised to bring forward a package to address rising costs for small businesses and within weeks, he delivered.

Our team of Ministers Peter Burke, Heather Humphreys, Patrick O’Donovan, Paschal Donohoe, Emer Higgins and Neale Richmond worked together to develop a 15-point plan, which provides certainty and some much-needed

relief, based on feedback from businesses up and down this country.

This is just a start. Under Fine Gael, we will ensure every decision taken by Government is assessed for its impact on small and medium enterprises.

We will build allegiances between education and enterprise with a specific focus on the needs of each region. We will help fund the upskilling and reskilling of workers taking the cost off the employer.

We will reform commercial rates.

3. A new partnership for rural Ireland and farmers

We are investing more money in rural Ireland than ever before.

Fine Gael established the Department of Rural and Community Development and it is rolling out a range of grants, schemes and funds that are transforming our villages, towns and cities.

Fine Gael will develop practical supports to help the farming community.

Agriculture is a vital part of our economy and farmers’ work must be rewarded and valued.

We have held 15 meetings across the country with farmers – to listen to them and understand their concerns. Our agricultural group has now developed a series of proposals which we plan to implement over the medium term. We have listened on succession, on retirement and other worries facing the farming community.

Under Taoiseach Simon Harris’ leadership, we want to engage in a new partnership on agriculture where farmers are central to the changes we are making.

4. Enforcing law and order

Fine Gael will always stand for law and order. We are the party that founded An Garda Síochána. A vote for Fine Gael is a vote for a party that stands shoulder to shoulder with the men and women of An Garda Síochána and the families that support them. This party has taken several measures to support Gardaí on the beat and we will do more.

We are increasing penalties for knife crime. We are deploying body-worn cameras for Gardaí in Dublin City Centre, Waterford, and Limerick in 2024, with nationwide roll-out to follow.

Drug use is causing serious harm to communities and families across the country. Fine Gael is committed to addressing this. We will work with communities to tackle drug use. Working with An Garda Síochána and families, we will continue to ensure we inform people of the dangers of drug use and the consequences of purchasing drugs.

We will strengthen the use of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) to combat the challenges of anti-social behaviour.

5. Firm and fair migration

Ireland will maintain a migration system that is firm, fair and enforced and we will do so in accordance with international law and fundamental rights. We are very conscious that communities want to play their part but the system to date has not been good enough, placing unfair pressures on communities around the country.

Taoiseach Simon Harris is leading efforts to ensure all state agencies and communities are working productively together.

We will move away from the emergency use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. It is not acceptable that the only functioning hotel in a town can be taken away from a community overnight.

The Government is working to put in place facilities for those seeking protection on state land. We will not stand for any more unnecessary delays in making state land available for accommodation.

We cannot and should not lose sight of the benefits of migration. Our economy is built on being open: we need workers in all sectors like agriculture, in our health service and to build homes. We have to help those in need and we cannot achieve that without rules-based systems that dismantle the criminal trafficking gangs.

We acknowledge we have not got everything right, but some political parties speak out of both sides of their mouths when it comes to migration. One day, they want more migrants, the next they want an end to open borders. We won’t play politics on migration. We will focus on taking swift action in the best interests of all people in Ireland.

6.Better public services funded by a strong economy

Due to Fine Gael’s careful management of the public finances, we are now able to spend record levels on infrastructure and put money away for future generations. This year, €13 billion is being made available for investment to provide more schools, homes, roads and hospitals.

As we have learned, increased funding does not always lead to better services.

We will work at local and national level to improve the quality of services in a range of areas, from childcare, disability, to education and transport.

We need to maintain our road infrastructure and invest in public transport. Fine Gael will also strive to improve access to bike schemes across the country, including a new bike to college scheme.

Fine Gael is the party that delivered the Technological Universities to the regions. Fine Gael will be the party to invest in each TU to ensure each thrives.

Fine Gael believes all money collected locally through the Local Property Tax should be retained within the county. We also want to maintain councillors’ discretion to decide the Local Property Tax rate for their area. Taxpayers deserve to know where their money is being spent. Fine Gael will work at local and national level to detail where your money is being spent.

7. Healthy and Sustainable Communities

Local authorities have an important role to play in creating communities in which we want to live, work and raise a family.

With record levels of investment in Health, Fine Gael will encourage greater co-operation between the new Health Regions and local authorities in addressing the health needs of each region.

Councillors can input on the range and operation of local health services through Regional Health Forums. In this new approach, strong representative voices will become even more important, and Fine Gael will ensure that we have the team to advocate for better local health services.

Keeping our streets clean, tackling illegal dumping and improving access to bins will be a key commitment of Fine Gael councillors.

Fine Gael will fund improved public lighting, better access to dog parks, and ensure that new, innovative play and recreation spaces are provided in every county – both urban and rural.

We will increase funding to libraries and sports facilities in every county.

Our councillors are committed to engaging with and listening to people with disabilities and disability organisations so that we can work together to ensure our towns and cities work for everyone.

We will ensure our communities feel the benefits of our economic success through balanced regional development ensuring communities benefit from largeand small-scale renewable energy projects. We will work on new ways to unlock the potential of the circular economy and improve waste management.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Tosaíochtaí Fhine Gael le haghaidh na gcúig bliana le teacht - achoimre fheidhmeach

1. Tuilleadh tithe, úinéireacht tí níos mó

Beidh sé mar chéad tosaíocht dúinn tuilleadh tithe a thógáil ar leibhéal náisiúnta agus ar leibhéal áitiúil araon. Tá dul chun cinn thar a bheith dearfach le feiceáil againn faoi láthair maidir le tógáil tithe, agus cuireadh tús le hobair ar 350 teach gach lá oibre go dtí seo in 2024. Tá an ghníomhaíocht thógála sin ag tarlú ar fud fad na tíre, ach teastaíonn uainn leathadh réigiúnach níos mó a fheiceáil i ngach contae in Éirinn.

Tógfaidh Fine Gael 250,000 teach sna cúig bliana le teacht. Oibreoidh ár gcomhairleoirí lena n-údaráis áitiúla

chun Plean Gníomhaíochta um Sholáthar Tithíochta a fhorbairt, agus spriocanna sainiúla ann le haghaidh tithe sóisialta agus inacmhainne. Tabharfaidh ár gcomhairleoirí an t-údarás áitiúil chun cuntais maidir lena spriocanna tógála.

Coinneoidh Fine Gael an scéim Cabhair le Ceannach agus scéim an Chéad Tí, dhá thaca ríthábhachtacha chun cuidiú le daoine a dteach féin a cheannach.

Leanfaimid le creidmheas cánach ar chíos a mhéadú chun cuidiú le daoine airgead a shábháil dá n-éarlais.

Is mian le Fine Gael cuidiú le daoine tógáil ar a dtalamh féin.

2. Tacaíocht a thabhairt do Ghnólachtaí Beaga agus don Fhiontraíocht

Bhí ionadaithe Fhine Gael agus an Chomhairle um Ghnólachtaí Beaga & Fiontraíocht de chuid Fhine Gael ag taisteal ar fud na tíre, ag éisteacht le gnólachtaí agus faoi na dúshláin a bhíonn rompu. Nuair a toghadh mar cheannaire é, gheall Simon Harris TD chun pacáiste a thabhairt chun tosaigh chun tabhairt faoi chostais atá ag méadú do ghnólachtaí beaga, agus laistigh de roinnt seachtainí, rinne sé an beart de réir a bhriathair.

D’oibrigh ár bhfoireann Airí Peter Burke, Heather Humphreys, Patrick O’Donovan, Paschal Donohoe agus Emer Higgins le cheile chun plean 15 phointe a fhorbairt, lena soláthraítear cinnteacht agus faoiseamh lena bhfuil géarghá, bunaithe ar aiseolas ó ghnólachtaí ó cheann ceann na tíre.

Ní hé sin ach tús. Faoi Fhine Gael, cinnteoimid go ndéantar measúnú ar gach cinneadh a ghlacfaidh an Rialtas maidir lena thionchar ar fhiontair bheaga agus mheánmhéide.

Forbróimid comhaontais idir oideachas agus fiontraíocht, ag díriú go sainiúil ar riachtanais an réigiúin. Cuideoimid le huasoiliúint agus le hathsciliú oibrithe a mhaoiniú agus an costas á bhaint ón bhfostóir.

Déanfaimid rátaí tráchtála a athchóiriú.

3. Beart nua do cheantair thuaithe na hÉireann agus d’fheirmeoirí

Tá níos mó airgid á infheistiú againn i gceantair thuaithe na hÉireann ná riamh.

Is é Fine Gael a chuir an Roinn Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail ar bun agus tá raon deontas, scéimeanna agus cistí á chur i bhfeidhm go céimneach aici atá ag athrú ár sráidbhailte, ár mbailte agus ár gcathracha ó bhonn.

Forbróidh Fine Gael tacaíochtaí praiticiúla chun cuidiú leis an bpobal feirmeoireachta.

Is cuid ríthábhachtach dár ngeilleagar í an talmhaíocht agus ní mór cúiteamh agus meas a thabhairt ar shaothar feirmeoirí.

Rinneamar 15 chruinniú a thionól le feirmeoirí ar fud na tíre - chun éisteacht leo agus chun an imní atá orthu a thuiscint. Tá sraith moltaí forbartha anois ag ár ngrúpa talmhaíochta agus tá sé beartaithe againn iad a chur i bhfeidhm thar an meántéarma. D’éisteamar le himní maidir le comharbas agus scor mar aon le himní eile atá os gcomhair an phobail feirmeoireachta.

Faoi cheannaireacht Simon Harris, ba mhian linn páirt a ghlacadh i gcomhpháirtíocht nua maidir le talmhaíocht ina mbeidh feirmeoirí ina gcuid dhílis de na hathruithe atá á ndéanamh againn.

4. Dlí agus ord a fhorfheidhmiú

Seasfaidh Fine Gael i gcónaí do dhlí agus ord. Is muidne an páirtí a chuir an Garda Síochána ar bun. Is ionann vóta ar son Fhine Gael agus vóta ar son páirtí a sheasann gualainn ar ghualainn le fir agus le mná an Gharda Síochána agus leis na teaghlaigh a thacaíonn leo. Rinne an páirtí seo roinnt beart chun tacú le Gardaí ar an stádar agus déanfaimid níos mó.

Tá pionóis maidir le coireacht scine á méadú againn. Tá ceamaraí éide á gcur in úsáid againn do Ghardaí i Lár Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, i bPort Láirge, agus i Luimneach in 2024, agus cuirfear i bhfeidhm go céimneach iad ina dhiaidh seo ar fud na tíre.

Tá úsáid drugaí ina cúis le dochar tromchúiseach do phobail agus do theaghlaigh ar fud na tíre. Tá Fine Gael tiomanta do dhul i ngleic leis sin. Oibreoimid le pobail chun dul i ngleic le húsáid drugaí i mbailte agus i sráidbhailte ar fud na tíre. Trí obair a dhéanamh leis an nGarda Síochána agus le teaghlaigh, leanfaimid lena chinntiú go gcuirtear daoine ar an eolas faoi na contúirtí a bhaineann le húsáid drugaí agus faoi na torthaí ar dhrugaí a cheannach.

Déanfaimid úsáid orduithe um iompar frithshóisialta (ASBOnna) a neartú chun na dúshláin a chomhrac a bhaineann le hiompar frithshóisialta.

5. Córas imirce atá dian agus cóir

Coimeádfaidh Éire córas imirce atá dian, cóir agus forfheidhmithe agus déanfaimid sin ar aon dul le dlí idirnáisiúnta agus le cearta bunúsacha. Tuigimid go maith gur mian le pobail lámh a bheith acu i gcúrsaí ach ní raibh an córas go dtí seo maith go leor, agus cuireadh brúnna míchothroma ar phobail ar fud na tíre.

Tá an Taoiseach Simon Harris i gceannas ar iarrachtaí chun a chinntiú go mbíonn gníomhaireachtaí stáit uile ag obair go héifeachtach le chéile.

Bogfaimid ó úsáid éigeandála óstán chun cóiríocht a chur ar fáil don lucht iarrtha tearmainn. Níl sé inghlactha gur féidir an t-aon óstán atá ag feidhmiú i mbaile a bhaint de phobal thar oíche.

Tá an Rialtas ag obair chun saoráidí a chur ar bun dóibh

siúd atá ar lorg cosanta ar thalamh an stáit. Ní chuirfimid suas lena thuilleadh moilleanna neamhriachtanacha ar thalamh an stáit a chur ar fáil do chóiríocht.

Ní féidir linn agus níor cheart dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh ar thairbhí na himirce. Tá ár ngeilleagar tógtha ar bhonn oscailte: teastaíonn oibrithe uainn i ngach earnáil amhail talmhaíocht agus inár seirbhís sláinte agus chun tithe a thógáil. Ní mór dúinn cuidiú leo siúd atá i ngátar agus ní féidir linn sin a dhéanamh gan chórais atá bunaithe ar rialacha lena gcuirtear deireadh leis na dronga gáinneála coiriúla.

Aithnímid nach ndearna muid gach rud mar is ceart, ach cuireann páirtithe polaitiúla áirithe ráitis nach bhfuil ag teacht le chéile amach nuair a bhíonn imirce i gceist. Ar lá amháin, teastaíonn a thuilleadh imirceach uathu, ach an lá dár gcionn teastaíonn deireadh le teorainneacha oscailte uathu. Ní bhainfimid leas as imirce ar mhaithe le cúrsaí polaitíochta. Díreoimid ar bheart sciobtha a dhéanamh chun leas na ndaoine uile in Éirinn.

6. Seirbhísí poiblí níos fearr arna maoiniú ag geilleagar láidir

Mar gheall ar bhainistíocht chúramach an airgeadais phoiblí ag Fine Gael, anois táimid in ann leibhéil airgid níos mó ná riamh a chaitheamh ar an mbonneagar agus airgead a chur i leataobh do na glúnta le teacht. I mbliana, tá €13 mhilliún á gcur ar fáil le haghaidh infheistíochta chun a thuilleadh scoileanna, tithe, bóithre agus ospidéal a chur ar fáil.

De réir mar atá foghlamtha againn, ní bhíonn seirbhísí níos fearr ina dtoradh ar mhaoiniú méadaithe i gcónaí.

Oibreoimid ar leibhéal áitiúil agus náisiúnta chun cáilíocht na seirbhísí a fheabhsú i raon réimsí, ó chúram do leanaí agus míchumas, go hoideachas agus iompar.

Ní mór dúinn ár mbonneagar bóithre a chothabháil agus infheistíocht a dhéanamh in iompar poiblí. Déanfaidh Fine Gael a dhícheall freisin chun rochtain ar scéimeanna rothar a fheabhsú ar fud na tíre, lena n-áirítear scéim nua um dhul ar rothar go coláiste.

Is é Fine Gael an páirtí a sholáthair na hOllscoileanna Teicneolaíochta do na réigiúin. Beidh Fine Gael ina pháirtí chun infheistíocht a dhéanamh i ngach OT chun a chinntiú go rachaidh gach ceann acu ó neart go neart.

Creideann Fine Gael gur cheart an t-airgead uile a bhailítear ar bhonn áitiúil trí Cháin Mhaoine Áitiúil a choinneáil laistigh den chontae. Teastaíonn uainn freisin rogha na gcomhairleoirí a choimeád chun ráta na Cánach Maoine

Áitiúla a shocrú dá gceantar féin. Tá sé tuillte ag íocóirí cánach go mbíonn a fhios acu cén áit a bhfuil a gcuid airgid á caitheamh. Oibreoidh Fine Gael ar leibhéal áitiúil agus náisiúnta chun sonraí a thabhairt duit faoin áit a bhfuil do chuid airgid á caitheamh.

7. Pobail Shláintiúla agus Inbhuanaithe

Tá ról tábhachtach ag údaráis áitiúla maidir le pobail a chruthú ar mhaith linn bheith inár gcónaí iontu, obair a dhéanamh iontu agus clann a thógáil iontu

Trí leibhéil infheistíochta níos mó ná riamh i Sláinte, spreagfaidh Fine Gael comhoibriú níos mó idir na Réigiúin Sláinte nua agus údaráis áitiúla chun tabhairt faoi riachtanais sláinte gach réigiúin.

Beidh comhairleoirí in ann cur le raon agus le hoibriú na seirbhísí sláinte áitiúla trí Fhóraim Réigiúnacha Sláinte. Sa chur chuige nua sin, beidh guthanna ionadaíocha láidre níos tábhachtaí ná riamh, agus cinnteoidh Fine Gael go mbeidh an fhoireann againn chun labhairt ar son seirbhísí sláinte áitiúla níos fearr.

Beidh sé mar phríomhghealltanas ag comhairleoirí Fhine Gael ár sráideanna a choinneáil glan, dul i ngleic le dumpáil mhídhleathach agus rochtain ar ghabhdáin a fheabhsú.

Maoineoidh Fine Gael soilsiú poiblí feabhsaithe, rochtain níos fearr ar pháirceanna madraí, agus cinnteoidh sé go gcuirfear spásanna súgartha agus áineasa nua agus nuálacha ar fáil i ngach contae - i gceantair uirbeacha agus thuaithe araon.

Méadóimid maoiniú do leabharlanna agus do shaoráidí spóirt i ngach contae.

Cinnteoimid go mbainfidh ár bpobail tairbhí as ár rath eacnamaíoch trí fhorbairt réigiúnach chothromaithe chun a chinntiú go mbainfidh pobail leas as tionscadail fuinnimh in-athnuaite ar an mórchóir agus ar an mionchóir. Oibreoimid ar dhóigheanna nua chun ligean d’acmhainn an gheilleagair chiorclaigh agus bainistíocht dramhaíola a fheabhsú.

Tá ár gcomhairleoirí tiomanta freisin do dhul i dteagmháil le daoine faoi mhíchumas agus le heagraíochtaí míchumais agus d’éisteacht leo ionas gur féidir linn oibriú le cheile chun a chinntiú go n-oibríonn ár mbailte agus ár gcathracha ar son gach duine.

More homes, more home ownership

Fine Gael is the party that got homebuilding off the ground after the financial crisis. We are now building over 32,000 homes per year, compared to fewer than 7,000 homes when Fine Gael entered government in 2011. Social housing building has recovered from a little over 1,000 per year in 2011, to over 8,000 per year now, the highest since the 1970s.

We need to build much more, especially starter homes for young people. We want to build 250,000 homes over the next five years.

Build more homes

Fine Gael will:

• Develop a credible Housing Delivery Action Plan for each local authority, with specific targets for social and affordable homes.

• Work to develop an up-to-date nationwide audit of land. We believe there should be a map and list of zoned, zoned and serviced and unzoned land for each local authority area which is publicly available, easily accessible and regularly updated. This will help increase transparency and inform policymaking. It is essential that there is enough housing land available in the right places to fulfil the ambition of the National Planning Framework.

• Promote new housing developments, unlike other political parties.

• Empower the Land Development Agency, our State-owned land developer, to unlock State lands and ensure there is better engagement between it and the local authorities.

• Take a practical approach to one-off housing which recognises the value of building thriving communities,

especially in rural Ireland.

• Ensure every local authority has a full-time Vacant Homes Officer and prioritise this work.

• Request each local authority to have an up-to-date plan for unlocking serviced sites – that is, serviced sites with the necessary infrastructure in place, such as electricity, water and wastewater.

Deliver more social housing

• Work to deliver a quicker turnaround of social housing that becomes vacant (voids) and ensure social housing is well maintained.

• Work to release new housing more quickly, cutting down on the delays like water connections that can occur.

• Back choice-based letting. We want all local authorities to adopt and promote choice-based letting, whereby social housing stock is openly advertised, allowing applicants to register an interest.

• Fund the Local Authority Home Loan for the next five years.

• Ensure local authorities acquire approximately 1,500 social homes each year under the Tenant in Situ Scheme. This applies when a tenant in receipt of social housing receives a Notice of Termination due to the landlord’s intention to sell the property.

More home ownership

Fine Gael will:

• Extend the Help to Buy Scheme for five more years, helping first time buyers with the cost of their deposit.

• Extend the First Home Scheme, helping first time buyers bridge the gap between their deposit and mortgage and the price of their new home.

• Seek to prevent the bulk purchase of homes. We have already introduced measures to prevent this practice and we will keep them under active review.

Protect Renters

• Ensure local authorities are monitoring compliance with specific planning permissions for certain private student housing developments. 51-week leases are not desirable for the vast majority of students.

• Continue to promote apprenticeships to build the workforce needed to deliver the housing we need.

• Build better links between further education, universities and technological universities to deliver the skillsets we need to meet our housing needs.

• Continue to increase the Rent Tax Credit.

• Work to keep landlords in the market. For every renter, there has to be a landlord, and we will work to ensure landlords are encouraged to provide predictable, longer-term tenancies.

• Work to help families avoid entering emergency

accommodation and help them exit it as soon as possible if they do.

Reform

• Examine if staged payments of the very successful Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant can be introduced as part of a comprehensive review of the scheme.

• Explore the possibility of allowing businesses to use the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, or a new version of the grant, to bring a vacant or derelict commercial building back into commercial use.

• Work with local authorities to improve and promote the Town Centres First policy and draw down all available funding streams.

• Work to repurpose ‘over the shop’ spaces, extending the current planning regulations to exempt these spaces from planning permission to 2030.

• Work with local and national government to see what further financial supports can be provided to make converting over the shop spaces into residential homes more viable.

• Work to roll out the various new measures contained in the Planning and Development Bill, once enacted. This is the largest overhaul of planning law in a generation, designed to bring greater clarity, consistency and certainty to how planning decisions are made.

Backing Small Business

and Enterprise

Fine Gael ministers and the Fine Gael Small Business & Enterprise Council have been travelling around the country, listening to businesses about the challenges that they face.

When elected leader, Simon Harris TD promised to bring forward a package to address rising costs for small businesses and within weeks, he delivered.

Our team of Ministers Peter Burke, Heather Humphreys, Patrick O’Donovan, Paschal Donohoe, Emer Higgins and Neale Richmond worked together to develop a 15-point plan, which provides certainty and some much-needed relief to small businesses.

We will continue to engage with our cafes, our butchers, our hairdressers, our publicans and our corner shops. These are the backbone of our local economy and provide much valued employment up and down this country.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure everyone who wants a job can get one.

• Rigorously implement an enhanced SME test at national level to ensure any major new policies do not have an adverse impact on businesses.

• Ensure that the range of planned reforms, such as auto enrolment and the living wage, are sequenced fairly and in such a way that is affordable for viable businesses.

• Enhance the role of Local Enterprise Offices.

• Ensure companies that grow beyond 10 employees continue to be supported and have access to State loans, grants and vouchers.

• Reform commercial rates, enhancing fairness and transparency.

• Work with local authorities to consider how our commercial rates system can facilitate new start-up businesses and discourage vacant units.

• Improve transparency in regard to how commercial rates are spent. This can include housing, public lighting, fire services, the promotion of local economic development, roads, traffic, leisure and community services. Small business owners need to know more.

• Support the continued waiver of street furniture licence fees for tables and chairs associated with outdoor dining.

A new partnership for Rural Ireland and Farmers

Agri-food and Fisheries are an integral part of the Irish economy and society, especially for our rural and coastal communities. The sector contributes strongly to the Irish economy with exports valued at almost €19 billion. This underpins jobs for almost 165,000 people across 135,000 farms, 2,000 fishing vessels and aquaculture sites and some 2,000 food production and beverage enterprises.

Fine Gael is committed to the sector and has a strong team of local councillors and candidates that are experienced in helping farmers and dealing with their issues.

A fair share of CAP funding

Ireland’s CAP Strategic Plan has a budget of just under €10 billion for the 2023-27 period, with about 60% allocated to direct farm income support and 40% to sectoral support and rural development measures.

These funds are crucial to delivering a vibrant agricultural sector.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to secure a well-funded CAP as part of upcoming EU budget negotiations and ensure the voice of farmers is heard during the next set of CAP reforms. This will allow for much needed supports to flow into local communities through a range of farm-gate schemes.

The same is true for the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) which underpins the Common Fisheries Policy.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to ensure Ireland’s coastal communities secure an appropriate share of Fisheries funds. This is so important given the impact of Brexit on the Irish fishing industry. The current programme runs until 2027 with funding of €258 million and it is vital that Irish interests are represented in future negotiations.

Local Authorities working with farmers

County councils have an important role to play in agriculture particularly in the area of environmental legislation and agricultural planning applications. It is crucial to have people at the table who know and understand agriculture.

Fine Gael will:

• Encourage local authorities to engage in a partnership approach with farmers in areas like water quality. Where inspections do take place, they should be proportionate in their approach and there should be a willingness to work with farmers and their representatives. There is an opportunity through the new €60 million Farming for Water EIP to increase co-operation in this area.

Agricultural Shows

Our Agricultural Shows are an integral part of rural life. They support the farming and agri-food industry as well as local artisan producers. We have put in place a €1 million national fund which provides grants to Agricultural Shows to assist them with their running costs.

Fine Gael councillors will:

• Push for further increases in funding for our Agricultural Shows in the years ahead, as resources allow.

Retaining the Nitrates Derogation

The derogation is a critical element to an economically viable operating model for many farms which also requires them to comply with a higher set of standards to protect water quality across the country.

Fine Gael councillors will:

• Work in partnership with Government, state agencies, local authorities, industry and farm organisations to bring forward practical solutions which benefit farmers and help Ireland retain our derogation after 2025.

Enforcing Law and Order

Fine Gael will always stand for law and order. We are the party that founded An Garda Síochána. A vote for Fine Gael is a vote for a party that stands shoulder to shoulder with the men and women of An Garda Síochána and the families that support them.

This party has taken several measures to support Gardaí on the beat and we will do more. Fine Gael will work with families and communities to stop the scourge of drugs and to combat the challenges of anti-social behaviour.

We are investing more than ever before in An Garda Síochána to support a strong and visible police presence.

While there are currently around 14,000 Garda members working around the country – an increase of 9% since 2015 – we want to see more Gardaí on our streets and working in our communities.

Fine Gael will:

• Grow the size of An Garda Síochána and increase the number of Gardaí in every county.

• Deploy body-worn cameras for Gardaí in Dublin City Centre, Waterford, and Limerick in 2024, with nationwide roll-out to follow.

• Use facial recognition technology to help detect serious crime.

• Build modern Garda stations.

• Improve the pay and conditions of members of the force.

• Design a safety plan for each community.

• Drive community safety programmes and interventions that respond to local needs.

• Support more front-line Gardaí, increased Garda visibility and a wider range of policing services for people in their local area.

• Establish the new Community Safety Partnership model in every area in the country.

• Implement new powers to roll out CCTV in key areas to improve public safety.

• Support An Garda Síochána to roll out a nationwide text alert initiative to allow for a new and innovative way to report issues directly to An Garda Síochána.

• Increase penalties for knife crime and strengthening the use of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs).

• Introduce Community Safety Partnerships around the country, to develop Community Safety Plans for every area.

• Expand youth justice and youth diversion measures.

• Introduce Facial Recognition Technology to help investigate and prosecute cases of serious crime.

• Provide the funding necessary to strengthen the equipment available to An Garda Síochána for public order policing, including the deployment of tasers and stronger incapacitant spray.

• Propose solutions to public order and anti-social “wicked problems” through the Local Leadership Programme which brings together local stakeholders in a structured manner.

• Clamp down on the dangerous use of scrambler bikes. We have introduced legislation to provide stronger Garda powers to tackle the use of scramblers. This has resulted in the nationwide seizure of 44 quad bikes and 133 scramblers by An Garda Síochána since the start of 2023. The deployment of body worn cameras on Gardaí will also provide assistance to Gardaí in tackling this issue.

• Work with the new Dog Control Stakeholder Group to ensure local authorities play their part in keeping animals and the public safe.

Alcohol and drug misuse

The impact of alcohol and drug misuse is felt in every community, both urban and rural. The 24 Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces (DATFs) play a vital role in identifying the services required at a local level, while also co-ordinating actions and channelling funding to service providers. Services on the ground are delivered by the HSE as well as Community and Voluntary Sector organisations.

Fine Gael will:

• Enforce laws to tackle the practice of children being groomed into a life of crime by drug gangs.

• Pursue a health-led rather than a criminal justice approach to drug misuse. This aims to provide healthcare and other supports to people suffering from drug addiction.

• Ensure people caught in possession of drugs for sale or supply will continue to face criminal sanction.

• Work to strengthen the effectiveness and public awareness of the drug-related intimidation reporting programme by An Garda Síochána and the National Family Support Network.

Sale and supply of illegal drugs

Drug use is causing serious harm to communities and families across the country. Fine Gael is committed to addressing this. We will work with communities to tackle drug use in villages, towns and cities. Working with An Garda Síochána and families, we will continue to ensure we inform people of the dangers of drug use and the consequences of purchasing drugs.

We are investing record amounts in An Garda Síochána to target those involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs through Operation Tara. Operation Tara has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing across the country. It seeks to disrupt and dismantle the drug trafficking networks that impact on our communities and prosecute those involved at every level.

Fine Gael has increased the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from 10 years to life in prison to tackle those who direct gangland and drug related crime. We have also introduced new legislation criminalising the grooming of children into a life of crime.

Fine Gael will:

• Roll out a support programme to break the link between gangs and the children they try to recruit.

• Strengthen Criminal Assets Bureau’s ability to target the proceeds of crime and speed up the process to dispose of the asset for the benefit of the State.

Dublin City Centre Taskforce

It is time to have pride again in our capital city. The Taoiseach has convened a Dublin City Centre Taskforce bringing together An Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council representatives, the National Transport Authority, business & trade union representatives, community/ service provider representatives and cultural and arts providers.

The goal is to make Dublin City Centre a more thriving, attractive, and safe cityscape; and a desirable location to live, work, do business and visit. Taking an evidence-based approach to its work, the Taskforce will deliver a cohesive and focused list of recommendations to deliver on a shared vision of central Dublin’s public space.

Domestic Violence

The societal impacts from domestic, sexual, gender-based violence (DSGBV) are wide ranging, systemic and have generational impact. It’s imperative that we disrupt, prevent and take a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of DSGBV in our society, in our communities, our workplaces, our governing bodies, protection agencies, public works, our places of education and our homes. Eliminating DSGBV in our communities will have positive impacts to empower families experiencing this form of violence to live free from fear and to move from surviving to thriving. Happier, safer and stronger communities benefit everyone. DSGBV requires an all of society response. We need training, learning and development programmes to upskill people. Everyone who needs refuge accommodation must have access to it.

We will continue to promote the work of the Fine Gael Women’s Network to advance gender equality and the election of more women into public office.

Fine Gael will:

• Double the number of domestic violence refuge spaces as part of our Zero Tolerance Plan to tackle DSGBV.

• Work to ensure domestic violence victims have a point of contact within the Housing Department of the local authority to highlight their specific circumstances. This means the applicant would not have to disclose any traumatic information to administrative staff and the relevant staff can assist the applicant as sensitively as possible.

• Work with local authorities to ensure sufficient pathways from refuges to alternative safe and long-term housing options for women and children.

Firm and Fair Migration

Ireland will maintain a migration system that is firm, fair and enforced. Migration is an unprecedented challenge, but we will meet it by remaining united and taking comprehensive action every day.

Taoiseach Simon Harris is leading efforts to break down silos or “not-my-problem” attitudes to ensure all state agencies and communities are working together. While we work to increase accommodation places for migrants, we will not allow encampments to remain in place for months again. It is unsafe and against the law.

The Government is working to stand up more facilities quickly on state land. We cannot stand for any more unnecessary delays in making state land available for accommodation. We will step up our efforts in this regard across government.

Getting through applications faster is a key lever we control. We have doubled the number of people working on it and slashed the amount of time it takes for decisions. Minister Helen McEntee is taking action to free up 100 more Gardaí from desk duties to work on enforcement, including deportations. People being granted asylum in Ireland will know sooner and people denied will leave sooner. This system works. Since introducing fast-processing, the number of people applying from safe countries has halved. It gives protection quickly to those who need it, while also demonstrating to applicants who don’t need it that there is nothing to gain from going down the asylum route.

We cannot and should not lose sight of the benefits of migration. Our economy is built on being open: we need

workers in all sectors like agriculture, in our health service and to build homes. In all, 66,000 people have permits allowing them to work here — 21,000 of those are caring for our families in hospitals or minding our elderly in nursing homes.

Having once called for an expansion of our asylum system and an increase in the number of refugees we accept, Sinn Féin are now distributing leaflets to households calling for an end to open borders. We won’t play politics on migration. We will focus on taking swift action in the best interests of all people in Ireland.

Talk of enforcing rules on migration can be painted as inhumane, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. We have to help those in need and we cannot achieve that without rules-based systems that dismantle the criminal trafficking gangs.

Fine Gael will move away from the emergency use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. We will work with Government and State agencies to ensure local communities are provided with an appropriate level of extra services if asylum seekers are accommodated in their locality.

Fine Gael’s Intercultural Network is promoting the voices and perspectives of our new communities and those from a migrant background in our party and in politics. We believe more can be done to better integrate migrants into Irish society. For example, we will work to ensure all local authorities have a racism protocol and engage in anti-racism training.

Better Public Services and Infrastructure

Due to Fine Gael’s careful management of the public finances, we are now able to spend record levels on infrastructure, and put money away for future generations through the Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund.

This year, €13 billion is being made available for investment to provide more schools, homes, roads and hospitals.

Fine Gael in Government established the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2017. We are now seeing the fruits of that decision:

• More people are living in rural Ireland than ever before

• More people are working in rural Ireland than ever before and

• More investment is going into rural Ireland than ever before, including an additional €1 billion from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund for towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000 people.

Roads and Active Travel

This year we are investing around €650 million in regional and local roads – up €32m on last year. This is vital investment and will allow for 2,640km of regional and local roads to be maintained to required standards, and a further 2,160km strengthened to improve the overall road quality on the network.

Fine Gael announced a record funding allocation of €40 million for repairs and improvement works on non-public rural roads and laneways under the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS). The funds are for works to be carried out across 2024 and 2025 on roads not normally maintained by the local authorities. This means almost €170 million has been allocated to local authorities under the Scheme since it was re-introduced in 2017.

Fine Gael will continue to advocate for increased investment in road maintenance to improve road

conditions and reduce the risk of crashes.

Fine Gael will continue investing in active travel initiatives that promote safe cycling and walking in towns and cities, and to invest heavily in consistent and reliable public transport.

Some €360 million per year is provided to fund these vital projects, which both reduce congestion in our urban areas while also encouraging people of all ages to walk, cycle or scoot.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to ensure Local Authorities have the greatest level of discretion on which roads projects are prioritised and funded.

• Put in place a roads budget for maintenance from 2025, separate to a new roads building programme.

• Work to provide increased funding for the vital Local Improvement Scheme.

• Continue to provide feedback to central government on how the LIS scheme can be improved, providing greater flexibility to local authorities to better plan their work programmes in more favourable weather.

• Drive delivery of active travel and greenways programmes through our local authorities.

• Work with schools to avail of funding through the Safe Routes to School Programme. This programme funds ‘front of school’ infrastructure to improve access and safety, improves walking and cycling infrastructure and expands cycle parking.

• Promote a universal design approach in active travel, safe routes to school, greenways and local transport options to improve accessibility and increase the number of people, including people with disabilities, who can participate fully and independently in our communities.

• Promote the take-up of walking and cycling where

possible through better infrastructure. Any new cycleways or segregated pathways must be introduced with community support. They must also take the needs of people with restricted mobility into account.

• Work with constituents and local authorities to deliver the BusConnects programme in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and in such a way that has community support. BusConnects is reimagining the way we get around and helping meet climate targets.

• Work with the National Transport Authority to devise new ways to support the provision of local taxis in rural and urban Ireland.

Best start for every child

Fine Gael has ensured that investment in high-quality Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) is at an-all time high, meaning that parents’ costs are reducing, quality has improved and we are providing additional assistance for children with a disability and who are experiencing disadvantage. We must also support the further development of childcare facilities.

Each local authority should develop a local strategy to support the best start for every child in their area, informed by national policy.

Fine Gael will:

• Support City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) which work with early education and childcare service providers, and which are often the first point of contact for providers and parents.

• Ensure the important functions of the City/County Childcare Committees are maintained and enhanced once the new dedicated state agency for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) in Ireland is established.

• Task local authorities with agreeing Sports Partnerships between sports clubs and schools to develop new facilities and achieve better utilisation of existing facilities. This will be facilitated by a protocol developed between the Departments of Education and Sport.

• Seek to expand and develop our network of Family Resource Centres.

While overall capacity in the childcare sector has increased, so too has demand and there are indications that capacity is not being fully utilised, particularly childcare facilities built by developers as part of larger residential developments that are now lying idle. This is causing significant stress and difficulty for parents. In other instances, the required childcare facility is not yet built, even though all the new homes have been.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure updated planning guidelines for the development of childcare facilities are published in draft form for public consultation in 2024.

• Advocate that ‘Technical Guidance’ should be provided to local authorities for each type of childcare facility, similar to what the Department of Education has for school buildings. These regulations must be mandatory in nature.

• Strengthen the role of planning authorities in relation to childcare places and strengthen local Childcare Committees.

• Implement effective assessment and decision-making on planning applications in relation to childcare.

• Explore the proposal to introduce a new model of state acquisition for childcare facilities built by developers as part of large-scale residential development. A new model could build on learnings from the existing Part V requirement, which compels developers to include social and affordable housing in new developments.

• Explore the possibility of co-locating childcare provision in new school developments.

Education

Fine Gael believes in equality of opportunity for all and believes education is the greatest leveller in society.

Fine Gael has overseen record investment in our school building programmes and opened more special schools than any other Government.

This party also established the Technological Universities in our regions ensuring students do not have to travel long distances to access third level education.

We will also be the party to invest in TUs to ensure students choose to study and live in the regions.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure that the Department of Education engages with local authorities regularly so that we are planning for school place demand, particularly in areas with significant new residential developments.

• Request the Department of Education to produce an annual report for each local authority area setting out the existing school capacity within the local authority and the planned school capacity in five, ten and fifteen years and the population projections underlying those.

• Work with our Technological Universities to deliver student accommodation in the regions.

• Forge links between education and enterprise to address the skills needs in the region and attract jobs and investment.

• Work with the Education and Training Boards to develop apprenticeship and training facilities that are fit-for-purpose.

More transparency on your Local Property Tax

Fine Gael believes all money collected locally through the Local Property Tax should be retained within the local authority. We also want to maintain councillors’ discretion to decide the rate for their area. Taxpayers deserve to know where their money is being spent.

Prior to setting the Local Property Tax, it is a statutory requirement that a local authority undertakes a public consultation on the matter. This is being done, but it seems these consultations are public in name only. Each taxpayer should receive a report annually, informing them how the LPT was spent in the previous year and seeking their views on the proposed changes to the LPT. This consultation will provide LPT payers with specific information about what the different changes to the LPT will mean for them.

Fine Gael will:

• Work with local authorities and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure LPT payers receive a report on how LPT revenue is being spent, broken down by sector.

Flood relief and defence measures

€1.3 billion is being invested in flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan to protect homes, farms and businesses under threat from river and coastal flood risk.

Fine Gael will:

• Step up engagement between the local authorities and the OPW to speed up the number of schemes at design, planning and construction stage.

• Ensure interim measures are put in place for communities at immediate risk of flooding.

Rural Water Schemes

Fine Gael will:

• Work to improve the waste water collection and treatment needs of villages and settlements without access to public waste water services.

• We will seek further funding nationally and ongoing planning for such works at local authority level.

• Ensure there is an adequate water improvement funding stream under the National Development Plan.

Energy

Decarbonising our energy system will bring huge benefits to consumers and local communities, leading to cheaper bills in the long run and better security of supply. We will ensure that the State and local authorities do their part but also that individuals are empowered to make their own contribution.

As we step up our level of ambition on renewable energy, we must ensure that local authorities and other national bodes are adequately resourced and skilled to deal with the strategic and practical planning required.

Fine Gael will:

• Undertake a communications campaign locally, to help people get the best use out of their smart meter to save money on their energy costs.

• Install solar panels in all suitable schools that wish to have them.

• Review the capacity of the Sustainable Energy Communities in each local authority area, looking at how we can grow and implement even more ambitious plans. There are 800 Sustainable Energy Communities around the country.

• Install solar panels or district heating in all public buildings that are suitable for the technology.

• Continue the support schemes to help medically vulnerable households install solar panels on their homes to keep their energy costs down.

• Pilot two group retrofitting projects in each local area, where we will offer a group of neighbours the option to retrofit their homes together and help them through the process. We will take the learnings from those projects and expand as appropriate.

• Ensure that when social homes are being retrofitted in an area that all local private homes in the same estate have the option of retrofitting their home, at a cost adjusted for the grants that are available, where feasible.

• Continue to provide substantial grants of up to 50% for those who wish to retrofit their homes.

• Insist on communities benefitting from renewable energy generation in each local authority area.

Healthy and Sustainable Communities

Fine Gael is the party of community.

We have worked over successive Governments to invest in towns and villages, to invest in community centres, sports facilities and libraries.

Fine Gael councillors will work with communities to deliver for you and your family.

Fine Gael will:

• Support Ireland’s network of post offices and ensuring the potential of the network is fully utilised to benefit local communities.

• Work to expand the services provided by credit unions.

• Support new legislation to provide continued sufficient access to cash and to ensure that the future of evolution of cash infrastructure is managed in a fair and transparent manner for consumers.

• Deliver high speed fibre broadband to 1.1m people across homes, farms and business in all 26 counties by end 2026.

• Work to surpass the target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025.

• Push for dedicated space within these hubs for local entrepreneurs and start-ups.

• Work to ensure that adequate childcare measures are put in place to support access to remote working hubs.

Reform of local health structures

As part of Sláintecare, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is undergoing major structural reform, splitting into six operational areas, called Health Regions.

Fine Gael will:

• Encourage greater co-operation between the new Health Regions and local authorities in planning health infrastructure projects.

• Ensure that the planning and consenting process is completed as quickly as possible, working in conjunction with local authorities.

• Promote greater use of existing local authority facilities for new community health services.

• Ensure councillors can input on the range and operation of local health services through Regional Health Forums. In this new approach, strong representative voices will become even more important, and Fine Gael will ensure that we have the team to advocate for better local health services.

• Work to further expand the network of 174 Primary Care Centres which are already operating across the country. Continue to invest in the Enhanced Community Care (ECC) Programme which is delivering more care at home and in the community, preventing admissions to hospitals.

• Work to improve access to GP services in rural Ireland, our towns and cities and invest more in general practice

• Work alongside pharmacists to expand their roles for the benefit of everyone. Community pharmacists already play a significant role in providing care in our communities, but we understand that pharmacists can and want to do more for their communities.

• Support increased funding for mental health services.

Cleaner Communities

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure all households, including apartments, have access to a compost bin.

• Ensure each local authority develops a Circular Strategy for their area targeting transformation in food, construction and durable consumer goods.

• Utilise all tools in our power to crack down on dumping black spots, including the use of CCTV. Illegal dumping is a scourge on society.

• We will examine introducing SMART enforcement of our waste laws, such as the use of drones, to identify illegal activity.

• Develop and implement a plan to provide alternatives to the practice of plastic rubbish bags being put out on the street in urban areas. This is leading to litter and obstructed walkways.

• Ensure each local authority will upgrade one of its bring centres to become a Rediscovery Centre, where people can avail of services to carry out repairs, share or exchange equipment and spare parts and get information and advice.

• Use our enforcement powers and improve facilities to reduce littering and improve our overall ranking on the Litter Pollution Index (LPI).

• Minimise waste in all aspects of local authority work, recognising the need to lead the way.

• Increase litter inspections.

• Examine increasing fines for littering and illegal dumping.

Vibrant Towns and Villages

Fine Gael has spearheaded unprecedented investment in our rural communities in recent years. Historic and vacant buildings are being brought back into use through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure a strong pipeline of local projects under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.

• Work with local authorities to ensure they are proactive in identifying and repurposing vacant and derelict sites.

• Push for further rounds of funding for the innovative Streetscape Enhancement Scheme.

• Push for further rounds of the Community Centre Investment Fund in the years ahead.

• Promote accessibility and inclusion through universal design in upgrades to community centres.

• Recognise projects that use universal design to promote and support participation for all members of our communities including people with disabilities.

• Push for continued increases in Tidy Towns funding in the years ahead, as resources allow.

• Support the establishment of a national Women’s Shed network.

• Push for progressive increases in grants for Men’s Sheds.

Sports Capital Grants

The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) develops sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment in every community around Ireland. It has helped over 13,000 projects with over €1 billion in funding.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure Sports Capital schemes are adequately funded into the future.

• Work with local authorities and clubs to ensure applications are in order and eligible.

• Recognise projects that use universal design to promote and support participation for all members of our communities including people with disabilities.

Better access to sports facilities

Fine Gael recognises the importance of our local sports clubs to our rural communities. We want to ensure people of all ages and abilities can enjoy watching sport in their community. Following engagement with Fine Gael Councillors, Minister Heather Humphreys, this year, introduced new grant aid to support the upgrade of spectator stands at local sports grounds helping to improve access for older people and people with disabilities.

As highlighted in a recent motion passed at our party’s Ard Fheis, more playgrounds, parks and playing fields are needed in both rural and urban locations. This issue can be particularly acute in parts of cities where open green spaces are at a premium.

Fine Gael will:

• Seek further rounds of funding to upgrade access to sports grounds for older people and people with disabilities.

• Promote holistic support programmes for children with additional needs and include proven sports and physical activity programmes.

• Work with local authorities to either acquire or re-purpose land for playgrounds, parks and playing fields.

Libraries

Our libraries are at the heart of our towns and villages with over 300 facilities nationwide.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to treble the number of My Open Library facilities nationwide. My Open Library allows library members the freedom and flexibility to use the library at times that suit them.

• Work with Government and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to expand the Little Library initiative, where every 4-5 year old child is invited to visit their local library and collect a free bag of books and become library members. It is estimated that 30,000 children have joined their local library as a result of this scheme.

• Invest in the development of sensory spaces in our libraries, as well as sensory gardens under the CLÁR Programme.

• Promote initiatives that provide access to audible books, quiet times for people with autism, and access to assistive devices rental schemes.

Seniors Alert Scheme

The Seniors Alert Scheme is designed to support vulnerable older people in our communities. It provides funding for a personal monitored alarm so that our senior citizens can live securely in their homes with peace of mind.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to develop a major awareness campaign to promote the benefits of the scheme.

An Ghaeltacht

Fine Gael recognises the importance of the Irish language to our culture and national identity. We want it to be a living language, used in daily life throughout our communities. As highlighted in a motion at our recent Ard Fheis, housing and planning policy must protect Gaeltacht communities.

Fine Gael will:

• Promote the use of the Irish language in workplaces and social settings, especially outside Gaeltacht areas.

• Prioritise the work of Údarás na Gaeltachta in strengthening the identity and branding of our Gaeltacht areas.

• Work to ensure planning guidelines and development plans preserve Gaeltacht communities in terms of housing provision.

Aithníonn Fine Gael tábhacht na Gaeilge dár gcultúr agus dár bhféiniúlacht náisiúnta. Is mian linn go mbeidh sí ina teanga bheo, a úsáidtear i saol laethúil ar fud ár bpobal. De réir mar a díríodh aird air i rún ag ár nArd-fheis le déanaí, ní mór pobail na Gaeltachta a chosaint trí bheartas tithíochta agus pleanála.

Déanfaidh Fine Gael an méid seo a leanas:

• Úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn in áiteanna oibre agus i suíomhanna sóisialta, go háirithe iad siúd atá lasmuigh de cheantair na Gaeltachta.

• Tús áite a thabhairt d’obair Údarás na Gaeltachta chun féiniúlacht agus brandáil ár gceantair Ghaeltachta a neartú.

• Obair a dhéanamh chun a chinntiú go gcaomhnaítear pobail Ghaeltachta le treoirlínte pleanála agus pleananna forbartha.

Developing local tourism

Tourism is a vital component of the local economy throughout the country. Access via land, sea and air is crucial in ensuring balanced growth in tourism.

Fine Gael will:

• Work with other local authorities, north and south of the border, on developing new tourism initiatives and upgrading existing initiatives.

• Improve access to tourism destinations around the country by working with local authorities and national bodies.

Water safety

We welcome the increased interest in open water swimming in recent years and will work on ways to promote it. Open water swimming promotes community

engagement and good mental health, but it also comes with risks.

Fine Gael will:

• Ensure local authorities are using their powers to issue on-the-spot fines and minimise the possibility of dog fouling making its way into open waters.

• Ensure popular destinations are adequately resourced with lifeguards at the most important times.

• Work with Water Safety Ireland to promote public awareness of water safety, and minimise accidents in water.

• Work with local authorities and local sports partnerships to develop improved swimming infrastructure.

Supporting the arts

At a national level, Fine Gael has doubled spending on the arts, culture and sport over the past seven years. Local authorities have a crucial role in supporting the arts, in organising events and festivals and creating new spaces for artists to be creative.

Fine Gael will:

• Build on recent positive initiatives to create new working spaces for artists.

• Work with the OPW to examine if unused buildings could temporarily be used by artists for working and performance spaces.

• Work to simplify the processes involved in organising festivals, from licencing, to traffic management and insurance.

Supporting local media

Local media needs our support. It is a cornerstone of a well-functioning democracy.

At a national level, Fine Gael Oireachtas Members Richard Bruton, Micheál Carrigy Jerry Buttimer and Ciarán Cannon undertook a detailed survey and analysis on the local media landscape nationwide and received feedback from key stakeholders, culminating in a submission to the Future of Media Commission.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to support local media and ensure that funding is in place so that local authority business can be reported and the public is informed of important decisions being taken in their locality.

Sustainable communities

Climate change is the biggest challenge facing this generation. We are rising to the challenge. Fine Gael in local government will lead by helping and supporting people to make the changes needed to reduce emissions in a fair and equitable way.

Fine Gael will:

• Put in place an ambitious plan for the next 5 years, which will help our communities feel the benefits of climate action, while protecting our cities, towns and villages from its worst effects. It will include measures on adaptation, energy use and how we can best help and support individuals make the changes required.

• Task each local authority with developing a ‘Green Audit’, looking at all its suppliers in receipt of contracts above a certain value as part of a drive to achieve higher levels of sustainability in its supply chain.

• Develop demonstration Mobility Hubs in each local authority area, with EV charging points, car-sharing opportunities and electric bikes.

• Develop a decarbonising zone in each local authority which will see a 75% carbon reduction in that area by 2030 using a combination of the following: improved pedestrianisation and cycling facilities, mobility hubs, renewable energy, initiatives to cut down on packaging, reduce waste and improve repair options.

Biodiversity

We need a step change in the way we think about nature and how to protect it for future generations.

Fine Gael will:

• Request that the National Biodiversity Plan set geographic targets and enter partnership with local authorities to coordinate their delivery.

• Work with each local authority to assess biodiversity status of natural assets in the county and set out actions for regeneration of same as part of county development plans.

• Place bees on the roofs of local authority owned buildings, where practical.

• Work with each local authority to eliminate the defects highlighted by the EPA in its environmental enforcement activities.

• Work with the local authority to develop a project focused on a chosen demonstration river catchment in the local area. The project will look at ways to improve water quality and biodiversity, as well as reducing flooding risk and the response to flooding incidents.

Playgrounds and other recreation facilities

Fine Gael recognises the health benefits of providing play and recreation spaces, including active travel, for young people and adults. We will ensure that new, innovative play and recreation spaces are provided in every county – both urban and rural – and that existing spaces are maintained and refurbished.

We will also ensure that playgrounds are inclusive spaces, where children of all abilities can have fun together.

Nationally, Fine Gael has prioritised providing more outdoor recreation amenities, ranging from outdoor gym equipment to walking trails, cycleways and greenways. Hundreds of projects have been funded in local authorities across the country, and the benefits are obvious. Residents have recreational opportunities close to home and visitors are attracted to the area, providing knock-on business advantages.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to ensure there is a strong Outdoor Recreation Plan developed in every county – rural and urban.

• Ensure local authorities have access to adequate funding to invest in the upkeep of playgrounds falling into disrepair.

• Work with local community groups and the local authority to deliver more play facilities.

• Work to increase the funding available nationally that local authorities can apply for.

• Work with local authorities, community and sports groups to avail of funding under the CLÁR programme.

• Promote inclusive universal design of playgrounds to ensure that children of all abilities can have fun together. Our playgrounds should be a place where every child belongs.

• Advocate for Communications Boards to be installed in every playground and public space building. These boards have proven to be very effective, making it possible for people of all ages who struggle with verbal communication to express their thoughts.

• Seek to provide more parent and child parking spaces adjacent to playgrounds, ensuring that appropriate and adequate signage is installed marking their presence. Improving access to playgrounds is important.

• Ensure childcare facilities and youth spaces are prioritised in the allocation of development levies, which are an important means of funding local infrastructure.

• Strongly advocate that local authorities make vacant spaces available for innovate youth activities and hang out spaces such as coffee clubs.

Smoking and use of e-cigarettes

Fine Gael is committed to reducing smoking rates across the population and is concerned by the increased usage of e-cigarettes and tobacco inhaling products.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to ban the use of tobacco and nicotine inhaling products from all local authority properties, excluding homes.

Positive Ageing

In the past five years the number of people aged 65 and over grew by almost 25%. One of our great success stories as a country is that we can look forward to at least 20 healthy years after we retire. However, we have not done enough to harness this enormous potential. The HSE, the local authorities and other public agencies need to work together and develop more creative and innovative ways to promote positive ageing.

Fine Gael will:

• Increase housing options available to older people to live happy, active lives in their communities.

• Continue to enable Age Friendly Ireland’s work in assisting cities and counties to be more inclusive and respond to the needs of older people. In particular, we will support the Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme which helps people to continue living independently in their home for longer, or in a home more suited to their needs.

• Continue to support the Healthy Age Friendly Homes initiative, between the Department of Health, Sláintecare and Age Friendly Ireland. This establishes the important role of a Local Coordinator, based in local authorities, who acts as a single point of contact for older adults and directs them to health, housing and other services. This will enable people to remain living in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.

• Request each local authority to mandate its County Age Friendly Forum to conduct an audit of existing policy in the county on preparation for retirement, assess barriers to participation, and the range of choices available, with a view to developing an annual programme for the Council to promote their area as the best place to grow older.

• Request each Local Authority to develop a policy to support rightsizing for families whose needs have changed. It should include an examination of rigidity in the planning system to facilitate division or adaptation of properties. It should also include potential partnership with the LDA to acquire centrally located sites that could offer own door accommodation in a secure and supported environment with good access to the community and its services.

• Ensure that Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability are adequately

funded and income thresholds and grant limits are adjusted in line with the cost of living.

• Continue to increase home support hours year on year and continue to make changes to ensure home support workers and healthcare assistants are valued and new entrants are attracted to these professions.

• Introduce a statutory home care scheme.

• Provide adequate funding for in-home dementia day care.

• Continue to support day care and meals on wheels services across the country, which provide vital connections for many older people in our communities.

• Continue our investment in community beds and in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal) for those who need additional care.

Disability

Our councillors are committed to engaging with and listening to people with disabilities and disability organisations so that we can work together to ensure our towns and cities work for everyone. We must work to ensure everyone can use the same facilities, take part in the same activities and enjoy the same experiences.

Fine Gael will:

• Support the employment of Disability Inclusion Officers in all Local Authorities, encourage more disability awareness training for staff and ensure that information from Local Authorities is available in accessible formats.

• Use our councillors’ influence to ensure that universal design is central to all planning and developments, in both the public realm and in housing developments.

• Promote new accessible social housing and adapt existing social housing stock for people with disabilities.

• Ensure that sporting facilities, changing spaces, playgrounds, footpaths, parks, public spaces, and public seating is accessible to all.

• Work constructively with businesses and traders to maintain accessible pathways.

• Ensure footpaths are not blocked by overgrown hedges, signage and micropillars and promote dished kerbs and tactile crossings.

• Promote a review of all disabled parking to ensure sufficient access and pilot a Space Finder App providing real-time information on the location & availability of accessible parking spaces.

Reforming your

County Council

Local authorities carry out vital work on behalf of all Irish citizens and yet many of us are not familiar with what they do, how they work and what services they provide.

We need to ensure county councils evolve quickly to reflect the changing needs and preferences of the public.

Streamlining county council websites

Local authorities’ websites vary in their functionality. Nationally, Government has integrated the various government department websites into gov.ie.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to streamline all local authority websites and improve citizens’ access to vital public services.

• Work on new ways to engage people, especially younger people, through a more systematic approach to digital media.

• Promote better take-up of online services by local authorities. The planning system should be digital insofar as possible. People should have access to everyday services on their phone.

• Retain traditional alternatives, such as phone and counter services, to ensure access for all people.

New skills

From housing, to planning, to small business, to artificial intelligence, county council staff are going to require a broad range of skills for our future needs.

Fine Gael will:

• Work to commission a nationwide audit of what skills and resourcing requirements are needed in our local authorities. We cannot allow skills or labour shortages to hold up vital infrastructure needs in areas like housing.

• Work to ensure that county council staff are representative of our population as a whole – e.g. migrants.

More female participation in local politics

The membership of our local authorities should better reflect Irish society. There are many practical barriers to getting more people to enter public life.

Fine Gael will:

• Campaign for more family friendly and flexible working arrangements.

• Build a culture that promotes safe participation in politics and equips councillors to stand against harassment and abuse.

• Introduce a common policy across all the public service with regard to leave for public representatives – currently there is no consistency across the public service.

• Promote awareness-raising campaigns to increase visibility of women in politics, and build understanding of the role of local councillors and the importance of women’s participation in local politics.

Reflecting a more diverse society

Fine Gael will continue to encourage a diverse range of candidates to stand for election. We will also support the work of Public Participation Networks (PPN) to ensure the views of local community groups are considered as part of the decision-making process of local government.

Fine Gael will:

• Continue to promote the role of members from a migrant or ethnic minority community within our party and help them to run for election.

• Promote the work of Public Participation Networks (PPNs) and work with local authorities to ensure that where members of local PPNs opt to run for election, they do not need to step down their position until they are elected.

• Promote the participation of people with disabilities within our party and ensure accessible and inclusive practices to enable them to run for election.

"Local 2024: Green Party","1. INTRODUCTION

This manifesto is a plan to unleash the power of every community in Ireland.

The threat of the climate crisis underpins this manifesto but it is the opportunity posed by climate action that motivates the ideas within. This is our decade to transform how we live for the benefit of everybody. It’s a chance to re-imagine our lives that we cannot afford to waste.

Laws, budgets and infrastructure may be set at national and international levels. But this all comes to life through local government. Ultimately, the transition to a sustainable, fairer, healthier way of life will be the choice made by communities in every town and village across Ireland. The power lies in each place, one by one. Every local landscape, every community centre, every main street, every school or shop or home and farm matters.

We stand for warm homes, safe streets and clean communities. We know that the way to achieve this is better transport, new energy

production methods and support for nature.

The Green Party is a small presence in most local councils but we can make a big difference. Where there are Green councillors, the council moves and innovative ideas get done. With more local representatives, we will fulfil the promises of our manifesto.

We will restore nature everywhere. We will create parks, community gardens and nature trails. We will clean up our rivers, lakes and the sea.

We will make sure people can move freely on our streets. We will expand pavements and

cycle lanes, new bus routes, slow traffic to make our roads safer. We encourage electric vehicles to make the air cleaner and cut noise.

We will see through a cheap energy revolution. We have brought in the legislation and grants that have already underpinned 100,000 home retrofits. A hundred homes a day are now getting solar panels to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

We will bring streets and town centres to life. We will fight the vacancy and dereliction that blights so many towns. Safe, clean towns along with good street furniture will help small businesses thrive.

We will give power to the community. We support markets, community policing, local citizens assemblies and councils which actively engage with you.

We will respond to crisis with compassion. We live in a time when global crises come to our doorsteps. We support sustainable flood relief, resources for the successful integration of refugees and we stand up to those intimidating the new arrivals.

Local authorities in Ireland have a problem delivering the scale and speed of change in needed to provide local services. The world is moving too fast for us to accept this anymore. Your community needs councillors who believe in change and are not afraid to make it happen.

The Green Party has always taken on vested interests. We fight for clean air and water, both of which are vital for our health and we have always championed good planning at a local level, which is how we can build a strong sense of community.

The stakes have never been higher. We know this is our last chance to tackle the climate emergency. Only the Green Party is truly committed to this cause. Voting Green is the only sure way to guarantee that your community will be safe and prosperous in the decades to come. Voting Green is the only way to ensure people and place thrive together.

2. ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE

2.1. Climate

Protecting and enhancing our natural environment is essential to all life in Ireland and across the world. The Green Party believes that every action we take must be informed by our understanding of the twin crises we face in climate and biodiversity - this underpins every single action we take and every policy in this document.

The changes we need to make in the coming decade are substantial but we believe that they can be hugely beneficial to all of our people - urban, rural, young and old. We know that climate action has to be at the heart of all our

policies. This means that our housing policy delivers warm, affordable houses in strong and vibrant communities; our transport policy ensures that those communities can access zero or low carbon, affordable and reliable transport options;

and our energy policy greatly reduces our costly emissions by ramping up renewables while also giving us complete energy security for future generations.

Climate action presents an opportunity. The resources required to tackle climate change, if properly and adequately mobilised, can serve to improve our quality of life. Climate action can help to promote sustainable development, create new jobs and build communities. By following a communityled development framework, climate action can address local priorities and tackle inequality, which will in turn accelerate positive climate outcomes.

We will:

• Accelerate the retrofit of council homes to enhance energy efficiency, cut down on bills and tackle fuel poverty.

• Promote locally-generated power, including district

heating schemes, and resale of locally-generated power back into the grid, giving a return on local investment in renewable energy generation. We will encourage and facilitate community groups to avail of community renewable energy projects.

• Zone sufficient land for onshore wind and solar and remove barriers to community renewable energy projects.

• Work with the Climate Action Regional Offices, Government and neighbouring councils to reach legally-binding climate targets. We will ensure that local authority Climate Action Plans are robust, fair and build up resilience to climate impacts. All local authorities will publish annual audits of their carbon footprint and issue reports on progress towards achieving their legally-binding climate targets.

• Accelerate the transition to low-energy LED public lighting across the country.

• Provide for EU offices in every local authority, to ensure that councils can apply for all available funding streams. We will promote cooperation between councils to access funding and plan climate projects across boundaries. We will push for enough staff to be

appointed in key areas such as a Trees Officer and Climate Action Officers.

• We will establish local climate action funds in every local authority, to empower community groups to create local solutions to fight the effect of climate change.

• Switch council fleets to electric vehicles with charging infrastructure at all depots.

2.2. Nature Restoration

Our goals are to reverse declines in habitat richness, restore biodiversity, improve water quality in lakes, rivers, streams and coastlines. Other goals include reducing flooding, enriching urban environments, improving air quality, protecting against emerging threats and supporting systemic changes bringing about long-term sustainability for future generations.

We wish to see Ireland blossom again as a country with healthy soils, water and air supporting richer bird, animal, plant and insect life, as it did in the past. We recognise that the health and wellbeing of the biosphere is integral to, and deeply interwoven with, human health and wellbeing.

The Greens in Government have prioritised nature restoration. We created the first ever Minister for Nature, Malcolm Noonan, and under his leadership we have almost doubled the funding for nature and the National Parks and Wildlife Service; established new national parks and marine protected areas; appointed biodiversity officers in every

laws around nature protection, and supported the EU Nature Restoration Law at EU level.

We propose to:

• Create ‘Green your lane/ street’ schemes so that communities can decide to plant pollinator-friendly plants in their area. We will empower neighbourhoods to convert shared street spaces into green amenity space.

• Consider a new mechanism at local level for designation of important sites for ecology to ensure biodiversity is protected and managed. We will introduce Local

and corresponding funds where community groups can work with ecologists and have an active role in nature conservation.

• Take the lead in retention and conservation of hedgerows with appropriate species and sustainable management, and to protect and restore threatened and diminished biodiversity.

• Mainstream the ‘Biodiversity Net Gain’ principle for all counties, whereby developments must make a net positive contribution to habitats and plantlife.

• Commit to restoring native habitats, native forests, bogs and wetlands and to designate areas for rewilding.

• Develop pocket parks which are gardens and community gardens on small, vacant, under-used sites. Increase the number of pollinator-friendly and wildflower areas.

• Require all large developments to include wildlife corridors, to link different habitat areas for animals.

• We will fund local authorities to offer contractors ecology training across a range of habitats as a pre-qualification for procurement.

• Minimise the effect on biodiversity of nighttime lighting, through use of new technologies.

2.3. Waste, Litter, and Recycling

In 2020, we only recycled 29% of plastic packaging overall. Under EU law, we will have to recycle 77% of plastic bottles by 2025 and 90% by 2029. We need to do better to reduce waste and unsustainable consumption.

This year, we introduced the Deposit Return Scheme, which will drastically help us with our recycling and reuse targets. We have also prohibited many single use plastic products. More action is needed at EU, national and local level to reduce the volume of waste created, and the amount that gets into our environment.

We propose to:

• Increase the number and type of bins across the country, including underground waste bins.

• We will prioritise reducing waste first, then reusing and recycling. We will reduce waste sent to

• Work towards publicly provided waste collection services.

• Increase the number of litter wardens and improve the enforcement process, including the use of CCTV and yearly household bulky waste collections to prevent illegal dumping.

• Introduce new measures to tackle dog poo including appropriate numbers of dog waste bins, proper resourcing and administration of dog wardens.

• Ensure that councils lead the way in the reduction and elimination of single-

use plastics like coffee cups and kitchenware at council buildings and events.

• Support local movements like Repair Cafés and swap shops which help people to repair broken or damaged items rather than discard them.

• Extend opening hours for recycling centres, and ensure they are open on Sundays.

• Combat plastic waste on public beaches and coastal areas through expansion of the Deposit Return Scheme at council run sites.

2.4. Water and Flooding

Water is one of our most precious resources. Everyone has the right to sufficient and safe water. Yet communities are still blighted by polluted waterways and coasts, affecting drinking and bathing water quality.

At the same time, the threat of flooding becomes greater every year due to the impact of the climate crisis. These issues are interconnected and require a holistic approach from local authorities.

We propose to:

• Protect homes and businesses in areas where there is high flood risk. We will examine the role council parks and lands can play in reducing risk by storing water during floods and support natural flood management such as tree planting, the renewal of wetlands and other mechanisms to absorb water.

• Introduce permeability via paving, limiting the

and paths, and mandate Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) in all new developments.

• Through our planning system, we will prevent construction on floodplains.

• Continue progress on ending raw sewage discharges in coastal areas. We will introduce a grant scheme supporting infrastructure for the treatment and distribution of water servicing group water schemes and sewage disposal.

• Increase the number of water inspectors to at least one per local authority, for year round testing of bathing and river waters.

• Install thousands of water fountains in our parks, towns and public spaces to provide free access

to clean drinking water and cut down on plastic pollution.

3. FORESTRY AND FOOD

3.1. Trees and Forests

Ireland has far fewer trees than most of our neighbours. We want to protect the forests we have and to grow more trees across all local authorities, urban and rural. In government, we’ve created incentives for to farmers and local authorities to plant mixed native woodlands for improved habitat and water quality.

We propose to:

• Increase native tree planting by councils in public green spaces and on streets. Involve communities in community woodland tree planting days organised by the

councils, where the council selects suitable native tree species and the locations.

• Plant 1 million trees over the next five years. We will push for a Tree Strategy to be published on all of the councils we

sit on, including a longterm urban tree renewal scheme. To complement this, we will employ Trees Officers and protect annual tree-planting and maintenance budgets. We will accelerate the planting of street trees in particular, to improve air quality, carbon abatement and amenity value.

• End excessive tree felling in urban, suburban and rural areas around the country by introducing a better tree preservation order process, and ensure

3.2. Food

that more heritage trees are protected with a ‘prune-first’ approach.

• Push for councils to work with State Agencies to plant more amenity woodlands on public lands and on the edges of towns and villages.

• Work with central government to set minimum requirements for use of timber in construction and renovation of local authority and other publicly owned buildings.

Since 2020, we have trebled the land area being farmed organically, and will increase this to 10% in the coming years. We have created grants to farmers to install solar panels on farm buildings to provide energy for on-farm use and export to the grid, as well as making the planning process simpler.

We want to work on local councils across the country to grow the scope of local food

production, to better connect citizens with their food, and to enhance resilience and community spaces.

We propose to:

• Develop a Sustainable Food Strategy for every council appropriate for the local context, including a composting strategy.

• Include space in County Development Plans for community gardens and allotments. We will introduce a streamlined system for people to apply to their local authority to let and use a community garden, and mandate the local authority to publish

a strategy on increasing the number of community gardens.

• Ban the use of glyphosate by local authorities in public areas, except for appropriate professional use to control invasive species such as Japanese knotweed.

• Help local food growers and artisan producers to sell high quality, sustainably produced food at affordable prices.

4. TRANSPORT

The Green Party wants to facilitate true choice by supporting the development of local, national and all-island public and active transport options. In giving the streets back to people, we can create safer places with less pollution and freedom for individuals and communities to decide how to commute and travel.

That’s why in government, we:

• Reduced public transport fares for the first time since 1947, with a 60% reduction in fares for young people and 90-minute fares in Dublin.

• Flipped the ratio of government investment in transport from 2:1 in favour

of roads to 2:1 in favour of public transport.

• Introduced 60 new and enhanced public transport services in towns and villages across Ireland (more than one new service a week). More than 3.2 million passengers travelled on Local Link services in 2023, an almost

seven-fold increase since 2018.

• Reopened train lines that have been dormant for years.

• Built train stations and increased the frequency of services all over the country.

Cars will always be needed for some of our transport needs. However, currently private cars are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and this is continuing to grow. Cars make up 74% of all journeys, with just 7% of journeys made by bus or rail, 14% by walking and just 2% by cycling. This creates

traffic problems, dangers to other road users and lowers the effectiveness of the alternatives.

With €1 million being spent every day on walking and cycling, Green councillors have been pushing to develop safer and more accessible alternatives.

To continue this, we propose to:

• Work with local communities and businesses to develop transport plans for our cities and towns which are focused on walking, cycling and public transport above further car-centric development.

• Support the expansion of public transport to provide a better experience, with cheaper fares, more frequent and reliable services, and proper bus shelters. We will extend the LEAP card geographical area to create an integrated national travel service so that regular commuters can make significant savings on travel.

• Support a proactive approach to licensing rural bus services and the direct support of existing routes, including school schemes.

• Push for the design and implementation of high quality cycle lanes and inter-connected cycle routes, safe enough for everyone from young children to pensioners to be able to use with confidence. Ensure that temporary works do not cut off access to cycleways and footpaths.

• Supply bike bunkers for urban areas and sheltered bike parking at public

transport hubs. We will introduce 200 new shared EV car and electric bike mobility hubs and introduce EV charging pints in sports clubs and at on street locations in every local authority.

• Establish shared bike schemes in large towns, as has been successful in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Athlone and Mullingar. Promote car and scooter sharing schemes, establishing byelaws to regulate them.

• Plan for more climateresistant roads, requiring all new roads to be assessed for their lifetime emissions.

• Make walking easier and safer. We will invest in wider, quality footpaths with better disability access, modify traffic light timings to allow pedestrians more time to cross with less waiting, and to cross multiple lanes in one go. We will extend the use of zebra crossings

and where pedestrian crossings are signalised, to go green for pedestrians instantly rather than have long wait times.

• Invest in making roads safer with lower speed limits, with a move to 30km/h zones in towns, to protect motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, and reduce crashes. We will make infrastructural improvements to tackle speeding and ensure that roads are designed to prioritise road safety, particularly that of children and other vulnerable road users.

• Divert heavy goods vehicles from city or town centres, outside of delivery areas.

• Champion the introduction of annual car-free days in specific areas, towns and villages to enable local markets and festivals, supporting communities that want car-free neighbourhoods.

• Rollout more charging points for electric vehicles in public spaces and council administered areas.

• Support council parking enforcement to focus on illegal parking at least as much as pay and display parking. We will support differential parking charges based on vehicle emissions and size.

• Change County Development Plans to ensure new developments are inter-connected with walking and cycling permeability.

• Increase the number of properly designed blue badge bays in towns, villages and amenity areas.

5. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

5.1 Homelessness

Homelessness and rough sleeping are an unacceptable human tragedy - the first priority must be prevention. Local authorities need to work with national Government to prevent homelessness before it happens..

This means provision of adequate social housing for those facing homelessness, and in the medium-term the building of more affordable housing and development of secure further tenancy rights. We favour the Housing-First model, with wraparound services for those facing

addiction and other issues.

We propose to:

• Ensure that applications for the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ and Tenant in Situ schemes are processed quickly.

• Consider allowing for the mortgage-to-rent scheme to include cost-rental housing in addition to social housing.

• Push for a new Secure Housing / Homeless Prevention Office in every local authority, which would have input from the housing section of the local authority, the HSE, local Approved Housing Bodies and homeless services. This office would work with people to source new housing in order to avoid them becoming homeless.

• Seek that every local authority receives any notices to quit as issued.

• We will ensure that the additional supports under the Homeless HAP scheme are provided to all those who need it.

• Increase investment in the Housing First programme to ensure that those with complex needs are in supported housing with the necessary wraparound services.

• Improve homeless services and provide more temporary emergency accommodation so people who become homeless have options close to where their lives are. Local authorities should have a leading role in coordinating homeless services.

5.2 Town Centres First: Vacancy and Dereliction

Ireland currently has a major shortage of housing. Equally, we have an affordability crisis as young people struggle to pay high rents. There must be concerted action that works to remove barriers where they exist and to inject capital, momentum and new thinking into national and local housing policy.

Local authorities should provide people with communities; not just housing but the services and opportunities needed to live well. Our core vision for our towns and cities is for them to be vibrant and attractive places to live, work and shop. We support the ‘15-minute city’ model, where all amenities are within walking distance and have worked hard to deliver this across the country, recruiting Town Regeneration Officers for every local authority under the Town Centres First policy. But more effort is needed nationally and locally to make these revitalised towns a reality and unlock the tens

of thousands of vacant and derelict homes.

We propose to:

• Support more robust use of Compulsory Purchase Orders against vacant and derelict sites.

• Push for the expansion of internal council resources to maintain the vacant and derelict sites register. We will give people, through councillors, a role in the designation of derelict sites and in the elimination of exemption rules, fighting to expand the definition of dereliction in law. We will allow for the sale by public

auction of a derelict site if the local authority does not wish to compulsorily purchase the site after a notice period of 12 months.

of responsibility for the collection of the Derelict Sites Levy from the local authority to Revenue to ensure better enforcement.

• Continue to support the Croí Cónaithe scheme to refurbish vacant homes.

• Bring council homes back into use as quickly as possible when they need repairs. We will bring older council-owned buildings and housing into compliance with accessibility and high energy rating standards, where appropriate.

• Support the transfer

• Work to ensure that taxes on vacancy, such as the Vacant Homes Tax and the Residential Zoned Land Tax, adequately capture the right sites and buildings, so that developers are incentivised to provide housing.

• Ensure that our councillors’ votes on Local Property Tax variations will be informed by the need to fund local public services.

5.3 Planning

Good planning is the root of better outcomes in transport, energy, housing and in delivering on our commitments to decarbonise our economy and society. The Greens have fought for transparency, equity and a long-term approach that delivers truly sustainable development since our inception.

We propose to:

• Ensure that there are enough Vacant Homes Officers, architects, planners and Heritage Officers to speed up licensing and decision making on refurbishing old buildings. We will bring in legislation to create a ‘Town Centres First application’, which will allow for a faster and more streamlined process for people to upgrade derelict and long-term vacant buildings.

• Embed a ‘Retrofirst’ policy into our planning system, requiring developers to demonstrate that they cannot suitably restore the

existing building structure before permission is granted for demolition.

• Push for the Passive House Standard in all new buildings as a way of greatly reducing heating demands and the future proofing of existing housing stock.

• We will ensure that new housing is built in appropriate locations, with an emphasis on areas with existing public transport links and near town centres. We will mainstream sustainable planning requirements for new residential schemes, such as providing infrastructure for rainwater

harvesting, local integrated recycling schemes, natural ventilation and green roofs on buildings.

• Encourage the redevelopment of brownfield sites for residential use by providing essential infrastructure, including the compilation of local databases

• Lead the way in sustainable construction by actively reducing the use of carbon-heavy building materials, in favour of more timber and recycled materials.

• Task multidisciplinary Town Teams with developing a town plan that puts people first and that develops safe, playful public spaces.

• Develop a compulsory public register of all publicly and privatelyowned land.

• Introduce more rigorous requirements for large construction sites to reduce air and noise pollution, as well as traffic and road damage. We will ensure noise monitoring systems and enforcement are adequate to protect communities.

5.4 Building Homes and Communities

This Government has built over 100,000 homes, more than the previous two governments combined. More than 32,000 homes were completed in 2023 alone and we expect 40,000 homes to be build this year. We will use every mechanism to continue this increase in house building in every local authority.

Thanks to the Green Party, Ireland has built the first Cost Rental housing schemes where tenants can be sure of affordable rents and lifetime tenancies, and created a “tenant in-situ scheme” where tenants are facilitated to stay in their home when their landlord is selling up. We have fought hard for tenants’ rights, securing tenancies of indefinite duration and increasing notice to quit periods.

We propose to:

• Do everything possible to assist in the construction of new housing in areas of high need. This will require the hiring of more architects, planners,

tenant managers and project managers in local authorities.

• Ensure that local authorities identify potential sites for, and are actively involved in, the delivery of cost-rental and affordable housing.

• Build 100% public housing on public land in Dublin and Cork. Green councillors will vote in favour of social housing and Traveller Accommodation built to high standards.

• Provide greater enforcement on housing quality, rental properties and planning agreements.

• Ensure that a minimum percentage of council housing is fully accessible.

• Consider the establishment of a new ‘empty nester’ scheme to examine the right-sizing of the national housing stock.

• Work with Fáilte Ireland to ensure that any properties

used for short-term rentals have the correct planning permission.

• Increase capacity in local authority fire services so that owners of apartments with construction defects can agree remediation works and quickly access remediation schemes.

6. ECONOMY

6.1. Local Business

We have made it our priority to bring business back to our towns and villages. Greens are working to reverse the trend of out-of-town shopping centres and large online retailers sucking the life out of our communities. We want people living, working and spending money in the centre of our cities, towns and villages, leading to a happier, more sustainable way of life.

Businesses, small and large, want to lead on the transition to a zero-carbon economy. Our job is to create win-winwin situations for businesses, communities and the climate, giving business a helping hand to make the digital transition.

We are planning for the future and giving businesses certainty. We have established a €14 billion Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund to continue building even in the event of a change in economic conditions. We

Broadband Plan so that by 2026, all rural areas will have access to broadband and by 2030, all populated areas in the country will be covered by 5G.

In addition to this, we propose to:

• Increase funding and promotion of Local Enterprise Offices to ensure that they can help small businesses to cut bills and decarbonise and seek coordination between state agencies so that it is easier for businesses to access grants and advice.

• Give better supports to help small businesses to go online and take advantage of the digital transition.

• Support the development of more remote working hubs to allow people to work in the communities that they live in, preventing long commutes and improving quality of life.

• Support a ‘Living over

the shop’ scheme for businesses that wish to make effective use of vacant ‘over the shop’ spaces. Councils would provide advice and support in navigating regulations and best practice to enable owners bring such spaces back into use.

• Introduce more night bus services that will help to support pubs and restaurants in our towns and villages.

• Roll out further measures to allow businesses to trial e-cargo bikes, for faster, cheaper and greener ‘last-mile’ deliveries in urban areas. This will cut air pollution and traffic in our towns.

• Support markets so that small food producers and co-ops can survive, flourish and find a home in our communities. We will back markets for food, crafts, and artisans, so that people can buy local produce and support local producers.

6.2. Cost of doing business

Greens want to see strong local community commercial areas, with small and medium sized businesses supported in their crucial role of providing services and spaces to those living near them.

We must ensure that viable businesses that survived the pandemic and the effects of global events will be supported to continue to employ people and thrive.

We propose to:

• Reduce the Rates Vacancy Refund over time to 0%. Vacancy in our town centres needs to be tackled aggressively.

• Work with central government to refine the full range of revenue raising measures available to councils to ensure businesses can thrive in town centres. We will be pragmatic in dealing with businesses that are still suffering from the effects of the

pandemic on their sales, including consideration of support grants for smaller ratepayers.

• Fund Business Area Support Grants to enable business associations in towns and villages to run Shop Local promotions and seasonal events.

• Advocate for a mechanism for green rates rebates for businesses that can demonstrate some actions towards mitigating climate change.

7. COMMUNITY

7.1. Policing and Community Safety

The work of the Gardaí is fundamental to creating safe and secure communities. As part of Government, we have overseen a huge investment in policing. In particular, there has been a greater focus on Community Policing.

We have also prioritised combating violence against women. We have set up Cuan, the new domestic, sexual and gender based violence agency, to drive a coherent national response. This will help us to achieve our goal

of providing a dedicated Women’s Refuge in every county for victims and families experiencing domestic violence.

We propose to:

• Put more Gardaí on the street - we will use existing forums at local authority level to allow communities to input into local policing strategies.

• In the medium term, invest in the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and fight the causes of crime, by providing more space for young people and improving youth work supports.

• Support more investment and the rapid rollout of Community Policing Teams throughout the country.

• Push for An Garda Síochána to publish accurate and open data on crime in our communities. We also want to see greater diversity within An Garda Síochána, and strengthened oversight structures.

• Give every community access to a Local Policing Forum if sufficient demand exists.

• Support the establishment in every county of a dedicated Women’s Refuge for victims and families experiencing domestic violence.

• Plan our towns and cities to be ‘safer by design’, so that our public spaces discourage and prevent crime. This can be done with better lighting, fewer narrow passageways, and passive surveillance.

• We will ensure that dog pounds contracted by councils operate in a humane way and promote better animal welfare through every effort of the local authorities.

7.2. Thriving Towns and Villages

We will deliver renewed vibrancy in our towns and villages, while protecting our built heritage. We have continued to fund the maintenance and restoration of heritage buildings and protected structures.

We propose to:

• Undertake a review of street clutter in all towns and cities and remove unused or obsolete street furniture to improve accessibility. These useless items should be replaced with minimum numbers of new benches and seating as places to rest for older persons and people with mobility impairment.

• Increase the number of public toilets.

• Identify long-term vacant commercial units and consider their transition to potential community infrastructure.

Schemes, we will complete long-awaited improvements to our towns and villages and provide communities with the infrastructure they need.

• Push for a Vacant Homes Officer, Heritage Officer, County Architect, Cycling Officer and Landscape Architect for every local authority.

• Support TidyTowns groups and work with them to increase the positive impact on biodiversity and climate that communities can make.

• Fund shopfront improvement schemes to assist small businesses in

to promote a more appealing townscape.

• Seek to control the over-proliferation of hotels in certain areas of our cities, especially where it is damaging the cultural character of the community.

• Build more Mens’ Sheds.

The movement has been a fantastic addition to the quality of life of so many men in Ireland, and Green councillors have supported its growth with enthusiasm. We will continue to seek all opportunities to expand its scope with provision of land and financial and other supports.

7.3. Banking and Post Offices

Lively villages need to have banking and postal services available to all. We must retain access to the bank and cash services in our local areas. In Government, we have provided funding of €30 million over three years to support our Post Offices, to ensure that the network of 900 offices remains sustainable into the future.

We propose to:

• Prioritise funding and support for retention of existing Post Offices and reopening of them in areas where they have been closed and no other financial outlet is operating.

• Push for the Green Party’s

Public Banking proposal which would go even further, and make post offices an integral part of a publicly-owned bank, tasked with investing locally in rural communities and businesses.

• Maintain access to cash in the community to prevent financial exclusion.

7.4 Integration

Migrants are hugely enriching to our society. We welcome those fleeing wars and crises abroad seeking refuge in Ireland, in a spirit of humanity and compassion that we know is shared by the majority of Irish people, in light of our own historical experience.

We support the principle of ‘integration from day one’ with the overarching aim of empowering people to live independently in the community. We will encourage new arrivals to become involved in community groups and sports clubs. We want our councils to become leaders in welcoming and integrating new arrivals in Ireland.

We propose to:

• Ensure that all Local Authority Integration Teams (LAITs) are fully staffed and can help to welcome new arrivals into our communities, including extra resourcing in counties with large numbers of Ukrainians and International Protection applicants.

• Repurpose the Community Response Fora, which have been so successful in responding to COVID and in welcoming Ukrainian refugees, to become local integration forums.

• Support Local Development Companies and community workers who have played a crucial role in creating inclusive communities. They need increased funding and better coordination between parties involved in integration.

• Ensure that communities are supported in welcoming migrants through extra resourcing, especially with healthcare professionals and schools. We want to bring in more structured and cohesive funding streams for integration, so that community groups can access these funds more easily and focus on the important work they are doing.

• Ensure that each local authority has a local migrant integration strategy.

• We will use our council buildings to celebrate our diversity, including World Refugee Day.

8. CULTURE

8.1. Arts, Culture, Media and the Gaeltacht

More than ever, the last few years have taught us the crucial importance of the arts, culture and language in our communities. We want to support and foster creativity, with councils at the forefront, through the use of national funding and of council facilities. We will also ensure that local councils are a catalyst for the spread and use of the Irish language.

We propose to:

• Support and enhance our creative culture by building studios, practice spaces and workspaces for the creative community,

to accommodate both daytime and night-time cultural and creative activities, help support our communities, artists and nighttime economy. We will work to improve

accessibility to cultural venues for people of all abilities.

• Incorporate requirements for new developments to include provision of artistic spaces and cultural venues in county/city development plans and local area plans. We will mandate a minimum of 5% creative or cultural space in large developments.

• Continue the ‘Per Cent for Art’ initiative in all local authorities, whereby 1% of the cost of all public projects is put towards commissioning public art works. We will commission more urban art, murals, and painted utility boxes, in collaboration with local artists.

• We will appoint Night Mayors for our cities to protect and enhance our nighttime economy. We want to build on the existing pilot scheme to all local authorities and to promote a diverse nighttime culture

throughout the country while supporting venues at risk of closure.

• Implement the Local Authority Creative Ireland Culture and Creativity Strategies in every local authority.

• Strongly support our public libraries, working with them to develop initiatives to combat loneliness. We will work with schools to guarantee that every child receives a library card when they start primary school, to instil a lifelong love of reading. We will also expand ‘Libraries of Things’ and ‘Toy Libraries’ in council libraries and work with local Gardaí to ensure their users and staff are protected from disruption.

• Continue to support and protect local media, and build on the funding we have already put in place for stronger reporting on local democracy.

• Develop local plans in each county to grow and enhance the use of the Irish language. We will ensure that local development plans include access to Irish language services in line with the Official Languages Act. We will ensure an expansion of the Irish language shopfronts scheme.

• We will support and facilitate the development of affordable housing on public land in the Gaeltacht, subject to a language condition, so

that Irish speakers can remain in, or return to live in the Gaeltacht, to ensure the continued vibrance of the Irish-language communities there.

• Develop more play and hang out spaces for teenagers, who are often underserved. We will directly ask teenagers and follow the example of the ‘Make Space for Girls’ campaign to create play spaces that will be sheltered, safe and enjoyable.

8.2. Sport and Parks

We propose to:

• Develop sporting infrastructure that is accessible for all ensuring that gender, ethnicity and culture are not barriers to involvement, and work to improve access to local sporting infrastructure for those with disabilities via the Changing Places and other schemes.

• Provide more free gym exercise equipment in parks, as well as depositbased sports equipment in parks.

• Support sports clubs and community groups to apply for funding under the Sports Capital Programme to deliver civic sports facilities, prioritising facilities that are shared by several clubs and groups. We will carry out reviews

to find out how access to sports facilities can be improved for people of all ages.

• Establish a Playgrounds Building Fund, as well as funding skate parks, pump tracks and teenagefocused amenities.

• Enhance and expand the Slí na Sláinte routes, and improve access to walking trails.

• Support the development of lidos and outdoor swimming facilities.

• Continue to support female participation in sports, as well as that of other groups less likely to be involved. We will introduce cycling training for people with disabilities, older people, and children.

8.3. Tourism

We have an opportunity to develop tourism that is sustainable both for the planet and for local communities. By funding greenways, walking trails, and outdoor amenities on bogs, we are creating winwin-win situations for regional development, local towns and a Just Transition.

Developing existing and new national parks will boost tourism, support local economies and revitalise nature. In 2023, there were 70 greenway projects and by next year we will have increased the number of walking trails from 80 to 150 in just five years.

We propose to:

• Develop greenways and blueways nationally and expand the network of walking trails. We will ensure that local communities and farmers are at the centre of the decision-making process in the development of greenway routes.

• Develop the national cycling network to

tourism.

• Recognise and support the role of tourism in every county as a part of a just transition for rural communities.

• Ensure that short-term lets are kept at a sustainable level and that planning requirements are enforced by local authorities.

• Advocate for local tourism strategies with a focus on increasing sustainable domestic tourism. We will support the development of low-impact nature tourism.

• Encourage the development of ecocampsites and eco-cabins.

9. PUBLIC SERVICES

9.1. Childcare and Education

Before the last local elections, we committed to helping families to deal with childcare.

Over the past two Budgets, we have reduced childcare fees by 25% (with another 25% cut coming this year), extended breastfeeding breaks and medical leave for parents, and provided additional parents’ leave and adoptive leave for same sex couples. In schools, we have ensured that every child in a DEIS school gets a hot meal every day. We want to continue this focus on equality and access for all at the local government level.

We propose to:

• Actively seek and prioritise community-based, nonprofit childcare providers for all council-owned or council-developed childcare facilities.

• Continue to invest in the quality of childcare and ensure that every childcare worker gets paid properly in line with their substantial qualifications

and invaluable work.

lands for outdoor learning opportunities, or ‘Forest Schools’ programmes.

• Mandate minimum levels of childcare facilities to be provided based on local need and new housing developments.

• Undertake a review in each local authority to ensure that all childcare premises have the appropriate space and services and meet all fire safety and air quality requirements.

• Provide grant schemes to facilitate the adaptation of suitably located community, youth and sports facilities to operate as after-school service providers which could also be used by community groups operating cooperative childcare.

• Ensure that every child in every primary school gets a hot meal every day, as locally sourced and organic as possible. We will introduce biodiversity grants for schools to promote food growing, as well as providing council

• We will prioritise investing in the Safe Routes to School programme and expand it to all schools, to promote safe walking, cycling and scooting for children and their parents. We will mandate 30km (or less) speed limits outside all schools across the country, and aim for every school to have a footpath leading to its nearest village.

• In addition to existing solar panel grants, we will provide monitoring mechanisms for schools to track energy saved.

• Protect libraries and schools from verbal abuse and aggressive demonstration. We will expand and promote the Yellow and Purple flag systems for inclusivity.

• Explore opportunities to open up university campuses to better

integrate their public spaces into the community. We will provide for comprehensive access and parking strategies at local authority level.

• Encourage walking to schools by zoning sufficient land in appropriate distance from new housing developments rather than in out-of-town locations.

9.2. Health and Disability

The next few years will see a significant reorganisation of our health service to regionally delivered services and Community Healthcare Organisations. As a result, local leadership is more important than ever.

We propose to:

• Ensure that the new Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) are engaged with the needs of local communities and listen to the needs of service users on the ground. We will continue to invest in primary care centres, strengthening community-based healthcare.

• Advocate for access to GPs across all areas so that no area, whether rural or urban, is left without access to a general practice doctor.

• Continue to fight for addiction services to be locally available and adequately funded

through local primary care networks.

• Mandate a minimum number of breastfeeding spaces in our County/City Development Plans as well as breastfeeding benches.

• Provide free period products in public buildings.

• Provide all local areas with accessible mental health supports through primary care facilities. We will continue to advocate for local access to outpatient and assisted living supports and trauma informed services.

• Push for councils to adopt well-being economy indicators on health,

nature, education, communities and future generations.

• Continue to advocate for more accessibility across council services so that everyone can engage with local democracy and have their voice heard.

• Ensure both our built environment and public transport networks are fully accessible to people with disabilities and developed in line with the United Nations Convention on the Right of Persons With Disabilities. We will continue to work for a Universal Design approach to our streets and neighbourhoods and engage with public transport bodies to ensure buses, trains and all other modes are available to all.

• Push for local councils to increase the provision of social housing completed

to Universal Design standards as a significant percentage of all housing investment.

• Push for a dedicated Disability Officer to be appointed in every local authority, to ensure the most inclusive options are implemented in our communities. We will adhere to the Public Sector Duty to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect the human rights of public sector staff and service users. We will introduce autism-friendly initiatives. We will roll out more inclusive seating as well as dedicated parking spaces for those with hidden disabilities.

• Ensure that people with disabilities can quickly secure housing adaptation grants.

• Prepare local strategies to combat loneliness.

10. REFORM

Councils are the closest layer of government to the people. However, people often feel unheard by their local authorities, which have been prevented from providing a fast, innovative and transparent service to communities.

We want to change local government so that it becomes truly representative of the will of people living locally.

We want to empower people across the country to directly choose their mayor and hold that person accountable for the development of their cities and towns. We favour the gradual delegation of powers, so that decisions are made at the most local level possible.

We propose to:

• Ensure transparency in how the council and councillors operate. We will ensure all local authority meetings are livestreamed and votes are recorded and easily available. We will publish information on how Local Property Tax, parking charges and development contributions are being spent.

• Push for real public consultation beyond the current online surveys. Outcomes from public consultations must be considered and reasons provided back to citizens for reaching the final decision.

• Help councillors to be more effective. Ireland has the lowest ratio of councillors to citizens in the EU. We want to provide a better service to constituents and recognise councillors’ workloads through increased secretarial supports. We want to provide more training to

councillors so that they are equipped to make big decisions, and in anticipation of devolving more powers to local government in the areas of policing, local economic development, arts, education, tourism and culture.

• Restore town and borough councils for effectiveness, subsidiarity, urban representation and better governance. All towns and cities above 30,000 population should have a choice as to whether they want a Directly Elected Mayor.

• Ensure that there is greater diversity and gender balance at all levels of Irish politics. We will make being a councillor more accessible and family-friendly, especially through the use of hybrid meetings. We will strive to make council committees gender balanced.

• Develop small “general construction” teams of directly employed council staff, who can perform small repairs and works without going through expensive and slow procurement processes. We want councils to take on apprentices, especially in areas of skills shortages such as construction and retrofitting, which will add capacity and speed up processes.

• Restructure local authorities so that there are general Council Enforcement Officers who actively patrol communities, merging the

roles of the Dog Warden, Litter Warden and Traffic Warden.

• Work with council officials to undertake an audit of procured services to assess whether directly providing these services would be more cost-effective.

• Allocate public service resources fairly. Counties with high population growth must not get left behind in terms of public sector staff and fire services.

• Limit election postering and introduce Europeanstyle designated postering spaces. National law needs to change to recognise the changing nature of elections in an internet age. Designated areas will retain the public visibility of postering without the public resistance and plastic wastage.

Develop innovations to evolve and strengthen our democracy with citizens, such as:

• Local citizens’ assemblies;

• ‘Beta projects’ in councils, so that people can suggest policy ideas for local problems for their council to trial and scale if successful;

• A greater voice for younger people, whose futures will depend on the decisions we make

now. We will promote and enhance our Comhairle na nÓg. In the medium-term, we propose to lower the voting age to 16;

• Local participative budgeting, so that residents can set the priorities of the community;

• Standardised ‘Report It’ applications across local authorities, so that citizens can easily notify councils of issues.
",2024,"Local","Green Party","Green Party_2024_Local"
"Local 2024: PBP","INTRODUCTION: WE NEED RADICAL CHANGE

People Before Profit is an eco-socialist 32 county party. We want to truly transform Irish society and build a 32-county socialist republic that genuinely puts people before profit.

At the next general election we need to elect a Left Government that will build affordable houses, bring vacant homes back into use and make public housing available to all. It will control and reduce rents and ban vulture funds. It will tax the rich to fund quality health and education services for all, nationalise the energy system to drive a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy and provide free and frequent public transport countrywide, to cut living costs and reduce our carbon emissions.

The first step in doing so will be to get rid of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

Many councils across the country are dominated by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They have failed to deliver on housing and worsened public services. A deliberate game of pass the parcel is set up so that the national government run by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael blame local councils for lack of social housing. These in turn blame the government. Meanwhile thousands languish on the housing list for years.

We should use the local elections to pay back Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens for all of their policies since they got back into power. They lifted the Eviction Ban which saw homelessness skyrocket while at the same they have given tax breaks to big landlords. Their housing plans have failed to provide people with homes but have been very successful in enriching landlords and developers. .

We need to use the local elections to deliver a clear message to the establishment parties. We need to vote for radical change. People Before Profit is the only party that will not enter coalition with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. At local councils we will not vote for Mayors from the establishment parties. We will not engage in horse trading for positions with extra pay.

We need to elect left councils which put the needs of people over the needs of big business, and are willing to challenge whoever is in government on issues like housing and funding for local services. Councils that will put people’s needs first and stand up

to the government. A left council that will fight central government for extra central funding to build homes and provide services. We will only vote for budgets that provide better services but do not impose extra household property taxes. If the government does not accept such budgets or threatens to disband councils – as they have done in the past - we shall mobilise people power to oppose them.

If Elected People Before Profit Councillors Pledge to:

• Vote against the election of Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil Mayors.

• Work to clear the housing lists and build social housing. Stop developers building up land banks to create dearer homes. Impose stiff charges on vacant homes and building land. End the scandal of homelessness.

• Demand greater investment in housing, retrofitting and maintenance: People Before Profit wants a State Construction Company to work with councils to build tens of thousands of new houses and retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes.

• Fight for more council staff so that we have decent local services.

• Demand an end to charges for waste collection: Bring waste collection back into public ownership.

• Vote against cuts to services. Impose a tourist tax to help fund better services. Increase the rates on big multi-nationals.

• Vote against increased taxes and charges for the public: abolish the Property Tax.

• Oppose privatisation. No unnecessary tenders for private companies, especially those that do not give union rights.

• Stand up to racism and the scapegoating of refugees.

• Demand a greater say for you in what happens in your community.

• Provide a voice for those fighting for better services: we will organise and support campaigns for better services.

• Treat council tenants with respect. We want an independent appeal board to hear about council neglect on repairs. No council homes to be left vacant for more than a month.

• Campaign to make local Councils apartheid free zones by breaking any diplomatic ties with Israel, rejecting any investment or procurement relationship that involves companies who help Israel to violate Palestinian rights.

WHAT’S WRONG WITH OUR COUNCILS?

Our councils are developer led and controlled by the council bureaucracy. They are also underfunded.

1. For too long Councils have been dependent on developers and the private sector to deliver services.

HOUSING

Instead of building houses directly, councils have voted to give land away to developers. The developers will then build houses and give a small number of these to the council while the rest of them are sold at sky-high prices, meaning local people are priced out. This model has failed for people but worked for developers.

Of the 7,500 social homes built in 2022, 70% were purchased from the private sector. The number of local authority builds on state land was only 1,689, with the four Dublin councils building just 476. Compare that with 1975 when councils built 9000 houses.

The failure to build social and affordable houses has huge social and economic costs.

• Almost 58,000 are on waiting lists, with nearly a quarter being on the list for over 7 years.

• Another 68,000 households are on Housing Assistance Payments (HAP).

• Nearly 14,000 people are homeless, over 4,000 of these are children.

• The state hands over nearly €1 billion a year to landlords to subsidise rents.

• Average rents are through the roof being over €1,800 and €2,300 in Dublin

• Nearly two thirds of 20 to 24 year olds and a third of 25-29 year olds live with their parents.

WASTE COLLECTION

Bin collections have been privatised and are now run by private companies. Privatisation has brought increased charges, a decline in recycling and an increase in dumping. Ireland is unlikely to reach EU targets for recycling for 2025. Municipal waste recycling rate was 41% in 2020, the same as 2016, however it must reach 55% by 2025.

Charges can be as high as €360 a year. Panda, one of the biggest waste collection

companies, recently announced price increases of up to 8%. Businessman Eamon Waters recently sold the company that owns Panda to Macquarie, an Australian financial services giant. He was reported to have received a windfall of €367m from the €1bn sale. Huge profits are being made at the public’s expense.

Conditions of employment for bin workers are much worse than they were when waste collection was done by council workers.

2. Overly centralised and little democracy.

Our councils have too little power and are controlled by full time bureaucrats appointed by the government. In Dublin, for example, the vast majority of councillors voted against an incineration plant but the Chief Executive just imposed it on the city.

The strong position of the chief executive limits the role of the elected representatives. For example, the Chief Executive is responsible for writing the annual Budget with councillors being left with limited options to amend it. This gives a semblance of democracy but the reality is that unelected management make the majority of decisions.

The lack of democracy at local level is made worse by the powers of the Minister for Housing and Local Government to overturn democratic decisions of councils. In 2022, the Minister overturned a decision of South Dublin Council to ban the construction of data centres in South Dublin. The ban was proposed by People Before Profit Councillor Madeleine Johansson.

In Ireland a number of functions have been lost to central government (for example water) or to new quangos including higher education grants (to SUSI), driving licences (to NDRL) and public transport (to NTA). This has not necessarily improved the services. In the case of driving licences, both fees and administrative processing time increased because of centralisation.

Compared to other countries, local authorities have little autonomy or control. A small fraction of government spending (8%) goes through Local Authorities. On average it’s over 20% across the EU. Ireland ranks third worst for local democracy in Europe, after Moldova and Hungary.

Research shows that locating services in local government brings down costs and charges, improves conditions for workers and boosts service quality.

3. Not Enough Staff.

The government has starved local authorities of funds. This has led to cuts in staff. As can be seen below, employment levels were cut by 24% between 2008 and 2018. While some recovery has taken place, employment levels in 2022 were 9% lower than in 2008. The number employed in 2022 was lower than in 1980 despite huge population increases of almost 50% since 1980.

YEAR

Number of Local Authority Workers

1980

32,505

2008

35,007

2018

28,224

2022

31,735

Local authorities lack the staff and resources to deliver high quality services to the public. In County Galway staff numbers are 24% below what they were in 2008, while across the four Dublin authorities the fall is 14%.

No wonder council tenants frequently complain about serious issues with housing maintenance and a slow response from the council. In October 2017, the European Committee of Social Rights ruled that Ireland had failed to take sufficient and timely measures to ensure the right to housing of an adequate standard for many families living in local authority housing across the country. The Community Action Network took the case on behalf of Local Authority tenants.

Specifically, the Committee found that Ireland was in violation of the right of the family to social, legal and economic protection, including the provision of family housing. Despite this ruling tenants continue to live in substandard accommodation and are forced to fight for adequate maintenance.

4. Funding.

Austerity impacted local government finances. In 2008 central government provided €2.3b to councils. This figure fell to €1.5 b in 2018 and only recovered in recent years being €2.7b in 2023. The largest impact was felt in housing where funding fell by 88% between 2008 and 2014 leading to a drop of 91% in housing output.

Some of the gap in funding was filled by the imposition of the Local Property Tax in 2013. This now provides councils with 7% of their income and raised €426m in 2023. This is an unfair tax on many people’s family home, often before they even own them.

Councils are very dependent on central government for financing with 42% of their combined funding coming from central Government through different grants and subsidies. But there are strings attached as parcels of funds are directed to specific obligations which means that if money is saved under one heading, it doesn’t necessarily follow that it can be spent on another priority where extra funding is required.

The rest of the finance comes from Commercial Rates (27%) and Income from Local Goods/Services (24%) including rents, waste and parking charges. We believe there is considerable scope to raise additional funding from levying higher rates on large multinationals. We also want a tourist tax to help fund the services. In general, People Before Profit believes that the wealthy and large corporations should pay more.

WHAT WOULD WE DO?

People Before Profit councillors will argue for measures that put the needs of ordinary people before the needs of big business. We will challenge whoever is in government on issues like housing and funding for local services. We want Left Councils that will argue for and carry out the following measures.

A State Construction Company: Housing for All

The housing crisis is the result of profiteering by landlords, vulture funds, builders, banks and developers. It’s not the fault of immigrants and refugees. The supply of social and affordable housing needs to be ramped up to drive down prices and rents. People Before Profit wants to widen access to social housing for all and create a state construction company that will work with councils to ramp up house building, retrofit homes and ensure houses are maintained to a high standard. We will stop developers hoarding land banks to drive up the price of houses.

Build Houses on Public Land

Councils are sitting on land that could build over 20,000 homes. A study by the Land Development Agency in 2023 shows that there is currently publicly-owned land available to build almost 67,000 homes. As well as councils, this land belongs to government agencies and semi-state companies across 10 cities and regional towns.

A state building company would work with councils to get these houses built now.

Bring Vacant Houses Back Into Use

The quickest way to bring new homes into the housing system is to make available those that already exist. According to Census 2022 there are over 166,000 empty homes in the state excluding holiday homes. 65,000 of these were also vacant in 2016 and over 40,000 have been vacant since at least 2011. Vacant and derelict properties should be compulsory purchased.

In 2023 PBP councillor Madeleine Johansson put a motion to South Dublin County Council to Compulsory Purchase (CPO) derelict sites in the county. Her proposal aimed to CPO ten residential properties listed as derelict in the county, providing much-needed homes. Councillors of the establishment parties Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Green Party and Labour Party all voted against it.

People Before Profit propose the introduction of substantial “use it or lose it” taxes on vacant and derelict buildings and sites.

Ramp Up Investment in Maintenance and Retrofitting

Councils need to ramp up retrofitting of Council houses to reduce emissions and cut energy costs for tenants. At the current rate even the inadequate government targets to retrofit a third of council homes by 2030 will not be met. We need to retrofit 100% of council homes that need it to meet our climate targets.

We also need action to address the poor condition of some council housing. Financial allocations for retrofitting and maintenance need to increase. We will fight for increased recruitment of maintenance staff and an end to outsourcing of maintenance work to private contractors. Council tenants should be able to go to an independent board with complaints about council maintenance.

Recruit Building Workers

Councils need to be re-skilled to play an active role in building homes and maintaining them. The council should launch a new apprenticeship programme for young people, and offer higher pay and conditions to attract workers from the private sector.

Bring Services back under Council Control

Privatisation has been a disaster for most services. The councils should bring services back under public ownership starting with the bin service. Waste collection should be free and provision for recycling needs to be expanded.

We support the keeping of water services under local control. A referendum should be held to protect the right to, and public ownership of, water.

Create Living Environmentally Friendly Communities for All: Bring in Free and Frequent Public Transport

We need more investment to create liveable communities where people can easily walk or cycle to shops, schools and other local facilities. People Before Profit has campaigned for Free and Frequent Public Transport to reduce car use and emissions.

We need more investment in active travel, making it easier for people to walk or cycle, with more and better pedestrian crossings.

We want more investment in parks and public amenities with better lighting and safer design of public spaces including parks and public transport stops.

We should provide new facilities and want to see more teen spaces and youth clubs, areas of special conservation and playgrounds, community centres, free community childcare, mother and baby groups and breastfeeding support.

Our cities, towns, public transport and buildings should be accessible for all. All housing developments that the state constructs should be designed for accessibility and be fully disability proofed so all people with disabilities can live independently. We need to invest in our public transport system so our buses can accommodate more than one wheelchair user at a time.

Ban Data Centres

Dublin is the European Capital of data centres with 77 out of the 82 in Ireland. They create very few jobs and are environmentally destructive. By 2030 they could be using 30% of our electricity, making it hard to reach renewable energy targets and increasing the risk of power cuts.

People Before Profit has campaigned to ban data centres.

Who Lives Here Belongs Here: Migrants Are Welcome Here

We are anti-racist champions and proponents of diversity. Migrants make a huge contribution to Irish society and without them our hospitals would not function and our buses would not run. Many vital care services would collapse without the contributions of migrants. Councils should welcome people from all communities and backgrounds and do more to ensure our towns and cities are accommodating and accessible.

We will welcome migrants and refugees and stand against racism wherever it rears its ugly head. We will campaign to:

1. Provide a welcoming environment for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including investment in more local services to help all newcomers in our local communities.

2. Support the right to remain for asylum seekers, migrants and refugees, and oppose direct provision. Refugees should have the right to work and contribute their skills to society.

Make the Corporations Pay for Local Services: Abolish the Local Property Tax

People Before Profit councillors will support the abolition of the LPT and have opposed all attempts to increase it.Local government should be able to fund itself properly through increased revenue and funding powers.

While central government should increase funding, for example to replace revenue from abolition of the LPT, councils should be able to levy increased rates on large companies who benefit from the services.

While council can only levy one level of rates we believe that increasing rates could be combined with a rebate scheme to protect smaller businesses from large rates increases. This has been implemented in Limerick City and County Council since 2014. People Before Profit councillors in South Dublin have consistently proposed this but it has been voted down by all mainstream parties including Sinn Fein.

Workers’ Rights

Council workers provide a crucial public service. They keep our communities clean and safe, run our community centres, parks and various other services. But they are overworked, underpaid, and deserve much better especially during this cost-of-living crisis.

People Before Profit supports trade union demands for pay increases that match inflation and for a Living Wage.

We would work to ensure councils reduce agency employment. We will champion the expansion of council employment as well as better terms and conditions for staff, including increased trade union rights. All council contracts should stipulate that workers’ trade

union rights are protected.

Greater Democracy

Councils should be run in the interest of the people. Full time Executive Officers should work under the direction of elected councillors. They should be removed if they refuse to implement decisions made by elected councillors. If they try to undermine the decisions of those who are elected, we will vote to remove them.

Councillors should be accountable to the people. They should hold regular forums in the community to give local people a say. Councillors should be subject to a right of recall and removal if they breach election promises and betray commitments given to the people who elect them.

A voice for Palestine – make Councils Apartheid Free Zones

People Before Profit stands behind the people of Palestine in the struggle against apartheid and settler colonialism. The Israeli state is guilty of genocide and war crimes. Since October 2023 Israel has murdered over 35,000 people, many thousands more injured and traumatised, while some 2 million people in Gaza face starvation.

Palestine is the litmus test of our humanity and the political establishment have failed that test. The Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government have refused to expel the Israeli Ambassador, while Irish political parties North and South are content to wine and dine Joe Biden in the White House, as he funds and arms Israeli apartheid. The ongoing use of Shannon airport for the US military is a flagrant breach of Ireland’s neutrality and to the cause of Palestine solidarity.

If elected, our councillors would be champions for Palestine solidarity and will fight to implement a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) policy at local government level. We wish to make local Councils apartheid free zones by breaking any diplomatic ties with Israel, rejecting any investment or procurement relationship that involves companies who help Israel to violate Palestinian rights, and striving to ensure local councils reflect the mass public support for Palestinian rights.

A vote for a People Before Profit candidate is a vote for someone who will:

1. Organise Palestine solidarity initiatives in their community and inside the Council chamber.

2. Fight to make local Councils apartheid free zones.

3. Challenge any investment or procurement arrangement that is complicit in apartheid Israel.

4. Support the Palestine solidarity movement in its demand for a ceasefire and a dismantling of apartheid structures.

5. Propose that local Councils adopt a firm position to expel the Israeli ambassador and to immediately close Shannon airport to the US military.

An Ghaeilge

Tacaíonn an Pobal Seachas Brabús leis na geallúintí atá á long ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, ina measc:

People Before Profit supports the commitments being sought by the Irish language and Gaeltacht community. These include:

1. Go bhforbrófar polasaí tithíochta Gaeltachta in aon údarás áitiúil le ceantar Gaeltachta faoina chúram.

The development of a Gaeltacht housing policy in any local authority with a Gaeltacht area under their remit.

2. Go mbunófar Rannóg na Gaeilge san údarás áitiúil le beirt lánaimseartha ar a laghad ag feidhmiú ann.

The development of a Gaeltacht housing policy in any local authority with a Gaeltacht area under their remit.

3. Go bhforbrófar Straitéis don Ghaeilge san údarás áitiúil agus í a fheidhmiú.

The development and implementation of a Strategy for the Irish Language in the local authority.

4. Go mbunófar Coiste Gaeilge mar chuid de struchtúr an údaráis áitiúil.

The establishment of an Irish Language Committee as an integral part of the structure of the local authority.

5. Go gcuirfear tacaíocht ar fáil chun an Ghaeilge sa phobal a threisiú.

The provision of supports to strengthen the Irish language in the community.

People Before Profit Pledges to stand with those Fighting for Improved Services

People Before Profit believes that real change comes for people organising to change their communities and society more generally. Our councillors have stood with those who fight injustice and for better services. We played a central role in the campaign to stop Water Charges.

We have campaigned to ban data centres, for public housing and the compulsory purchase of vacant homes. We want to see domestic violence refuges in every county. Nine counties, including Carlow, are without a refuge. Our councillor in Carlow, Adrienne Wallace, has used her position to fight for a refuge.

In Tallaght Central, People Before Profit successfully organised residents to campaign for investment in Watergate Park, with extra lighting installed and extra picnic benches and a teen space on the way. A similar campaign in Tallaght South has resulted in a commitment to refurbish the play space in Kiltalown Park.

In Dun Laoghaire we led the campaign to Save the Seafront. Throughout Dublin we have fought for better bus services and against cuts to services resulting from the implementation of Bus Connects.

We give a pledge to stand with those who want to fight for better communities.

People Before Profit wants to see the election of a Left Government at the next election which would:

1. Take on the speculators and solve the housing crisis by ending reliance on the ‘market’. We would create a state construction company tasked with clearing the housing lists within five years by doubling current housing targets. We would enforce building standards and compensate all those affected by building failures.

2. Take on the landlords and the rip-off of renters. We would ban vulture and cuckoo funds, bring in rent controls to reduce rents and provide security of tenure for all tenants by banning economic evictions.

3. Tax the rich to fund quality public services. We need a National Health Service. We need to make education and childcare free at point of access.

4. End Ireland’s corporate tax haven status. We would close the tax loopholes, increase the corporation tax rate to 20% and introduce a millionaire’s tax on net assets exceeding €1 million.

5. End the scandal of low pay and poverty. We would increase the minimum wage to €15 an hour to provide a living wage for the lowest paid and raise wages for all. We would end poverty rates for pensions and social welfare and provide a living income to carers.

6. Oppose all forms of racism, discrimination and oppression: We would end Direct Provision and allow asylum seekers to work, access housing and social protection payments.

7. Separate Church and State. We would bring church controlled hospitals and schools into public ownership and democratic control, and prepare a new secular constitution which puts people’s rights first.

8. Replace imperialist-driven foreign policy, with one based on solidarity. We would end the use of Shannon airport and Irish airspace by the US military, withdraw from all military adventures, support the struggle for Palestinian liberation and oppose all steps to bring us closer to NATO or create a European army.

9. Set a target for a just transition to a zero carbon and ecologically sustainable economy by 2030. We would nationalise the energy system to enable a rapid transition to 100% renewable, low-cost electricity. Introduce free and frequent public transport and take the big polluting companies into public ownership to enable the necessary rapid transformation of the economy. We would nationalise the banks with publicly controlled credit to aid a just transition.

"Local 2024: Sinn Fein","Introduction

This year’s local and European Elections are taking place at a time when Ireland is facing many challenges – an ongoing housing crisis, a health service that is at breaking point and a cost-of-living crisis. These elections are an opportunity for people to have their say on the change they want to see.

We have a government that is out of touch, that doesn’t understand the challenges workers and families are facing, doesn’t have the ideas or the capacity to fix them, and doesn’t give our local Councils the resources and the funds to deliver for communities.

Change starts in your local community, with your local Sinn Féin councillor working hard for you to make sure your Council works better for you. Better delivery of social and affordable housing. Better delivery of local services and amenities. Better maintenance of our roads and making our streets safer.

Local Councils will be crucial to the delivering affordable homes for workers and families under a Sinn Féin led government. That is why a vote for Sinn Féin in the local elections on 7th June is a vote to start fixing the housing crisis.

Sinn Féin’s commitment to you is that we will make sure your voice in heard at local level. Politics works best when decisions are taken closest to those impacted and when the views of communities is heard.

Sinn Féin councillors will work hard for you. We will make it our business to ensure that your Council delivers for you.

Our priorities include:

– Putting the delivery of social and affordable housing back at the top of the Council agenda.

– Making your Council work better for you; consulting, listening, and delivering for the community.

– Tackling red tape and delays at local authority level, particularly in relation to planning and the delivery of housing and infrastructure.

– Getting local Councils back doing the things they once did well including the maintenance of roads, delivering local services - including waste services, cleaning our streets, and delivering and maintaining homes for which they are responsible.

– Supporting communities working hard to improve their local areas by investing in public spaces, leisure and sports facilities, transport infrastructure and the local environment.

Building Public Housing on Public Land

After 13 years of Fine Gael in Government, home ownership has collapsed. Workers and families can’t afford to buy and they can’t afford to rent.

Instead of building homes Fine Gael have spent almost €10billion of taxpayers money on subsidies to landlords (HAP/RAS/Rent Supplement/Long Term Leasing).

Almost 140,000 households are in need of social housing many waiting more than 10 years for a home. Vulture funds are still being allowed to buy up family homes.

The average house price is now €330,000 rising to €440,000 in Dublin – more than three times the maximum mortgage that most young people can get.

Some local authorities are leaving homes empty for over 22 months between tenants with homes left boarded up .

Local authorities are one of the biggest employers across the state but the majority have taken on no craft apprentices in 2023, Dublin City which the biggest local authority only took on 37 apprentices.

There are 166,752 vacant homes. In 2022 less than €1million was collected in the Derelict Sites Levy with eighteen local authorities collecting nothing.

Homelessness has reached levels never thought imaginable with almost 14,000 people including over 4,000 children officially homeless.

There are ongoing difficulties faced by people in rural Ireland when trying to obtain planning permission for a single house, often on family land.

There are people, living in Council homes and private rentals, who are forced to live in substandard conditions - in damp, mouldy or unmaintained homes.

Sinn Féin are the only party with a plan to deliver the biggest house building programme in the history of the State. We will deliver affordable homes through local Councils and Approved Housing Bodies at prices people can genuinely afford, ensuring their delivery in the main, through the use of public land. This is alongside the delivery of social homes and delivery of a wider range of homes by the private sector at all sorts of price points. Capacity, pace, and affordability are all key but also core is political prioritisation. Local authorities have a vital role to play in our planning system and need to be properly resourced.

A Sinn Féin government would also put one month’s rent back into every private renters pocket and ban rent increases for three years.

Local Councils will be crucial to the delivery of affordable homes for ordinary workers and families under a Sinn Féin led government.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Delivering the biggest public housing programme in the history of the State to meet social and affordable housing need.

– Delivering affordable homes on an unprecedented scale that teachers, nurses, factory and retail workers can actually afford to buy or rent.

– Stopping vulture funds buying up family homes and student housing.

– Development Plans are robust in supporting local authorities to work to end the housing crisis.

– Speed up the construction of homes by reducing bureaucracy and red tape which is delaying the delivery of housing; Working with homeless service providers to end long-term homelessness.

– Ensuring local development plans support the survival of rural communities; Use compulsory purchase, where practical, and return to use derelict and vacant properties.

– Ensuring greater collection of the Derelict Sites Levy and speed up the return of vacant Council homes.

– Delivering increased housing maintenance budgets and working towards every local authority producing a five-year rolling preventative maintenance plan.

– Ensure we have the workers to build and maintain homes by creating more places for construction related apprenticeships.

– Including the needs of local Gaeltacht and Irish speaking communities at the heart of City/County Development Plans, including their social and affordable housing needs, and in the case of local authorities serving Gaeltacht areas, implementing measures including language impact assessments, language conditions on housing developments, and the recognition of Gaeltacht settlement patterns, to protect communities and support Irish speaking workers and families to make a life for themselves in the Gaeltacht.

Health

While the provision of health services falls under the HSE and the funding is provided by the Department of Health, there is a strong role local authorities can play in increasing health and wellbeing for everyone. Some of these, such as the provision of Primary Care Centres, involve local government working together with the HSE and central government.

Others, such as the provision of playgrounds and walking routes, are direct responsibilities of local authorities. The provision and maintenance of quality public spaces, leisure and other community facilities are means through which Councils can have a real impact. It must also be recognised that deprivation and poor living conditions have direct impacts on people’s health and wellbeing.

Sinn Féin councillors will champion local health services. Regional Health Forums provide an opportunity for councillors to deliver strong, effective local services such as sufficient GP care, more out of hours GP services, enhanced care in the community and to make better use of pharmacies through delivering a Pharmacy First model.

In their local health forums, Sinn Féin councillors will champion:

– Investment in local health services to deliver more GPs, directly hired GPs working in communities and more out of hours GP care.

– Delivery of a Pharmacy First model to make best use of community pharmacists to ensure speedier access to medicines and delivery of a minor ailment scheme.

– Youth mental health services and investment in local supports.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will:

– Prioritise the delivery of recreational amenities; including public spaces and leisure facilities.

– Working with communities to ensure everyone has access to clean, safe green areas to walk and play.

– Put in place a meaningful programme of footpath restoration so everyone can walk and move around their local area safely.

– Work with the NTA to discuss reforming the Active Travel Scheme to include existing footpaths and walkways that need maintenance.

– Ensuring public land is available, and correctly zoned, for Primary Care Centres included in the Sláintecare Plan.

– Establishing a taskforce in each individual local authority to resolve mould and damp issues in social housing.

– Work with local authorities to develop policies to ensure that those entering addiction treatment or hospital stays do not lose their housing entitlement upon discharge.

Cost of Living

A Sinn Féin government would take action to reduce the burden on workers and families because of the rising cost of living. We recognise that local authorities can play an active role in reducing the burden on workers, families, and local communities.

Management of waste is now more important than ever as the climate emergency requires comprehensive actions, including the development of the circular economy, with the aim of eliminating waste. But it is still the case that too much of the burden is borne by workers and families, and far too little by the industries that generate waste.

Household bills for waste collection are adding to the cost of living. Household waste collection was once a core service provided by local Councils. Now it is a lucrative industry, with the cost being borne by the service user. In parallel, the problem of illegal dumping has grown; with Councils picking up the cost.

We are the only state in Europe with a completely privatised waste collection service. We are also the only EU state persisting with ‘side by side’ competition for waste collection, leading to multiple companies driving through residential communities, often on successive days, adding to pollution and traffic problems.

Our privatised system is expensive, bad for the environment and severely lacking controls and regulations. Sinn Féin is committed to putting waste collection back under the control of local authorities. Sinn Féin would introduce the successful franchising model, already operating in several countries across Europe, and eliminate the ‘side by side’ model. This would be an important first step towards a return to waste collection directly by local authorities. This model would give power to local authorities to contract a single waste collection service for their area. The Council could insist on operating standards including affordable prices for householders and waiver schemes, and the company would be accountable to the local authority on whose behalf it is operating.

Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the Local Property Tax, which is a regressive, outdated tax that is not delivering the local services that people expect and deserve. Our councillors have helped to ensure that the tax is kept at the lowest possible level, especially given the pressure of the cost of living on workers and families. In government, we would abolish the LPT and instead deliver multi-annual, secure, and increased Exchequer funding for local authorities.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Pushing for increased social housing retrofitting to reduce bills for the most vulnerable households.

– Bringing waste collection services back under the control of local Councils. Increasing the provision of public waste services; such as bins and recycling centres. Reducing the Local Property Tax to the lowest possible amount in annual council budgets, until such time as it is abolished by a Sinn Féin government and is replaced by adequate, multi-annual funding from central government.

– Increasing the number of childcare spaces through the provision of more local authority led childcare facilities.

Safe Roads and Better Public Transport

Sinn Féin will ensure the delivery of safe roads and better public transport in local authorities.

Road safety and accessible transport are core proposals to ensure people can live and work safely in their communities. Green party Minister Eamon Ryan and his Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil government have consciously underfunded the budget for maintenance of local roads. The poor condition of our roads undoubtedly feeds into accidents.

2023 saw the highest number of deaths on our roads in almost a decade. Dublin has ranked worst, in public transport, of 30 European Cities in 2023 while large parts of rural Ireland are completely inaccessible by public transport. We also recognise that many children cannot safely access school without relying on a lift from parents.

As part of our plan to improve road safety, we must consider the roadworthiness of transport vehicles, and the education of drivers. In that regard, the waiting times for both NCT and NDLS appointments must be improved. Within one term of government, Sinn Féin will commit to hiring additional testers within both services to ensure a timely and effective access to car and driver testing.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

Delivering increased funding to ensure local roads are properly maintained.

Ensuring active travel teams are adequately staffed and properly resourced. Working with local communities to ensure footpaths and pedestrian infrastructure is fit for purpose.

Reviewing all active routes to schools in their area (existing and future) and develop improvement plans to be funded via the Department of Transport and National Development Plan and, where appropriate, to include requirements for significant future redevelopments to have designated bus collection and drop off points. Working to identify how underserved areas can be connected by public transport. Incorporating ‘Safe Routes to School’ into all Development Plans and Local Area Plans.

United Ireland

The Good Friday Agreement provides for referendums North and South on Irish Unity. Planning for these needs to begin now. We need a conversation on what kind of Ireland we want and how best to achieve it.

Partition has not served the people of Ireland. Sinn Féin is committed to an all-Ireland economy which builds upon existing cooperation and integration of services across the island, particularly in the areas of health, education, transport, agriculture and tourism.

All-Ireland planning for health will produce better outcomes. An all-Ireland education system will facilitate the sharing of resources and expertise, strengthen research and development and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the all-Ireland economy.

A united Ireland with a modern transport system will connect communities and move people, goods, and services across the island more efficiently. An all-Ireland agricultural sector will benefit rural Ireland and reduce the obstacles and red tape of working within two separate jurisdictions, and co-operation on environmental issues will assist in challenging the threat of climate change.

As a world-class tourist destination, a United Ireland will see all regions reach their full potential by creating employment and economic opportunity.

Local communities and local government have a key role to play in planning for Irish Unity, with Sinn Féin councillors working to establish Irish unity working groups in Councils and calling on the government to establish a Citizens’ Assembly on Irish unity. Proposals in support of these proposals have been passed in various Councils, such as South Dublin, Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan and Dublin, and other District Councils in the north.

Across the island of Ireland, the work of all Sinn Féin councillors is guided by the drive toward Irish Unity. Sinn Féin will promote co-operation across Councils, north and south, through enhancing existing cross-border agreements and relationships.

Sinn Féin will work to ensure that the benefits of cross-border funding are delivered for all communities. These include funding for the A5 North-West Transport Corridor, Casement Park, the Narrow Water Bridge connecting County Down to County Louth, hourly rail services between Belfast and Dublin, the Battle of the Boyne site in County Meath, Astronomical Observatories at Dunsink, Armagh and Birr and enterprise agencies’ co-operation schemes.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– The planning for, and promotion of, Irish Unity.

– Co-operation between local Councils, north and south, building on the work of existing cross-border, cross-council bodies and on Council initiatives such as those in County Donegal and Derry and Strabane District Council.

– Discussion on the harmonisation and integration of local government services across the island.

– Working to have the Irish government establish an all-island Citizens’ Assembly to discuss our constitutional future.

Making Local Government Work Better

A strong Sinn Féin team will fight for greater accountability in local Councils.

We currently have the most centralised system of local government in Europe with limited democratic decision-making powers and insufficient funding and resources for local authorities. This means that far too many decisions are made by unelected officials.

A Sinn Féin government would work to address this through a review of local government with a view to increasing powers and responsibilities of both elected Council and those who elect them.

We believe local authorities must be reformed. Accountability and transparency must be at the core of what they do. People must be able to access information, and we must work to remove any barriers that prevent this.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Tackling political exclusion by using D’hondt system, which is a fair and proportionate system to allocate committee chairs and membership of committee places.

– Increase transparency by mandating that all Council and Committee meetings be recorded and made available online.

– Reviewing the impact of Fine Gael and Labour’s decision to abolish town and borough councils with a view to supporting increased subsidiarity and accountability.

– Halting the privatisation of local Council services, while ensuring value for money for taxpayers.

– Exploring ways to increase the accessibility of Council meetings through subtitling or ISL interpretation.

– Reviewing localised budget processes to ensure that these are not used to plug gaps created by inadequate central government funding.

– Mandating the Chief Executive to publish an annual report detailing all motions passed in that year and an providing an update on their implementation.

– Exploring the potential to provide pooled staff resources for administrative work to all Councillors pending the full implementation of the Moorhead report.

– Establishing Local Authority Women’s fora.

Making Communities Accessible for People with Disabilities

1 in every 5 people have a disability of some form. We believe that supporting those with disabilities is about more than just paying lip-service.

In Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget 2024, we proposed that central government should support a Disabled Persons Organisations (DPO) Training and Development Fund and a Disability Inclusion Fund for all local Councils to support their specific disability inclusion requirements in line with the UNCRPD. In government, we would also increase funding for housing adaption grants.

Local authorities have a clear responsibility to create, maintain and support accessible spaces. Sinn Féin believe that when we create spaces that are accessible to our most vulnerable, they are accessible to everyone. This involves listening to disabled people and ensuring our community and public spaces do not place barriers in their way.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Recruiting a Disability Inclusion Officer in every local authority specifically to work to prevent decisions being made that create barriers for those with a disability. Ensuring all proposals for changes to public open spaces are reviewed through Universal Design Guidelines.

– Establishing a Voluntary Access Group, with people with disabilities as the core membership, in each local authority area.

– Utilising the NTA’s Walkability Audit when reviewing footpaths and routes for resurfacing and intervention.

– Drafting a Disability and Inclusion Strategy.

– Adapting existing homes and building new homes that are accessible.

Climate Action

Climate change and the challenge of reducing our carbon footprint to prevent further destruction of the planet must be a key consideration of decision makers in local government.

From returning vacant homes to use to making active travel a reality for people, a just transition is at the core of Sinn Féin’s proposals. We believe that supporting people to make environmentally sound decisions is the best way forward.

A Sinn Féin government would reform how retrofitting is funded, targeted, and delivered. Our policies would ensure that at least 75% of the funding for residential and community retrofits would be directed at those on low and modest incomes, so that achieving our climate targets go hand in hand with alleviating energy poverty and social deprivation.

We propose replacing the national retrofit programme with a new significantly different programme. We propose grants that are tiered so that the more help you need to afford a retrofit the more help you get. Our programme also includes area-based components to ensure more cost-effective and expedient delivery.

We propose a specific scheme for households relying on solid fuels - these are often cold, rural homes with the highest emissions; as well as the establishment of a dedicated fund for heat pumps given the urgent need to shift the fuel source of homes to renewable alternatives. In addition, Sinn Féin would prioritise and resource greater investment by local authorities in the retrofitting of their housing stock.

We believe that meanwhile use, which sees vacant commercial properties brought into temporary use, will help to end commercial vacancy.

In order to support real climate action Sinn Féin have proposed a dedicated public park and woodland fund, which would allow local authorities apply for funding to assist in the purchase or development of parcels of land for use as public parks and green areas.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Supporting the delivery and implementation of local climate action plans by ensuring all local authorities have designated Climate Action Officers and Coordinators.

– Protecting and enhancing biodiversity, expanding publicly owned and accessible green spaces and natural areas while contributing to carbon storage and sequestration.

– Mandating all local authorities with designated bathing areas to complete all year-round water quality testing Seeking to include district heating in new social housing developments where possible.

– Developing policies on ‘Meanwhile Use’ for all local authorities to help community groups and SMEs to understand the purpose, generate interest and afford developers greater confidence that they would get their site back.

– Prioritising coastal erosion and flooding prevention and management.

– Improving water quality.

Keeping Communities Safe

A strong Sinn Féin team will fight for more Gardaí – that are visible and on the beat.

The crisis in policing has seen attacks on Gardaí and unprecedented scenes of rioting and criminality in Dublin, with other cities also seeing significant and high-profile attacks.

Many suburban and rural communities feel badly let down by lack of Gardaí in their area, with Garda stations either closed entirely or operating severely reduced hours.

Across the State, anti-social behaviour is making communities feel at risk and businesses, workers and tourists have all expressed concerns about safety.

A Sinn Féin government would invest in a major Garda recruitment drive, along with introducing retention measures, to reduce resignations, and build Garda numbers. We would review the Community Safety Innovation Fund to ensure communities that are harmed most by criminality see proceeds of those crimes returned to them.

Sinn Féin also recognise the key role that fire fighters play in keeping our communities safe across the country; often at huge personal sacrifice to themselves.

Without urgent action to address the recruitment and retention crisis, the ability of these services to continue the work they do day in day is in doubt, putting lives at risk.

In government, we would provide capital funding to allow for the ongoing replacement of engines and other critical equipment, alongside the establishment of new stations where required.

All firefighters deserve financial security and peace of mind after years of service. Solving the recruitment and retention crisis within full-time and retained services which has worsened under this government will require all options to be examined.

A strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise:

– Reviewing existing JPC structures and community safety fora to ensure these work with, and complement, proposed Local Community Safety Partnerships.

– Supporting local authorities through budgetary processes to ensure there are sufficient Tenant Enforcement Officers in place.

– Identifying areas for Dumping Taskforces to be established.

– Supporting the development of relationships between local community Gardaí and vulnerable communities.

– Ensuring the proper allocation of resources to ensure sufficient staffing for full-time and retained fire stations, enabling firefighters to perform their duties safely and efficiently while safeguarding our communities.

– Ensuring local authorities provide the technical assistance and equipment to map new and existing buildings to ensure speedy sharing of information and prevent a potential disaster in high-rise buildings.

– Ensuring local authorities provide all fire services with a mapping system of all fire hydrants and relevant high risk categorisation information across the State.

"Local 2024: Social Democrats","Introduction

City and County Councils (‘local authorities’) contribute to wellbeing in their communities in many ways, most visibly by designing, creating and sustaining the environments in which people live, work, do business, and socialise. The facilities and services they provide play critical roles in local wellbeing.

Local authorities influence the quality of the places and homes in which we live; the strength and cohesion of our communities; how we move from place to place and connect with each other; our health and safety; our shared prosperity; how we spend our time; the environments in which people can exercise and relax; the strength of community and business relationships; and our sense of shared identity.

This June 7th , the people of Ireland have a chance to set Councils’ priorities for the next five years and elect people to our local Councils who will stand up for their interests and put their communities first.

As Social Democrats, our single biggest priority is to improve the delivery of key public services which drive equality, promote sustainability, reduce costs for businesses and families, and raise living standards for all the community. In all our endeavours, we will commit to the principle of inclusivity, ensuring no one is left behind, and to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (see Page 24), fostering a sustainable future for all.

This Manifesto sets out how Social Democrats Councillors will approach Council services and projects over the next five years. Some of the areas that we will focus on include:

– Housing: Councils must play a stronger role in ending the crisis in affordability. They must also plan for all of the infrastructure that goes with the building of new houses. We don’t just want to build new homes; we want to build sustainable communities.

– Environment: One report after another warns us of the impending perils of climate and biodiversity collapse. We are living way beyond the means of our planet and in the process causing irreversible damage to our natural environment. Local authorities must play their part in addressing this global issue.

– Service Delivery: The Social Democrats want to set new standards in how public services are delivered by local authorities and how local officials engage with local communities. We want to spread best practice across the country on public realm improvements, provision of community infrastructure and facilities, and investing in measures that bring about social cohesion.

– Youth: Our young people were left behind during the pandemic, and community facilities and services have yet to catch up. We want to strengthen social infrastructure for all age levels but with a particular focus on young people.

– Disability: Disabled people should be at the heart of all decisions that affect them. Our Councillors will prioritise the needs of people with disabilities, focusing on tangible improvements in accessibility, such as barrier-free public spaces, accessible public transport, and inclusive communication methods, ensuring that people with disabilities can fully participate in community life.

– More Inclusive Communities: Our Councillors will work to build inclusive local communities, that are respectful of all cultures and traditions. They will work on a collaborative basis with members of the Community & Voluntary sector, creating a platform where local charities and community groups can participate actively in policymaking at local government level and support thriving communities.

– Greater Participation: There are fine examples all around the country of successful Council projects such as on Community Budgeting, recycling projects, regeneration, and community engagement. Our Councillors will ensure that their Councils value honesty, integrity and transparency, and set high standards for themselves and their work. We will leverage digital tools and platforms to foster greater community engagement and participation in local governance, ensuring transparency and accessibility for all.

Building Homes, Increasing Affordability

Housing represents an unprecedented challenge, impacting countless lives across Ireland. For the second time in a generation, we are struggling through a savage crisis in housing affordability.

For far too long, housing policy in Ireland has been written by developers for developers. The results speak for themselves:

– Rents have almost doubled in a decade. – House prices have more than doubled.

– Large numbers of first-time buyers are effectively locked out of owning a home. – More than 13,500 people are currently living in homeless emergency accommodation, and many more are experiencing hidden homelessness.

The Social Democrats believe that housing is a fundamental right, needed to ensure people can live dignified lives without financial hardship, precarity or stress. This housing crisis won’t be solved unless we change the direction in housing policy, both at a national and local level.

We want to see far more affordable homes available to rent and buy. An increase in homes available to buy can only happen if there is a policy shift away from building rental-only developments.

We need to see an end to developer-led policymaking and a move to a housing and planning policy dictated by the public interest, with a clear aim to deliver housing at the lowest possible cost to families and individuals, rather than the highest possible profit to developers and land speculators.

To do this, we need to stop approaching housing and land as if they are commodities and start building homes using the extensive resources of the State. Local authorities have a crucial role to play in this, especially in building on public land that is at their disposal and working with other Government agencies to plan and deliver new homes.

The over-reliance on Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) works for no one bar landlords. It leads to greater demand for housing, inflating prices for those looking to rent privately. The Social Democrats believes that the best way to move away from HAP is the direct provision of public housing.

We are committed to taking action in the following areas:

Building Affordable Homes

We want to use the extensive residentially zoned public land that is available to local authorities to build homes that are affordable to rent or buy.

We would create a specific zoning for affordable housing so that only genuinely affordable homes could be built on specific areas of land.

Local Councils play a pivotal role in promoting equitable housing by partnering with non-profit developers, leveraging their commitment to community welfare over profit margins. This approach not only broadens access to affordable housing but also ensures that developments are community-oriented and sustainably managed. The success of the some models within the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector present a compelling blueprint for scalability, offering a proven framework for affordable, community-driven housing projects that we plan to expand across additional local authorities.

Our Councillors will work closely with AHBs to deliver more units and to ensure the Housing First programme is fulfilled.

Building Public Housing

We need to move away from a reliance on the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and expand the role of Cost Rental housing.

Local authorities used to play a far greater role in the direct construction of social housing. We will get local authorities back building again. At a national level, in Government we will build 12,000 social homes every year.

No More Long-Term Leasing

The Social Democrats want to ban longterm leasing as a method of social housing provision.

This expensive and wasteful policy where taxpayer money is used to fund lucrative deals with landlords and investment funds for up to 25 years, often handing over more than what it would have cost to buy the house, before handing it back to the owner – should be replaced with the direct building of social homes by local authorities that they themselves will own.

Tackling Homelessness

While strong national policy is what is required most to achieve the eradication of homelessness, local authorities have a statutory responsibility in the area and can be more ambitious than many have been to date.

Our Councillors will work to ensure that their local authority builds enough social housing to reflect demand in local social housing needs assessments.

They will also ensure that the type of housing built reflects the real size of households on the social housing waiting list. Often this will mean building more one-bed apartments and four-bed+ homes.

It is important that councils allocate a proportion of new build social homes to people who have been trapped in homelessness the longest, and that local authorities make decisions in the best interests of children when assisting families in homelessness.

Using Compulsory Purchase Orders

As a party, we want to use Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) to acquire land banks that will ensure a pipeline of development land for affordable housing.

Fifty years on from the Kenny report, the Government is still refusing to act on its recommendations. We would follow the

blueprint laid out in the report for a continuous supply of social and affordable homes by the State.

We would also be more proactive in our use of CPOs to buy and renovate derelict houses. A fund should be created at central government level to facilitate this.

Addressing Vacant Housing

We commit to lobbying for the appointment of at least one full-time Vacant Housing Officer within each local authority, tasked with identifying and mobilising vacant properties.

This initiative will be leveraged to rehabilitate hundreds of vacant units, focusing initially on publicly-owned properties, to swiftly address housing shortages. A priority area for us will be the revitalisation of 'over-the-shop' units, capitalising on this underutilised space to increase housing availability and town-centre living.

We will seek to use CPOs on vacant housing where appropriate, and nationally we favour the introduction of a tax on vacancy with real teeth to compel change of use. We would increase the vacant homes tax to 5 per cent. The current tax on vacant homes is set at a derisory 0.3 per cent, a figure that is easily gobbled up by property price inflation each year.

By increasing the tax to an effective rate, with fair exemptions, we would send a clear message to property speculators use it, sell it, or rent it.

Additionally, we will implement strategies to substantially reduce the duration that Council properties remain unoccupied, ensuring more homes become available again more quickly.

Using Brownfield Sites

We will ensure that each local authority on which we are represented works constructively with the Land Development Agency so vacant and brownfield sites that are suitable for residential development can be quickly brought into use.

We will invest in Suburban Renewal by utilising unused or under-used brownfield sites across our urban areas.

Enforcing the RZLT

We will ensure that our Councils properly engage with the legislation governing the Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT).

The RZLT has replaced the Vacant Sites Levy, which failed in large part due to the fact that a huge number of local authorities failed to engage with the terms of the Levy.

Land Value Capture

The correct strategy is for Councils to acquire land before rezoning so that its value is captured by the State and rezoning is not used to drive up the cost of purchasing it. The current process whereby land is re-zoned before state entities purchase it, allowing landowners to benefit greatly without any investment or effort in the land, wastes significant amounts of taxpayer money and encourages land speculation.

Social Housing Income Limits

We favour a regular review of income limits for social housing eligibility. This does not happen automatically, with the same limits applying for several years at a time, even when incomes are rising.

This makes no sense. Our public representatives will lobby at a national level for this to happen on a regular basis.

Improving Maintenance

We will act on behalf of Council tenants so that there are good response times to maintenance issues in local authority housing stock.

We will support technological solutions for housing maintenance which will ensure more efficient responses.

Ending tax perks for REITS

We are very concerned about the impact of bulk property purchases by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).

Under current arrangements REITs enjoy sizeable tax benefits and are using this position to purchase units in bulk.

New estates that were granted planning permission on the understanding they were to be a mix of owner-occupied and rental are now only available to rent.

First-time buyers are being deprived of an opportunity to bid for homes in their area, there is no tenure mix in some estates (as it is all private rental) and as the availability of housing for purchase falls, prices increase further.

The Social Democrats are committed to ending the preferential tax treatment of REITs and using the savings from this initiative to provide increased funding to local authorities for direct building of homes that ordinary people can buy.

Our Councillors and TDs will also bring about a change in the planning system so that bulk purchases by funds cannot happen.

Voluntary Step-down Housing

We will promote the reintroduction of a voluntary step-down housing scheme for older people, as previously existed in northwest Dublin and which was hugely popular.

These schemes provide older people living in homes that are larger than they need the opportunity to move voluntarily within their neighbourhood to accessible, sustainable and more manageable homes. They also free up larger homes for young families who require extra space.

Housing People with Specific Needs

Our Councillors will make sure our local authorities have adequate data on the housing needs of different groups of people living in the area so that housing needs can be matched with appropriate supply.

This includes people with disabilities (see our section on Disability), and the Traveller Community.

Our Councillors will fully implement the recommendations from the report of the Traveller Accommodation Expert Review Group. The State must end its violation of Travellers rights and provide adequate housing.

Building Sustainable Communities

Strategic and thoughtful planning is pivotal to enhancing community development and shaping vibrant, sustainable places.

Social Democrats don’t want to build just homes – we want to build communities.

That means making amenities, infrastructure, transport services, schools, retail, accessibility, and environmental sustainability central to every development.

Good planning has a huge influence on the quality of the places and homes in which we live. Good and bad planning can be a difference-maker in how strong and cohesive our communities are; how we spend our time, and connect with one another; our ability to strike a good work/life balance; our health and safety; and so many other aspects of our lives.

Good community facilities help to create strong communities. These include playgrounds, parks, community centres and other places where people can gather and connect. The provision of community facilities must be a central plank of policy at both a national and a local level.

Increasing tree planting and biodiversity projects in new developments, providing for allotments and community gardens, and connections to sustainable transport options including cycling infrastructure are also very important. Every local authority should have its own Tree Strategy.

Planning and building standards must be set high and rigorously enforced. Every house should have excellent ventilation, and every household should have a garden, balcony, or outdoor space of its own. We must also ensure all housing standards are set suitable for a future where more of us will be working from home.

Ireland has been let down by its planning system. So many of our problems – the high cost of housing, the traffic choking our towns and cities, our lack of basic amenities – can be attributed to the lack of sound long-term planning.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past.

Quality Infrastructure and Services

Our over-riding priority in planning is that Councils build infrastructure, transport links, and public services into every plan for our communities.

No homes should be built without a credible plan for the array of supports and infrastructure that communities need to thrive.

We commit to prioritising the inclusion of accessible public transport options, comprehensive cycling infrastructure, community playgrounds, playing fields (including all-weather amenities), expansive green spaces, childcare facilities, and vibrant retail and recreational facilities in all Local Area Plans.

We would like to see the appointment of architects at local authority level whose role it is to improve the aesthetic appearance of the public realm, for example by reducing street clutter and unnecessary signage, and pursuing creative ways to increase green space and spaces for play.

Every local authority should have its own Tree Strategy. We need to end excessive tree felling by introducing a better tree preservation processes, and ensuring that more heritage trees are protected with a ‘prune-first’ approach

15-Minute Cities

The concept of the 15-minute city is a vision of urban planning that prioritises proximity and accessibility to employment and essential services. Among its goals are a reduction in car

dependence, and improved quality of life for residents.

The characteristics of the 15-minute city vary by location and specific local needs, but generally include:

– Proximity to services – with workplaces, shops, schools, healthcare settings and parks within a fifteenminute walk or cycle from any point in the city or town.

– Infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists – with pedestrianised streets and cycle lanes designed to promote safe and sustainable active travel.

– High quality and regular public transport – with greater investment in buses, trams and trains to quickly connect people to different parts of the city.

– Quality public spaces – with priority given to the creation and preservation of accessible green spaces, parks, and sport/recreation areas.

The result of these measures is typically an improved quality of life, greater work/life balance (with less commuting time), and a greater sense of community among residents.

15-minute cities are environmentally sustainable.

Guided by the principles of the 15-minute city, Social Democrat Councillors will actively incorporate these values into the formulation of County Development and Local Area Plans, ensuring a holistic, resident-focused approach to urban development.

Inclusive Communities

For truly socially sustainable communities, it's imperative to develop diverse housing options crafted to universal design standards. This ensures accessibility and comfort for individuals across all age groups and those with disabilities, promoting inclusivity at every level.

In line with promoting accessibility, the 'dropped curb' principle should be integrated into all housing and urban development projects. This approach not only aids those with mobility challenges but also benefits the wider community by ensuring seamless access to public spaces and facilities.

Implementing universal design principles, broadening downsizing options and sheltered housing programs for the elderly, and securing dedicated funding for individuals transitioning from congregated settings, are critical steps. These measures facilitate more suitable living environments, catering to the nuanced needs of these communities.

New apartment blocks should Community Rooms as standard.

have

We must ensure that all Local Authority Integration Teams are fully staffed to welcome new arrivals into our communities, including extra resourcing in counties with large numbers of Ukrainians and International Protection applicants. Each local authority should have a local migrant integration strategy.

Development Levies

We will work to ensure that there is substantial community gain from development levies and that levies are clearly spent on improving social, community and physical infrastructure in the areas in which they are collected.

We will ensure that development levy schemes capture the existing needs and new needs of local areas.

Too many local authorities do not make enough provision for libraries, playgrounds, swimming pools, and other community facilities as part of their development levy scheme.

Public Land for Public Gain

We are dedicated to the strategic utilisation of public land for public gain, with a specific focus on enhancing housing, transport, and recreational provisions for the community. We want to significantly expand the Council’s landholding, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, for the purpose of housing delivery.

Assembling public land banks for the delivery of affordable housing is one of the key tools to addressing Ireland’s chronic housing problems and will be a key focus of our Councillors.

Planning Enforcement

We will ensure that the planning enforcement and derelict sites functions of our local authorities are active and responsive to complaints from the public and that there is proper follow through.

We will put a very strong emphasis on streamlining the ‘taking in charge’ process (see next page for more information). Too many new communities have been forgotten about by their local authority in recent years, or have been let down by developers from whom they have purchased their homes.

We will also ensure that the planning requirements related to short-term lets are enforced by local authorities.

Rainwater Harvesting

Across Ireland, in every city and county, we spend millions of euros every year treating all water in our mains to drinking standard. We then use that same water supply for flushing toilets, washing cars, watering gardens, washing clothes, and all sorts of purposes that do not require drinkingstandard water.

This is a huge waste of a treated resource, as well as a waste of nature's free resource of rainwater which, with our evermore built-up environment and more hard urban surfaces, is increasingly a cause of flooding.

Meanwhile the Government talks about pumping water from the Shannon to feed the demand for water on the East coast, while in other areas, such as West Cork, planning permission cannot be granted for any additional developments due to the lack of a viable source of water.

The Social Democrats want to make it the norm for rainwater harvesting, for use in toilets and washing machines etc, to be part of planning conditions for new housing developments.

Exemptions could be made for properties that do not have enough area from which to collect sufficient rainwater for the number of residents, or do not have sufficient garden space or access to bury a collection tank.

By providing a ‘distributed reservoir’, such tanks would also mitigate against flash flooding during extreme weather events,

especially on hard urban surfaces or following periods of drought.

Using this ‘grey’ water not only saves the treated water in Ireland’s grossly mismanaged water system, (for example, almost half of treated water in the Dublin area is lost to leakage) it reduces the runoff into the overburdened drains and culverts that were not built for the run-off that modern concrete and asphalt surfaces generate.

The more buildings that retain this ‘grey’"" water (which is actually very clean) the more treated water is saved and the better and protected our environs are from the impact of extreme weather events.

Dealing with Coastal Erosion

Several of our coastal communities are dealing with the problem of coastal erosion with, in some cases, houses literally falling into the sea or onto the beach as increasingly regular and severe storms erode the land underneath them.

Social Democrats Councillors will push for the full implementation of the recent Coastal Change Management Strategy Report, with dedicated teams for coastal regions featuring the necessary scientific, environmental and planning expertise around coastal erosion and flooding, with a focus on nature-based solutions.

We will engage closely with affected coastal communities; no one whose family home is at risk from coastal erosion or flooding should be left to fend for themselves.

Taking in Charge

The fact that it can take years and even decades for public areas in newer developments to be taken in charge by Councils is completely unacceptable.

Many residents have been left with completely unsatisfactory services such as roads, pathways, public lighting, green spaces, and other amenities. This leaves residents in limbo, and, in some cases, having to pay for basic public services such as street lighting, road repairs and liability insurance. In some cases, estates have been waiting since the 1970s.

Our Councillors will make this a priority issue and fervently represent the interests of residents living in unfinished estates:

Monitoring and Incentivising

We will ensure local authorities have a proper tracking system in place so that these estates are not forgotten, and developers are constantly reminded of their outstanding responsibilities.

It is important that people living in affected estates know their rights. Councils should appoint liaison staff to deal with the estates affected.

We will not accept sub-standard finishing and will ensure that a robust bond system is in place so that there are appropriate incentives for developers to finish out estates. Any bonds accepted by planning authorities as security should be index-linked, provided by operators regulated by the Central Bank, and sufficient to cover the cost of satisfactory completion of the development in question.

National Level

Nationally, we will seek much stronger protection for residents, including strengthening the powers of local authorities to be proactive in taking new developments in charge, stronger powers of enforcement for Councils to pursue

developers, and a dedicated fund to help the worst affected estates.

Local Property Tax Reform

We want to see an arrangement in place for lower Local Property Tax charges where estates are waiting to be taken in charge.

This will be fairer to residents and incentivise local authorities to work with developers to get estates finished quickly.

International Best Practice

It is worth noting that most European countries have no ‘taking in charge’ process, as local authorities build and maintain the public spaces and amenities, often collecting compensation from the developer to pay for their construction.

Before the land is rezoned there is a fully binding legal agreement on how the developer will pay the local authority to put in public amenities.

Areas that are public and to be taken in charge should be specified in the planning permission, and completed and handed over to the local authority within the timeframe of the planning permission.

Council Services – Getting the Basics Right

The Social Democrats want to set new standards in how public services are delivered by local authorities and how local officials engage with local communities. As is evident throughout this Manifesto, we want to spread best practice across the country.

As a first step, we want the role of National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) to be expanded. Far more measures of Council activity, or lack thereof, should form part of its auditing processes. Communities should know how well their local Council is doing across all possible measure of service.

Social Democrat Councillors will proactively engage with Council management to ensure that basic public services are not only performed well but are also delivered in a timely manner.

Our Councillors will strategically utilise the Council’s Service Delivery Plan and Council meetings as platforms to spotlight and advocate for the enhancement of basic service delivery and overall Council performance in key areas such as:

Road and Footpath Repairs

Drinking Fountains

Hedge-cutting

Vacant Homes

Litter Control and Dumping Enforcement

Community Engagement

Drainage

Public Toilets

More Benches

Graffiti Removal

Planning Enforcement

Parks Maintenance

Recycling Facilities

Housing Allocations and Maintenance

Street Cleaning

Tree Planting and Maintenance

Road Safety

Derelict Sites

Public Lighting

Playground Maintenance

Promoting Enterprise

Here, and in subsequent sections of this document, we outline some specific areas where we feel Councils can generally do so much better.

Public Realm Improvements

Local authorities should prioritise placeshaping and improvements to the public realm as a fundamental responsibility, with a particular emphasis on enhancing public spaces to foster community engagement and wellbeing.

Implementing straightforward, effective measures such as adding additional bins, installing more public benches (especially, but not exclusively, in parks and green areas), and maintaining footpaths can significantly enhance public space quality.

Ensuring the cleanliness and maintenance of cities and towns is crucial for the health and aesthetics of our communities, a basic yet vital function of local authorities. These are some of the most basic functions of local authorities, and our Councillors will have a strong focus on getting them right.

It's essential to allocate funding towards environmental improvements, including enhanced street lighting, better accessibility features for wheelchairs and buggies, and thoughtful landscaping to beautify and functionalise urban spaces, while also incorporating the principals of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED, see Page 51).

We would also like to see the appointment of architects at local authority level whose role it is to improve the aesthetic appearance of the public realm.

Examples might include by reducing street clutter and unnecessary signage, and by pursuing creative ways to increase green space and spaces for play. We will put a priority on ensuring that street and road networks are designed in a way that allows for safe access to schools and childcare facilities for our children. We will also work to ensure the public realm is more accessible for our elderly, including more age-friendly parking spots.

Public Toilets

Addressing the shortage of public toilet facilities in our towns and cities is imperative for public health and convenience, a clear area for improvement compared to European norms.

There is just one public outdoor toilet facility in the whole of Dublin city (at St Stephen’s Green). The closest other public toilets are at Sandymount Strand and Clontarf, which each have one single automated public toilet. Our Councillors want to increase the prevalence of public toilet facilities in all our towns and cities.

Ideas such as setting up coffee shops in parks, providing toilets, should be examined, as should the possibility of working with cafés, restaurants, and bars on developing an incentivised scheme where the public can use toilet facilities in return for reduced commercial rates.

Drinking Fountains

Another major difference between Irish towns and cities and those in other European countries is the dearth of free drinking water and drinking fountains.

Our Councillors will work to make the availability of clean free drinking water standard across the local authorities on which we are represented.

Childcare

It is not acceptable that the shortage of childcare facilities is such a severe issue in so many areas of the country. There is evidence that, while national standards exist for new developments to include childcare facilities, these are often being waived by local authorities. This is completely unacceptable and Social Democrats Councillors will make sure that

this is not done on any developments within their area.

future

We will use the Council’s role as part of the County Childcare Committee to promote better information to parents on childcare options and to better inform policy in respect of capacity shortages and fees.

Education

Our Councillors will support funding for community-based education programmes including those related to adult literacy, digital skills and vocational training.

Where possible, we will use the position of Councils on the boards of Education and Training Boards to promote educational access for all and high education standards, and to uphold the constitutional rights of children and their parents to not attend religious instruction classes.

Paying Bills

We would like Councils to make it as easy as possible for residents to pay their bills.

In particular we would like to see a pay-as-you-go scheme adopted by Councils to facilitate payment of Motor Tax so low-income households are not faced with large annual bills that can send them into the hands of moneylenders. We would also like to see a restructuring of motor tax charges so that people who can’t afford annual tax discs face no additional charges.

Improved Training and Feedback

We will work to improve Council training and other supports for the establishment of Residents Associations and other local groups, including Tidy Towns and environmental groups. We are also keen to promote customer service initiatives so that there are regular feedback opportunities for the public on services.

The online ‘Citizen Hub’ of Dublin City Council is an excellent model that we would like to see rolled out nationally. It is a central hub where people can check their position on the housing list, report dumping, request footpath repairs, apply for disability home improvement grant, and many other things, all without the clientelism that comes with going through elected Councillors for what should be readily available basic information and easy communication with the City Council. We would work to roll out similar Hubs in all local authorities to empower citizens.

Across the different local authorities, there is variance in policies on providing information to people on the local housing waiting list. Several local authorities do not inform people or families where they are on the list. Making such information available to people can have a disproportionately positive psychological effect, allowing them to manage expectations and make long-term plans accordingly. Many people communicating with our Councillors find the deprivation of such information to be little short of cruel.

Other Services

We will lobby for increased funding from national government do deal with issues like rat infestations.

We will ensure that Councils meet their obligations under the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty. We will work with Councils to adopt an anti-racism strategy for each Council area in respect of Council services and duties.

In general, we believe that too many services that should be a basic function of local government are being outsourced. Even, in some cases, the delivery of public lighting has been privatised, and has too often led to a sub-standard service with little accountability.

Investing in Play, Sport and Recreation

Social Democrats Councillors are committed to prioritising play, sport and recreation opportunities for all ages and abilities.

Ireland has poor social infrastructure and were it not for the tremendous success of voluntary organisations such as the GAA and others, we would have very little indeed.

We need a renewed focus on bringing our communities together and investing in shared spaces. The Social Democrats want to set a general target of a community centre in every significant population base in Ireland. This can be made available to young and old alike, and funded by an enhanced Sports Capital Programme and the National Development Plan.

Across the country, there is growing demand for youth work facilities, a growing population of young people (the 10-24-year-old population increased 14 per cent between 2016 and 2022, compared to an 8 per cent increase in the wider population), and there is limited funding available to youth work organisations for new builds or improvements.

The exception is through the Department of Rural and Community Development’s Community Centres Investment Fund, of which less than 5 per cent went to youth work project and organisations in 2022. Any new builds under this fund require partnerships with local authorities.

Integration of new communities is a huge benefit of investing in things like sport and recreation. They break down barriers and build a sense of a broader community across different groups. Youth clubs and groups can have an important role to play in welcoming and helping young people integrate into new communities. We also believe that better funding of youth services and their facilities can help prevent social challenges such as anti-social behaviour and crime in communities.

We can do so much better with the community facilities we already have or those that are in planning. The model developed at Fingal County Council, known as the “Fingal Schools model”, is a good example where it was agreed to co-locate new schools with community facilities on sites made available by the Council (more on Page 18).

We would like to see this model replicated in other areas. Where feasible from a security and residential amenity point of view, school facilities should be made available for after-hours community use.

We are committed to making improvements in the following areas:

Investing in Youth Facilities

Having down-time is vital to our health. But where do teenagers go for this?

Our young people are spending more and more time in school or online. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to physical and mental health problems. Young people are often lonely and isolated – and may feel overwhelmed by both the real life and virtual worlds they occupy.

The provision of additional community facilities for young people will be one of the biggest priorities for our Councillors.

There has not been enough investment in facilities and services for young people. Nonetheless, some Councils have shown that even with limited resources and by engaging in a genuine partnership with the community, they can play a key part in helping their local communities provide for this age group.

(As an example, the aforementioned Fingal Schools model, see next page).

Social Democrats Councillors are committed to maximising Council resources such as empty or under-used buildings, community/sports support workers, and other Council resources and facilities to improve youth services and in particular to offer alternatives to young people who don’t engage in mainstream sports and activities.

Our Councillors will also aim to build support for investment in youth work facilities and infrastructure into County Development Plans. Their work will be based on engagement with young people and local youth work organisations, with a goal of ‘futureproofing’ the local authority area based on demographic projections.

Better Sports Facilities

We should be seeking, through the Sports Capital Grants Programme, to provide a Multi-Use Games Area, or MUGA, pitch in every community where feasible. MUGA pitches should be open access, by which we mean open to a variety of different groups. These have worked very well in several communities where an appropriate location was identified and where strong community support was forthcoming.

Social Democrats Councillors will play an active part in maximising the funding of community facilities, such as swimming pools and skate parks, through the Sports Capital Programme and if in Government we will maintain a funding programme on an annual basis.

We want to expand the number of parks with strip lighting so that joggers can use parks safely after dark.

The Social Democrats also wish to maximise playing time for local sports clubs on Council pitches. The upkeep of some Council facilities leaves a lot to be desired. Poor drainage, irregular mowing, poor maintenance, or indeed closing down pitches/facilities at certain times of the year all impact on how active our children, young people and adults can be.

This is unacceptable. It breaks very positive routines and is a factor in children dropping out of sport. We will end the practice of Councils shutting playing pitches during the year, other than for maintenance and pitch recovery.

All-weather Facilities

As well as developing open-access MUGA pitches, we want to see an increased

prevalence of all-weather pitches and sporting facilities in our communities.

Their importance has been particularly evident over the course of this year, where an unusually wet Spring has left many playing pitches unusable and has led to the cancellation of training and/or matches for many sports clubs.

Replicating the Fingal Model

Councils and communities need to do better with the community facilities we already have or those that are in planning.

The model developed at Fingal County Council, known as the “Fingal Schools model”, is a good example where it was agreed to co-locate new schools with community facilities on sites made available by the Council.

Under this model, development levies were used to build shared school and community facilities; the pooling of resources means schools get the benefit of better facilities for use during the day, and the wider community can use the same facilities during the evening and at weekends.

We would like to see this model replicated in other areas.

Where feasible from a security and residential amenity point of view, school facilities should be made available for after-hours community use.

Providing Playgrounds

Our Councillors will prioritise the provision of playgrounds, including side-by-side play opportunities for people with disabilities. Our Councillors have already delivered a successful model in Greystones that could be replicated.

Playgrounds should be seen as not only an investment in children but as a great way

to bring communities together, foster social interaction, and provide a focal point for parents and grandparents.

We want to see greater provision of playgrounds across the country, particularly in counties with fast population growth over the past few years.

We are conscious that the positioning of playgrounds in local communities is an important factor for consideration to promote community buy-in, to reduce the risk of vandalism, and to minimise antisocial activity.

We also need facilities for older children including play spaces and skate parks. Public consultation will be a vital part of every playground and park proposal.

Promoting Active Lives

The emergence in recent years in certain Council areas of mid-night leagues, passports for leisure, and the Park Run phenomenon shows that Councils can play a huge role in keeping people active – and at relatively low marginal costs. We will work to expand these across the country.

We believe the Council can also play a strong role in supporting local Arts groups and we will look to support such groups in our communities.

Social Democrats Councillors will ensure that there is a play and activities plan for every age category in every local authority in which we are represented. We will focus on driving up participation in sports and activities for all age groups.

We will aim to provide more free gym and exercise equipment in public parks, and support the development of lidos and other outdoor swimming facilities.

Dog-walking and Dog Parks

We want to encourage the use of our public parks by dog-owners, and recognise that a balance must be struck between the interests of dog-owners and of other park users, particularly young children.

We are committed to developing dog parks within parks which have sufficient space. These would be designated areas where people can walk their dogs off a lead, without inconveniencing other park users.

From an animal rights perspective, we will ensure that dog pounds contracted by councils operate in a humane manner and promote animal welfare.

Community Gardens & Allotments

We will also work to improve access to, and expand, the number of public allotments and community gardens.

Our Councillors will encourage councils to use vacant and derelict land for community gardening where appropriate, and will promote events like National Allotments and Community Gardens Week.

We believe there is significant demand for both, and where possible, our Councillors will attempt to measure this demand in their area.

We will also examine the possibility of creating ‘seed libraries’ in council offices or public library premises, and of adding

contact details for allotments and community gardening to council websites.

We will seek to provide council funding for local artists to create art in community gardens.

Men’s Sheds

As a party, we are enthusiastic about supporting the network of Men’s Sheds across Ireland to continue expansion, through provision of premises and financial (particularly start-up funding) and other supports.

Often obtaining of a suitable premises is one of the most challenging aspects of establishing a Men’s Shed. We will ask Councils to audit unused properties in their possession and identify the properties that could be suitable for use as a Men’s Shed.

Festivals & Cultural Events

There are some fantastic examples around the country where Councils have partnered with local communities to deliver superb local festivals, and cultural and heritage events. These events promote a strong sense of place and civic pride in our communities, as well as driving tourism and economic activity.

Social Democrats Councillors will promote such activities in our Councils and we will use the resources of our Council as a key enabler for further events. We are also keen to address the escalating insurance costs faced by such events.

Putting a Focus on Libraries

One of the success stories of local government in Ireland has been our libraries. Local public libraries do so much to support community life; providing internet access, digital skills classes, book clubs, and so much more.

The Social Democrats value the role libraries play and see them as a key tool in promoting adult literacy, life-long learning, and community engagement, amongst many other things.

We want to see libraries as a focal point in our communities, focusing on enabling public libraries to offer an open, accessible, safe, and creative space to their local communities. We will ensure that Councils retain a strong focus on libraries, and we will work to expand the range of library services wherever possible.

Our priorities on libraries include:

Community Space & Accessibility be delivered in alignment with the national

strategy on literacy and numeracy.

We will ensure that meeting, study, and social space is freely accessible for individuals, local organisations and groups.

Accessibility and ease of use of libraries and their systems should be continually improved to optimise the user experience for all, including disabled people.

We will also support the appointment of full-time Irish language officers and an increase in the availability of services and materials in the Irish language.

Reading and Education Services

We will work to expand the Right to Read programme and Right to Read Local Networks, to increase the participation of children and young people, families, and adults in reading activities.

We will work to build on the current provision of library services to local primary and secondary schools, and explore the potential for an expanded programme of library supports which can

Funding for Additional Services

We will seek to increase funding for libraries to support greater service provision.

This will include working with our parliamentary party and government departments and agencies to explore potential additional funding sources for projects focused on community regeneration, including the opportunity to develop library facilities.

Our public libraries have the potential to be not just libraries of books, but ‘Libraries of Things’; places where you can borrow a guitar, a sewing machine, or a chessboard and pieces. Such libraries are common in other countries, but unheard of in Ireland. It would be more sustainable and cost-effective if, as a society, we bought less and borrowed more, and such libraries would assist in this goal.

Disabled People at the Heart of all Decisions

Social Democrats Councillors are fully committed to ensuring that people with disabilities are a priority in the Councils on which we serve.

Each of our elected Councillors will campaign for much better access for people with disabilities, and ensure their voice is heard in Council decisions that affect them.

Our Councillors will be guided by the principles of:

– Accessibility – Making all local public services fully accessible, and catering to a wide range of disabilities, including physical, sensory, learning, and neurodivergent needs.

– Participation – Ensuring the participation of people with disabilities on local decision-making structures.

– Planning – Making sure local authorities publish an implementation plan for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).

However, accessibility and participation have not been the experience of disabled people to date.

Instead, people with disabilities often face inaccessible walkways (for example roadworks being undertaken with no consideration for wheelchair users or those with visual or other impairments), low (or non-existent) levels of accessible public transport, or information being provided by local authorities and service providers that is not in an accessible format.

Recent urban planning trends have seen a prioritisation of cyclists at the expense of pedestrian safety, particularly impacting those with mobility or sensory impairments, necessitating a more balanced approach to public space design.

Clear commitments to people with disabilities should be embedded in council strategies and plans, including County Development Plans, and where we have Councillors elected, we will lead the charge on this.

The UNCRPD

The Social Democrats are committed to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).

We want to ensure disabled people are consulted at planning stages and throughout the completion of building works.

We recognise the importance of designing public consultations in an accessible format (with hybrid consultation events, held at accessible venues etc.), and with multiple ways for people to contribute their thoughts, opinions and needs.

Structured consultation between elected local representatives, council staff and people with a disability is essential to avoid the continuance of the problems noted on the previous page. Once a robust and regular consultation process is in place, issues can flow from it.

Improving Accessibility

Our Councillors will insisting that the Disability Access Officer in each local authority is a full-time position. Many local authorities do have a full-time Disability Access Officer, but this is not standard across local authorities.

We are committed to creating accessible buildings, paths and walkways, and making sure accessibility concerns are included in all restoration and refurbishment projects over which the local authority has control, or a funding role. Local authority offices should meet universal design requirements.

We will work to ensure council staff are trained on issues of disability equality and the use of ‘Plain English’. Where possible, this training should be given by disabled people.

A “Plain English” approach in all Council material is imperative, as is encouraging each of our Councils to work with the National Adult Literacy Agency in executing this approach.

We will work for increased accessibility of information, including ensuring council documents are available in different formats, including Easy Read versions. Local authority websites should meet webaccessibility standards, so that people can access information and navigate the site easily.

We are also committed to drawing attention to the national target of 6 per cent of Council employees having a disability and encouraging local authorities to meet this target

Housing

It is our policy to increase the number of wheelchair-liveable homes and universally- designed homes in each local authority area.

We want to make sure our local authorities have adequate data on the housing needs of people with disabilities living in the area so that housing needs can be matched with appropriate supply.

This might require undertaking disability audits in the local area.

We will work to improve efficiencies so that disabled people can secure housing

adaptation grants they are entitled to in a timely fashion. And we will make sure dedicated social housing provision, appropriate to the needs of disabled people, is delivered matching the scale and extent of the need identified within the local authority area.

Transport and Mobility

Our Councillors will fight for more accessible public transport in both urban and rural areas, with increased frequency and increased connectivity across all modes of public transport in our local communities.

We will ensure that the infrastructure for public bus, taxi and rail stops/stations is well maintained and accessible for disabled people.

Our local authority areas need a a sufficient number of disabled parking bays in villages and towns. We will seek increased funding and resources for footpath repairs. Footpath surfaces in bad disrepair have the greatest negative effect on disabled people and the elderly.

Equality of Access to Amenities

Social Democrats Councillors will work to ensure that all local sporting facilities,

libraries, museums, theatres, festival venues and community spaces are accessible where disabled people can participate and enjoy these local amenities, with access to toilet facilitates and changing places.

It is important that we make public playgrounds and amenities accessible to all to promote inclusive play, ensuring children with disabilities can participate and are not segregated from their peers.

Making local recreation sites and tourist attractions accessible, including ensuring there is a beach mobility wheelchair for local beaches must also be a priority.

We will work to expand the number of playgrounds, pools, gyms, parks and green spaces, and venues that are universally designed.

In particular, we want to ensure that all future Council recreational projects include accessible changing facilities to ensure the health, safety and dignity of those with disabilities and mobility issues, as well as accessible toilets which include a hoist, adult-sized changing bench, and larger space for additional assistants.

Sustainable Development Goals

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, is a shared blueprint for prosperity and sustainability.

At the heart of the agenda are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global partnership.

They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our natural environment.

Our Councillors will advocate for, and promote, the UN Sustainable Development Goals in their work on each local authority on which we are represented.

Creating Cleaner Greener Communities

Climate change is the single biggest threat to our environment, to our living standards, and to our existence.

The Social Democrats recognise this threat as a fundamental issue facing our country and our planet. Everybody has to play their part in tackling it and preparing for its consequences.

Though climate change is a global issue, it can only be tackled by every part of Government doing its bit.

At the national level, we will advocate for clean energy initiatives, such as offshore wind energy, widespread adoption of electric vehicles, enhanced flood defences, and universally accessible home insulation grants.

Councils must play their part also. Our Councillors will:

– Drive strong long-term planning for sustainable communities; – Support increased investment in cycling and public transport;

– Promote biodiversity, recycling, and strong anti-dumping measures; – Encourage new energy solutions and put Councils at the heart of delivering them.

The Climate Change Adaptation Strategies being implemented by Councils nationwide are crucial for formulating workable and actionable plans to locally address climate change. These strategies are especially vital for managing coastal erosion, flood defence, and planning for extreme weather events.

Urgent progress is required on the stalled Marine Protected Areas bill. The Social Democrats want to see a moratorium on licences to pump raw sewage into protected waters, and immediate revocation of existing licences.

Please also see the sections in this document on Transport, Cycling, Litter and Dumping, Recycling and Waste, Plastics, Biodiversity, and Energy Communities for further details of actions we propose.

There are many ways Councils and Councillors can make an impact on climate change.

– Promoting better coordination and collaboration among different Strategic Policy Committees to address the cross-cutting issue of Climate Change more effectively.

– Supporting the development of green infrastructure including hedgerows, wetland restoration, and woodland expansion.

– Leading by example in housing design and energy saving in the Council’s own buildings.

– Designated drop off points around our urban centres within a 1 km radius of schools, so students walk on dry mornings.

– Supporting and facilitating Cycling Buses for children travelling to school.

– Bicycle shelters and secure lock-ups at all public buildings.

– Promoting the use of surplus heat in district energy schemes.

– Reducing energy consumption by accelerating the transition to lowenergy LED public lighting.

– More public recycling bins.

– Better collection opportunities at

amenity centres for mattresses, sofas,

– Promoting and expanding the number of community gardens and allotments where feasible. Our Councillors will encourage councils to use vacant and derelict land for community gardening where appropriate.

– Making sure there is at least one water inspector for each local authority, ensuring year-round testing of water quality at bathing spots and in rivers.

– Enhancing biodiversity through creating native Woodland Walks and Wildflower Meadows in existing and new parks.

– Advocating for local authorities to cease the use of glyphosate in public open spaces.

– Greater availability of clean free drinking water and water fountains.

– Increased prevalence of rainwater harvesting as a standard practice in our communities. (See Page 13).

– Require each local authority to develop a local clean air strategy.

– Provide funding for the environmental department in Councils to have at least one staff member focused on clean air and related environmental issues.

large plastic toys etc.

– Adequate numbers of car-charging points in every small town and village.

– An end to single-use plastic at council events and timelines to end or reduce them in council supported events.

– Supporting representation from environmental, community, and cycling groups on Council Committees.

Tackling Litter and Illegal Dumping

We believe our Councils can play a much bigger role in tackling litter and illegal dumping. As judged by the number of fines issued, there is significant variance in the level of enforcement activity by local Councils.

Similarly, the level of funding per capita for local authorities under the Local Authority Enforcement Measures Scheme varies widely.

As with general financing of local authorities, the Social Democrats believe there needs to be an evidence-based approach to the funding local authorities receive to tackle dumping. There is no apparent reason why some counties get several times the fund funding per capita under this scheme that others get.

The Social Democrats will ensure that every local authority adopts a clear strategy on dumping and takes a zero-tolerance approach to offenders.

Our Councillors will take the following actions and approaches:

Naming and Shaming

The Social Democrats favour a naming and shaming policy for people found guilty of illegal dumping. Our Councillors will explore all legal avenues to bring this about.

We will also seek to deploy technology, including CCTV, wherever feasible to identify and catch culprits.

More Public Bins

We will reverse the trend of Councils removing public bins.

We are particularly keen that additional bins are provided in areas such as around bus-stops and taxi ranks, on approaches to schools, and outside neighbourhood shops. We also need more underground waste bins, which have much larger capacity.

We will also promote the expansion of Council furniture/junk collection days as resources allow.

Community Cleanup

We will promote and support residents’ clean-up days and work side by side with Tidy Towns committees to deliver cleaner environments in our communities.

This will include promoting beach, canal, and neighbourhood clean-up days, with a special emphasis on removing plastic pollution.

Our Councillors will support the fantastic work of Tidy Towns groups and work with them to increase the positive impact they have on the cleanliness and biodiversity of their communities.

Facilitating Good Behaviour

Public facilities for disposal of nonrecyclable material should have longer weekend and evening opening hours.

The easier it is to dispose of unwanted items the less likely there will be a problem with dumping.

Charges for bringing disposable items to public facilities should be as uniform as possible across the country and should be pitched at a level that discourages dumping.

Regarding the issue of dog waste, we will replicate a successful community experiment where dispensers with free doggy bags were erected at entrances to parks, resulting in a significant reduction in the problem.

We also wish to expand the number of bins so that dog-owners can easily dispose of dog litter. Too often, these bins are left overflowing and are not emptied.

Tackling Bad Behaviour

We want to hire more litter wardens and improve the enforcement process. We favour the doubling of on-the-spot fines for littering and further increasing fines for illegal dumping.

In turn, we want to double funding to the anti-dumping initiative so that detection, enforcement and clean-ups can be improved.

It is vital that penalties for illegal dumping are actually applied. Enforcement bodies are too often failing in their duties to apply appropriate penalties. Our Councillors will work to ensure that fines are applied at a level that reflects the risk posed to, or damage exacted on, the environment.

An estimated 50,000 households dispose of their waste in an unregulated manner according to the County and City Management Association. We will focus on reducing this figure.

We want to set strict enforcement targets for local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency to deal with the chronic problem of illegal dumping, as well as infringements of conditions attached to waste licences and permits.

We would improve national funding to allow the recruitment of additional staff in this area.

We would double on-the-spot litter fines from €150 to €300 to improve the deterrent of dog-owners not picking up after their pet.

Investing in Recycling

Most People want to do their best for their environment and play their part by recycling as much as possible. However, we are not making it easy for them.

Our current recycling system is inadequate. There isn’t enough basic information for consumers on how and where people can recycle materials and items, and the recycling system in Ireland can’t handle many goods that are sold in our shops.

We need national legislation on banning certain single use plastics and microplastics, and a new national and EU strategy to tackle unrecyclable packaging. Local authorities have a key role to play in this.

The Social Democrats want our Councils to take the lead again on recycling. Some of them have very committed staff doing a great job in their area but many could do so much better.

We believe that:

– Consumers must have much better information so that they can make informed choices on minimising their waste and maximising their recycling, reuse, and repair opportunities.

– We need a completely new process that is more effective in minimising waste so the volume of unrecyclable products reaching our supermarket shelves is vastly reduced and so that recyclable waste that is currently not collected as part of household collection services can be recycled.

– Local authorities can play a much bigger role by expanding the number of Civic Amenity Centres, making waste charges affordable, expanding opening hours of bring centres, and providing better options for recyclable material that is currently not part of kerbside collection.

We are proposing a mixture of practical local and national measures to vastly improve the effectiveness of work local authorities are doing promoting recycling and the circular economy.

Better Recycling/Repair Options

We believe that funding for the development of recycling centres should be reinstated, and the number of centres expanded so that there is at least one civic amenity centre for every population centre.

We will work to spread best practice around the country. The recycling centre in Bray, County Wicklow, is a very good example of where the public service has partnered with charity shops to allow residents dispose of certain unwanted material.

We would like to end the practice of waste collected in public bins going to landfill and we will roll-out segregated public waste bins.

The Social Democrats will to support the creation of more social enterprises such as the Rediscovery Centre, Food Cloud, and Recreate Ireland.

We believe the tax code and commercial rates system should be examined and reformed to promote better second-hand markets and repair businesses.

We will explore, through the European Institutions, the possibility of reduced VAT rates for the repair of goods and how better regulation could ensure goods are longer lasting and repairable.

Improved Information & Education

We need far better customer information on recycling – what can be recycled, where it can be recycled, and which bin can it go into.

While the development of www.mywaste.ie has been welcome, it is far too basic. If waste can’t go in a household recycling or compost bin, then consumers should know where in their area an item can be recycled. Such

information is still not readily available in some local authorities.

There is also much confusion among the public as to what the different recycling emblems on packaging mean. Our Councils can play a stronger role in making this information available.

We believe education on recycling, reducing and re-using can also be improved in our schools, building on the success of the Green Flag initiative.

New Recycling Targets

We want to see new targets established for the percentage of domestic households and businesses that have recycling bin and compost bin services, with a particular focus on apartments and rural areas.

At the last count, the percentage of households with three bins in some counties remains too low.

We also want to see new specific targets set for recycling in places of employment – an area that has been badly neglected.

Responsible Disposal

We strongly support the principle that waste is treated/disposed of as close as possible to where it is generated.

This is not only in the interests of fairness, but it also incentivises waste reduction within regions. It also minimises emissions, congestion and pollution risk associated with transporting waste across the country

We will insist on transparent emissions monitoring for all waste facilities. We believe current systems are inadequate, especially in respect of waste incinerators.

In some cases, waste licences are being granted on inappropriate sites close to residential homes. We will insist that the

EPA and local authorities meet their responsibilities around only allowing waste operations on suitable sites and under strict and enforceable conditions.

We will insist on proper compliance with the assessment process.

We favour the introduction of a levy on aggregates such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone that are extracted from the ground and used in construction.

This levy should be set at a level to encourage the recycling of construction and demolition waste and to reduce the amount of waste being landfilled. Proceeds should be set aside for the environmental fund.

New Structures on Waste

We are calling for a fundamental review of the effectiveness of the Repak Scheme in how we approach waste and the respective roles of producers, retailers, and consumers.

In particular, we need to re-examine responsibilities of retailers and manufacturers in reducing the plastic used for the packaging of products, especially loose products. Local authorities often end up picking up the costs of this flawed system.

The waste sector in Ireland is not adequately regulated. There is still no economic regulator for the sector. This has meant that several areas of the country have no competition for their waste services.

It has also led to a situation where, almost uniquely in developed countries, Ireland has a “side-by-side” competition model for waste services – by far the most costintensive model a country can have. The lack of a regulator also makes it very difficult to apply basic standards to waste companies.

The Social Democrats believe the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities should be established as the regulator of the waste industry, and that in the short-term we should transition to a system whereby competition works on a “for the market” basis.

We believe this can allow for the remunicipalisation of waste services in certain circumstances and we note the savings that accrued in Lyon, France, and other cities when this happened.

Ultimately, we would like to see a transition to full re-municipalisation where resources, costs and consumer interests allow.

Tackling the Plastic Problem

Plastic has become endemic in our culture. It is now almost impossible to avoid purchasing daily necessities without also purchasing some plastic packaging.

There is a growing problem worldwide of plastic pollution, particularly with single use plastics and our ‘throw-away’ culture – everything from vinegar and shampoo sachets to birthday party goodie-bags and drinking straws; we use them once for perhaps thirty seconds and it can take half a millennium to break down. It is the very definition of unsustainable.

The damage to our oceans is potentially catastrophic with some estimates warning that we could have more plastic than fish in our oceans by the middle of this century. And scientists have yet to confirm what exactly plastic pollution is doing to our food chain and the potential long-term risks to human health.

The recent introduction of the Deposit & Return Scheme can have a positive effect, if the many problems currently undermining the project are solved, but more action is needed.

There is an urgent need to reduce the demand for and supply of plastics, and we commit to the following measures:

– The Social Democrats welcome and support EU initiatives on this issue. However, a 2030 target for the achievement of some of the objectives around plastics is not ambitious enough and we believe Ireland should go much further much sooner.

As an interim measure, we are seeking a levy on plastics that cannot be easily recycled in Ireland at the moment.

– In tandem with this, local authorities should take a pro-active approach to ensure the development of further recycling facilities so that a wider range of material (for instance black

plastics and some soft plastics) is recyclable right across the country.

– We support a ban on all unnecessary single-use plastics such as takeaway coffee cups, knives and forks, and other items, and will seek to put an end to single-use plastic at council events.

– We will promote the development of re-fill options in retail to minimise the production of plastic containers and we will encourage more local authorities to provide refill water dispensers and drinking fountains so that the demand for plastic bottles is reduced.

Protecting Biodiversity

There is growing concern worldwide about the impact of human development on the biodiversity of our planet. Depletion of wildlife and insect loss have become very significant environmental issues.

The Social Democrats will ensure that each of our Councils take biodiversity seriously. We will promote a concept we call Green Communities, whereby Councils would promote biodiversity as much as possible within a given zone.

Under our proposals, the Council would prioritise measures such as:

– Recruiting biodiversity officers and ecology officers in the Councils on which we are represented.

– The planting of trees and flowers in existing and new developments, and on streets.

– Significantly reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides in public green spaces and, where possible, in gardens.

– Advocating for local authorities to cease the use of glyphosate in public open spaces.

– Creating native Woodland Walks and Wildflower Meadows in existing and new parks.

– Increasing the presence of bins, and reducing litter to keep parks, waterways and beaches clean.

– Pursuing blue flag status for beaches in our coastal communities.

– Creating wild picnic bench spots in developments and near offices and encouraging the creation of rooftop gardens in offices and apartments.

– Developing a national hedgerow conservation strategy so that a correct balance can be struck between the interests of landowners, road users, and the habitats of our native wildlife.

More Affordable and Sustainable Energy

Ensuring energy affordability for homes and businesses is important to mitigate deprivation and fuel poverty, and to improve economic competitiveness.

Fuel poverty is often defined as where a household spends more than 10 per cent of income heating their home, but more broadly might be viewed as a situation where households cannot afford to keep the home adequately heated.

The Social Democrats believe that Ireland can do much more to promote affordable and sustainable energy and that local authorities can be significant players in this.

Too often, the debate on energy pits environmental sustainability against affordability. Sustainability and affordability should be dealt with side by side. Climate change is happening, and the role of carbon is undeniable. Equally, energy poverty is a real thing and unless the most vulnerable in our society can access affordable energy, we are undermining public support for the fight against climate change and creating another problem for ourselves.

The Social Democrats believe that energy policy should be based on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals set us the objective of tackling climate change and preventing poverty at the same time. In that vein, we believe local authorities can play a very significant role in promoting a new community-focus on energy policy.

Solar Energy

Individual households and homes can be made more resilient to energy price and supply shocks through the rollout of solar panels.

Though solar installation on private dwellings, public and community owned buildings, and commercial premises has risen significantly, the lack of coordination is inhibiting the scale of nationwide installation. Greater efficiency through economies of scale must be created. Installing panels and completing retrofits almost at random slows down installation and drives up costs. This is where local authorities can have a role.

The Social Democrats want to install solar panels on 100,000 homes each year as part of a sustained state-led effort to harness the power-generating capability of the technology.

Around one million homes in Ireland are suitable for solar panels but do not have them installed. We will provide grants to households to install solar panels, reducing household emissions and cutting electricity bills by an average of up to 40 per cent over the course of a year.

The initial tranche should be targeted at low-income households, using the same eligibility conditions as for the Warmer Homes Scheme.

We will take the following actions:

Solar Panel Installation Strategy

We want to install solar panels on 100,000 homes per year as part of a sustained state-led effort to harness the powergenerating capability of the technology.

In Government, we would create an initial €200m fund to provide grants to households to install solar panels, reducing household emissions and cutting electricity bills.

The Role of Local Authorities

We would examine the possibility for local authorities to bulk-buy these solar panels to allow households to avail of further economies of scale. A standardised approach has the potential to cut costs by up to half.

Installing panels and completing retrofits almost at random slows down installation and drives up costs. Having installers in one area, doing multiple installations and retrofits is far more beneficial. Coordination between local authorities, energy agencies, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), and

Sustainable Energy Communities is necessary. We would have local authorities and local energy agencies create a register of approved PV installers, allied with government grant funding, so they can efficiently manage PV installation at scale in council-owned private dwellings.

Solar Meitheals

Though the Government have invested heavily in the creation of voluntary-run Sustainable Energy Communities (SECs) across the country, once operational the effectiveness of these SECs has been limited. We will lobby for enhanced funding of local authorities and their associated energy agencies so they can support interested Sustainable Energy Communities (SECs) to become Solar Meitheals.

These Meitheals can then utilise their local authority’s register of approved PV installers to create groups of homeowners, community organisations and/or small businesses who want to complete PV installations, thus achieving scale, efficiencies and saving.

Retrofitting Over recent years, the number of homes that have received a ‘deep retrofit’ has increased significantly but the Government is still well behind on its targets. The retrofitting and better insulation of homes, specifically through a ‘deep retrofit’, offer homeowners the opportunity to make significant energy and financial savings, while improving the quality of their living environment.

We will take the following actions:

Support for Local Authorities

We want to see local authorities, the SEAI, and energy agencies develop a list of building contractors under the coordination of One-Stop Shops to tender for block retrofits. This action should be supported by all Councillors, with funding provided at a national level.

Retrofitting Council Housing

Local authorities and energy agencies should identify council-owned housing estates, with building fabric that lends

itself to a ‘deep retrofit’, and work with interested local SECs to create block applications for ‘deep retrofits’ in areas of geographic concentration.

Retrofits in the Wider Community

Once these council-home retrofits are completed, local authorities and energy agencies should also identify housing estates that are ripe for ‘deep retrofit’, and to work with local SECs to create block applications amongst homeowners for deep retrofits.

Community Ownership of Energy The benefits for individuals from the roll-out of renewable energy need not be limited to solar panels on roof tops. There can also be significant benefits at a community level from the shared ownership of other energy projects. Local populations can retain wealth in their local area through the community ownership of projects like windfarms. Such ownership has been shown to also increase local support for such projects.

There is now a clear pathway to allow communities, primarily through the Sustainable Energy Community (SEC) model, to own and generate their own renewable energy, the revenues of which will return to the community, reinforcing community support for decarbonisation. Despite this, the Government is far off its 500MW target to be produced by community-owned renewable schemes.

Currently SECs undertaking this process can receive funding from the SEAI. However, the process for the release of this funding is far too cumbersome. To remedy this, the Social Democrats would introduce two new measures:

– Increased funding to local authorities and their relevant energy agencies, to provide greater technical, financial and business planning expertise to SECs undertaking this process, as well as funding to provide long-term nocost loans to help SECs through this process.

– Provide government-backed low-interest green-loans to SECs in the construction of these renewable energy projects. Given the high cost of construction of Community Owned Renewable Farms, it is imperative that the Government extends financial supports to these schemes. It is not enough to solely rely on European Investment Funds. Ireland has a Strategic Investment Fund that already identifies 'climate' as one of its main impact themes, and the Social Democrats would extend the ability for Community Groups to access government low-interest green loans.

The Social Democrats have a target at least 20 per cent of our new renewable energy generation to be community-owned by 2030, providing direct funding to assist capacity building and technical expertise.

Our Councillors will also work to ensure that all new housing developments include facilities for microgeneration and storage that enables maximum retention of energy produced, allowing households to reduce energy costs and generate income. Bodies such as the Tipperary Energy Agency have shown the enormously positive impact communities can have. We will work to emulate this right across the country.

Supporting Wind Energy

Ireland’s renewable energy resources represent an enormous opportunity for the country.

If we adequately invest in our renewable energy capabilities, Ireland can become a net exporter of clean energy by the end of the decade, while reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels, enhancing our energy security, and reducing vulnerability to international price fluctuations.

Investing in green energy will also be crucial in mitigating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with our international commitments. At a local level, renewable energy will also create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

It is important that the State and state bodies like local authorities can benefit from involvement in this strategically important and potentially lucrative sector of the economy. In many counties, wind farms are already the biggest commercial rates payers to the local council.

Our Councillors will be strong advocates for wind, solar and other renewable energy creation on the local authorities on which they serve, and will promote the benefits and opportunities to constituents. This will allow us to build a more resilient, sustainable and prosperous future for communities and for the country.

There needs to be better alignment of county development plans with national policies on climate action and renewable energy. An audit should be carried out as a priority to assess where gaps exist. We also need to resource our planning system properly (hiring more planners and ecologists) to help assess renewable energy projects.

The easiest wind farm to ‘operationalise’ is the one that is already built and operating. Permission for existing wind farms in county development plans should be extended where the farm has reached ‘end of life’ and the operator is seeking ‘re-powering’, unless there are very good reasons not to.

Delivering Improved Public Transport

Traffic is choking our cities, towns and villages. Meanwhile, too many Irish communities have no transport option but the car. Ireland has one of the highest rates of car usage in Europe.

This didn’t happen by accident. It is the result of a longstanding neglect of public transport investment.

Under successive governments, one abandoned or delayed public transport plan has followed another. Our inability as a country to adopt long-term plans and implement them comes back to haunt us repeatedly.

The Social Democrats are committed to significant investment in both urban and rural public transport. Prioritisation of public transport and cycling over roads expenditure simply has to happen to reduce carbon emissions from the transport sector. The planning of these things is also important for building homes and sustainable communities.

In this Manifesto we are setting out a clear commitment that Social Democrats Councillors will campaign strongly on behalf of their communities for significant improvements in local public transport. We will use every power available to local Councillors to facilitate the expansion of public transport services in our communities.

We are committed to:

Directly Elected Mayor

We are committed to campaigning in favour of directly-elected mayors for Cork, Dublin, Galway, Waterford, and for all local authorities who want them (see Page 62).

We strongly believe that these mayors should assume responsibility for transport planning in each of these cities and counties, creating strong linkages with satellite counties, towns, and communities.

High Planning Standards

We will put transport planning at the heart of all significant housing plans.

We must end the practice of building homes before we build the infrastructure that new communities will depend on.

We will ensure that the needs and opinions of people with disabilities are heard and responded to, and that universal accessibility is central to all transport decisions affecting our Council areas.

It will be our aim to ensure that public and active travel transport services are

affordable, disability-inclusive, and childand elderly-friendly. This will involve access and appropriate space for wheelchairs, and other mobility supports.

It also means that streets, footpaths and cycle lanes should be designed to ensure that children, older people and disabled people can move about safely.

Better Bus Services

Our Councillors will work for an increased prevalence of town buses across all local authority areas.

We must also increase the prevalence of bus shelters, which make a significant difference to people’s enthusiasm about using public transport.

We are committed to working with local public transport service providers to promote the use of predictive analytics to determine if extra service provision is needed during adverse weather conditions and major public events such as festivals, concerts and sporting events).

We will aim to introduce more night bus services, a move that will help to support the food, beverage and hospitality industry, and night life, around the country.

At a national level, we will continue to campaign for lower fares so that the use of public transport is encouraged and congestion is reduced.

Engaging All Stakeholders

We will ensure that Council officials are responsive to local traffic concerns and that requests for roads repairs, traffic lights, pedestrian lights, filter lights, yellow boxes, bollards, ramps and all aspects of traffic management and roads maintenance are dealt with promptly and efficiently.

We will promote active travel to schools and ensuring that all local authorities prioritise the provision of safe walking and cycling paths around every school in the country, so that those children who choose to walk, scoot or cycle to school can do so safely.

Our Councillors will ensure that public transport service providers play a full role in Council Transport policy meetings.

We will establish good accountability arrangements at these meetings so that Councillors can raise service issues for constituents.

We will further ensure that the National Transport Authority is more responsive to meeting requests from local authorities.

Finally, we will ensure that the public know about every significant transport and traffic proposal related to their community and that their voice is heard in the decision-making process.

Promoting Cycling

Ireland is far behind much of Europe in the development of cycling infrastructure. While recent years have seen improvements, many are yet to recognise that cycling is a major transport area that can contribute hugely to society.

The benefits of cycling are enormous. And everyone, even those who don’t cycle, stands to gain. With more cycling we get:

– Less pollution, less congestion, and less carbon emissions. – Healthier lifestyles and a more active population.

– Better mobility and quicker commuting times.

– Safer streets and more liveable neighbourhoods.

Cycling saves time, saves money, and saves lives.

Our local Councillors will help put cycling at the heart of the thinking and strategy of each local authority on which we are represented. Cycling should be recognised as a core element of transport policy and Social Democrats Councillors will make this happen.

We will support the development of comprehensive segregated cycle-lane networks across each local authority area and work to improve connectivity and permeability between and within communities.

Our commitments to cycling include:

– Significantly improved funding for cycling infrastructure. – Proper segregation for safer cycling.

– More cycling greenways and urban bike schemes. – Safer Cycling to School.

– At national level, improved access to the Bike to Work scheme.

The Social Democrats are committed to the following measures:

Increased Funding for Cycling

At a national level, we are committed to maintaining the recent increase of cycling funding to 10 per cent of the Land Transport Budget and in the medium term, increasing funding so that 20 per cent of the Transport Capital Budget is spent on cycling and walking.

Both current and capital funding are critical to the expansion of cycling.

Proper Segregation for Safe Cycling

The first priority of extra funding for cycling should be the implementation of the Cycle Connects Network and the GDA Cycle Network Plan so that cyclists are as safe as possible.

We are committed to planning for sustained improvements in the years ahead so that everyone can feel safe when cycling.

As a general rule, if the cycle network does not adhere to the Hierarchy of Road Users, then it fails to meet the required standard.

In the interim and where cycle lanes can’t be segregated, we favour the programming of traffic lights so that cyclists can get a head start.

We would examine the possible reduction of local road speeds to 30kph, a speed which greatly reduces the chance of fatality in an incident compared to, for example, 60kph.

We favour greater use of segregated contra flow cycle lanes.

Improved Cycling Infrastructure

We will invest in bicycle parking infrastructure, particularly at transport hubs.

We will increase the bike storage capacity on our public transport rolling stock as it is updated, to ensure that cyclists can bring bikes on buses and trains to facilitate more bike commuting from suburbs and across the country. Where possible, the costs to such commuters for this service should be minimised or removed completely.

We will increase funding for the maintenance of cycle lanes at a local level.

We will improve road designs so that roundabouts are less hazardous, so that hostile junctions are redesigned and manhole covers, drains and other potential hazards are appropriately positioned.

We will ensure that all road upgrades and new roads comply with best practice road safety standards and the Hierarchy of Road Users is respected.

At the local Council level, we will ensure that Cycle Connects and the GDA Cycle Network plan are prioritised as part of each local authority’s development plan process.

We will further ensure that cycling is a central provision in each Local Area Plan, Strategic Development Zone and Master Development plan for individual sites. It is our aim to increase transport connectivity between modes of transport by funding more Bike and Ride facilities adjacent to large towns and cities.

Cycling Greenways

We welcome the publication and roll out of the Code of Best - Practice National and Regional Greenways.

We are committed to investing heavily in additional greenways and cycling routes to further promote cycling as a family-friendly pursuit and as a means of encouraging people of all ages and abilities to get on their bikes and make cycling a way of life.

This should also help boost tourism and local economies in the areas where Greenways are built. We are delighted to see the success of some existing routes however, we believe existing greenways could be better marketed than at present, and better route information on issues such as gradient, rest points, unsegregated sections etc could boost participation even further.

We must challenge the culture of objections to such developments, particularly where these objections appear to emanate from a desire for personal convenience, the continuation of carcentric culture, or financial gain.

Safer School Trips

Every child should have a safe route to school. We will continue to promote cycling as the optimum mode of transport for children travelling to school.

We will work to provide safe walking and cycling paths around every school in the country, so that those children who choose to walk, scoot or cycle to school can do so safely.

We will continue to support the cycle bus initiative, such as the highly successful

Galway Cycle Bus, and seek to emulate it right across the country. Funding should be prioritised for community initiatives such as these that promote active travel to schools.

Local Cycling Officers

We will ensure that each local Council is covered by at least one cycling officer to help promote, educate and progress cycling initiatives at local level.

Our Councillors will also lobby so that the filling of any vacancies of pedestrian and cycling officers are prioritised within the Council’s recruitment process.

Cycling Incentive Schemes

At a national level, we want to make the Bike to Work Scheme more inclusive with a complementary grant scheme focusing on those outside the workforce, with specific supports for people with disabilities to adapt bikes to their use.

We would improve the Bike to Work Scheme rate to €1,500 and look to expand this scheme to better support electric and cargo bikes.

We will also review the scheme to examine how it could support the self-employed and those not currently in the tax net.

We believe the definition of ‘eligible equipment’ under the Bike to Work Scheme should be expanded to include child seats and trailers designed to safely carry children.

At local level, we will aim to create a bike library in each local authority, lending ebikes and cargo bikes for up to one month. This could be managed as part of Active Travel teams in county and city councils.

Strong Local Economies

Councils can contribute hugely to the economic success of their areas by promoting and facilitating strong partnerships with the local business community, and by setting the right conditions for business.

Each Council must be cognisant of the key drivers of economic development in their area, the key industries at the heart of this, and adopt strategies to protect and enhance these sectors. Our Councillors are committed to the following measures:

Working with Local Business

We will work with the business community to facilitate and sustain jobs-rich enterprise opportunities and to promote economic development.

We will champion local businesses that not only drive economic growth but also pledge to uphold exemplary labour standards, ensuring each job created is a step toward fair employment.

We will also ensure that sustainable economic development, job creation, and job sustainment are key goals of the development plan in every Council we are represented on.

Procurement

We will insist on fair and transparent public procurement processes at local authority level, and work to give stronger weighting in procurement competitions to bids from suppliers with strong credentials around labour rights, quality local employment, environmental protection, and local social benefit or value.

We will also seek to create a more inclusive and accessible tender process so that a wider range of organisations can successfully bid for contracts, for example smaller local firms or local social enterprises.

Training

We will put a greater focus on enterprise training, through the Local Employment Offices (LEOs) and other state agencies, and on new strategies that aim to maximise the participation of those currently excluded from the workforce.

Where appropriate, we will conduct local skills censuses and develop complementary training programmes which address local skill gaps.

Rejuvenating Main Street

We will prioritise the rejuvenation of our Main Streets to encourage greater footfall, discourage vacancy, improve vibrancy, and make them places where people want to regularly shop, visit, socialise, and live.

(See section on Rejuvenating our Town Centres).

Tourism

We will prioritise tourism and heritage and believe our Councils can contribute significantly to better offerings on these across a number of their competencies.

These offerings include: planning and development, planning enforcement, signage, promotion, litter control, beach

and parks maintenance, and in the expansion of festivals, cultural events, and greenways.

We will Introduce more night bus services, a move that will help to support the food, beverage and hospitality industry, and night life, around the country.

Commercial Rates

We will ensure that the rates regime is fair and transparent and promotes competitiveness.

We will seek to raise collection rates so that local authorities have more revenue and so that compliant businesses are not competing against non-payers. We will use some of this extra funding to lower rates where possible and appropriate.

We will ensure that adequate rates rebate schemes are in place for businesses facing genuine trading difficulties and for startups, as long as such a scheme does not distort competition between competing outlets.

Markets

We want to support town and village markets so that small food producers and co-ops have a space to trade in our communities and people can buy local produce and support local producers.

Insurance Costs

Nationally, we are very concerned about the failure of Government to tackle the high cost of public liability insurance faced by many businesses, but particularly those with high footfall.

Our representatives will strongly push this issue on behalf of local businesses until the excessive court awards for minor injuries

(which is at the heart of our very high insurance costs for public liability) are more in line with international norms.

We also need to see far more action by the Government and regulators to promote sustainable competition in the insurance market – the current competition model has failed.

Community Hubs

We will promote the development of Community Hubs which would provide hot-desks, co-working facilities, hi-speed broadband, and conference and meeting spaces to local businesses and remote workers.

Promoting Community Banking

It is a long-standing aim of the Social Democrats to support the provision of community banking across Ireland.

This would improve the availability of credit in local communities using Credit Unions and Post Offices. The retention of our existing post office network is extremely important.

It would provide far better competition in lending to small businesses and in basic banking fees.

Keeping post offices and credit unions viable would also animate town and village centres and increase footfall for local businesses.

Community Wealth Building

The work of our Councillors will be informed by the principles of Community Wealth Building (see next section on same), so that the amount of wealth extracted from the local community is limited, and more income and spending is recirculated within the local area.

Community Wealth Building

Community Wealth Building is an approach to local economic development where local economies are reorganised so that the amount of wealth extracted from the local community is limited, and more income and spending is recirculated within the local area.

These ideas are being applied by a growing number of businesses and municipalities across the UK and USA, driving a shift in thinking around economic development.

Community Wealth Building (CWB):

– Recognises the benefits of a diverse blend of ownership models, which can return more economic power to local people and institutions.

For example, small enterprises, community organisations, cooperatives and many forms of municipal ownership are often more economically beneficial for the local economy than large or public limited companies.

Community ownership of energy sources is another way in which different ownership models can bring benefits to the locality.

– Seeks to increase flows of investment within local economies.

The aim is to harness wealth that exists locally, for example by maximising local community benefits through procurement and commissioning policies.

Progressive procurement can develop more local supply chains, with benefits for local SMEs, social enterprises, cooperatives, and other forms of community business that are more likely to support local employment and retain wealth and spending locally.

CWB can be particularly useful (even crucial) in areas where the economy has been hollowed out through years of under-investment.

It has the potential to re-direct millions of euros back into the local economy, leading to a reduction in unemployment and increased wealth in the area.

All communities, cities and counties are unique, and so there can be no one-size fits all model of CWB. It makes sense if elected Councillors in each area work together to develop local models of CWB based on local characteristics.

The Social Democrats are committed to the following actions and principles around Community Wealth Building:

Procurement

We will insist on fair and transparent public procurement processes at local authority level, and work to give stronger weighting in procurement competitions to bids from suppliers with strong credentials around labour rights, quality local employment, environmental protection, and local social benefit or value.

We will also seek to create a more inclusive and accessible tender process so that a wider range of organisations can successfully bid for contracts, for example smaller local firms or local social enterprises.

Using a wider range of criteria beyond cost alone can be used as part of the procurement processes and can help contribute to virtuous local supply chains.

We will develop a Social Value Procurement Framework to encourage suppliers to promote local training and employment, support the local community and community sector, and promote environmental sustainability.

Community Energy Schemes

There can be significant benefits at a community level from the shared ownership of energy projects. Local populations can retain wealth in their local area through the community ownership of projects like windfarms and solar farms.

Such ownership has been shown to also increase local support for such projects.

There is now a clear pathway to allow communities, primarily through the Sustainable Energy Community (SEC) model, to own and generate their own renewable energy, the revenues of which

will return to the community, reinforcing community support for decarbonisation.

Despite this, the Government is far off its 500MW target to be produced by community-owned renewable schemes.

The Social Democrats have a target at least 20 per cent of our new renewable energy generation to be community-owned by 2030, providing direct funding to assist capacity building and technical expertise.

(See section on Developing Sustainable Energy, Page 36).

Social Enterprise

Social enterprises blend entrepreneurial spirit and activity with a social mission, with the goal of addressing issues including local, unemployment, social exclusion, or environmental sustainability at a local level.

Properly funded and supported, they have the potential to play a significant role in building resilient communities.

Our Councillors will advocate for access to Local Enterprise Office business supports that enhance the skills and capabilities of social enterprise leaders and workers.

They also will ensure that local Social Value Procurement Frameworks (see the Procurement section, previously) facilitate local authority procurement from social enterprises in a way that supports local jobs and other community benefits.

Where possible, our Councillors will work for increased local financial support to encourage the growth and sustainability of social enterprises, and foster an environment where Social Enterprises and Cooperatives can thrive.

Promoting Community Banking

As noted in the previous section, it is a long-standing aim of the Social Democrats to support the provision of community banking across Ireland.

This would improve the availability of credit in local communities using Credit Unions and Post Offices.

It would provide far better competition in lending to small businesses and in basic banking fees.

Keeping post offices and credit unions viable would also animate town and village centres and increase footfall for local businesses.

CWB within the wider Community

Our Councillors will work with local Anchor Institutions so that they are aware of the concept of Community Wealth Building, what it can achieve, and how to implement policies and processes that support it.

The term ‘anchor institution’ is used to refer to organisations which have an important presence in a place, usually by

virtue of being large scale employers, large purchasers of goods and services in the locality, or overseeing large areas of land, whilst also having relatively fixed assets.

Anchor institutions are usually tied to a place by their mission, for example hospitals and other health and social care related settings, educational institutions, housing associations, and some large (and longstanding) local businesses and community and voluntary groups.

Tapping into their sense of civic responsibility and their contribution to the local economy – from how they purchase goods and services to their employment policies to their investment and finance strategies – can also further Community Wealth Building.

Guided by Community Wealth Building principles, Anchor Institutions can play a defining role generating local economic benefits.

We will work to mainstream Community Wealth Building in the strategies and policies of local authorities and national government.

Rejuvenating our Town Centres

Our town centres, main streets and neighbourhood shops are often the centrepoints of our neighbourhoods. They are some of the most prominent spaces we share and in which we come together as a community.

Yet, too often in Ireland, they can be the worst kept, worst planned, least loved areas. We have to re-think how we support businesses and enterprises at local level to ensure the vitality of our towns, villages and urban villages.

It is no surprise that towns and villages with a vibrant, bustling core, with well-maintained shops, a diverse range of outlets, attractive streetscapes, a strong traffic plan and good access, are often the places where communities are most active. Thriving, vibrant main streets are central to the sustainability of our towns and villages as places to live and work.

The Social Democrats want to put these shopping areas back at the top of the Councils’ agenda.

We will prioritise rejuvenation of these parts of our towns and villages to:

– stimulate economic development and local job creation. – promote regional economic development.

– protect the interests of main street traders and give a leg-up to small businesses, innovators and entrepreneurs.

We must encourage the re-population of our town centres, while also encouraging community, sporting and arts groups to use our main streets in practical and innovative ways.

Alongside our other plans for strengthened local government and stronger communities, we are making the following proposals to boost support to our main streets and neighbourhood shops, and to rejuvenate our town centres.

We commit to the following:

Promoting Development

Regional

Economic

We should be using the National Development Plan to invest in projects that boost industrial and commercial capacity across the country such as improved rural broadband, public transport, electricity capacity, and third level technological centres.

This will improve local economies and employment opportunities, boosting purchasing power and retail possibilities across the country, and help provide economic counterweights to Dublin and the eastern seaboard.

Rates Rebates as a Policy Lever

Owners of vacant commercial premises can often claim a refund on commercial rates from their local authority.

This can encourage the proliferation of shuttered, empty and under-used premises on many of our Main Streets.

No rebates should be available for premises that remain vacant after a reasonable period is allowed for re-letting or re-use, to be set by each local authority.

Social Democrats Councillors will work with interested tenants and landlords to ensure that, where possible, vacant commercial premises can be used for ‘Meanwhile Use’ for things like pop-up galleries and other types of creative spaces, as well as office spaces for local start-ups. (See next page for more info).

Our Councillors will ensure that adequate rebate schemes are in place for community facilities, businesses facing genuine trading difficulties and for those that need assistance in the start-up phase – subject to a provision that such a scheme

would not distort competition between neighbouring outlets.

Improving Local Authority Funding

Central funding of local authorities must be improved to allow adjustment of commercial rates and street-parking rates to promote the commercial viability of Main Street businesses.

Funding should also be provided for environmental improvement works such as street lighting, footpaths, parking, cycling infrastructure, accessibility for wheelchairs and buggies, landscaping, and street furniture.

Planning and investing in things like better lighting in urban areas, and places for nature within our urban settings, are key to making people choose to spend more time in our towns and villages.

As noted earlier, we would also like to see seed funding provided to local authorities to help improve the collection of commercial rates and apply at least some of these savings to help lower rates overall.

Town and Village Regeneration

The Town and Village Scheme currently provides funding to help rejuvenate local communities. However, many urban pockets in need of such funding cannot currently qualify. This scheme needs to be better funded and expanded to allow urban villages to benefit.

In addition, we would ensure that the shop-front improvement grant scheme is enhanced and available to all towns and villages.

Each of our Councillors will push for a specific budget for ‘neighbourhood shops’ in their area to improve the appearance of these key focal points in communities and

to make such shops more accessible for people with disabilities, cyclists, and pedestrians.

We will support our communities in making bids under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.

Strict Enforcement of Out-of-Town Shopping Centre Guidelines

A strong set of planning guidelines exists to protect Main Streets and town centres when planning applications for out-of-town shopping centres are being considered.

However, these have not always been well observed or applied by planning authorities.

We are in favour of setting the planning regulator with the task of ensuring that planning authorities strictly enforce planning guidelines so that town centres are not adversely affected by new developments.

Tackling Vacant and Derelict Sites

The law needs to change to give stronger powers to local authorities to tackle vacant and derelict sites and shops.

The Vacant Site Levy failed in large part due to the fact that a huge number of local authorities failed to engage with the terms of the Levy. At one point, three years after the implementation of the Levy, nearly half of all local authorities had no sites listed, and most had no market value available.

We will ensure that our Councils properly engage with the legislation governing the Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT), which replaced the Vacant Site Levy.

Such measures would minimise dereliction, counter land-hoarding, and

help end the under-use of town centre sites.

We also favour the strengthening of the role of local authority staff, such as Public Domain Officers, to intervene with businesses who fail to maintain their premises to an acceptable standard at the expense of neighbouring businesses.

Meanwhile Use

Commercial vacancy is a growing problem in many of our cities, towns and villages.

‘Meanwhile Use’ allows for a tenant to temporarily occupy vacant or underused premises, sites or spaces in urban areas.

‘Meanwhile Use’ is typically pursued while a landlord secures a new long-term lease, before the major redevelopment of a site, or in a long-term vacant space. It benefits the community, the landlord and the temporary tenant, including by:

– Reinvigorating main streets.

– Providing short-term security income for landlords.

and

– Supporting local SMEs and start-ups by creating new flexible, affordable workspace and creative spaces, and

– Providing potential spaces to creative, artistic or cultural groups in a town.

Meanwhile Use Leases are agreements between the local authority, the landlord, and the tenant.

Social Democrats Councillors will work with interested tenants and landlords to ensure that, where possible, vacant commercial premises can be used for things like pop-up galleries and other types of creative spaces, as well as office spaces for local start-ups.

Repopulation of Main Streets

We will promote the repopulation of urban centres by encouraging over-the-shop conversion to residential.

The Buy and Renew Scheme allows local authorities to purchase and renovate housing units in need of repair, before making them available for social housing. Too many local authorities have, in our opinion, been too slow to utilise this funding, despite the additional benefit of tackling dereliction and improving streetscape appearance.

The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund assists with compact and sustainable development, and facilitates a greater proportion of residential development within the existing built-up areas.

Again, this has the added benefit of ensuring more parts of our urban areas become attractive and vibrant places in which to live, work, visit and invest.

The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund aims to address building vacancy through refurbishment and redevelopment, or demolition where necessary, while the Town and Village scheme includes funding for tackling vacancy and dereliction, and an option for local authorities to acquire land for town regeneration.

Town Website & Local Branding

We will promote the development of town websites and social media presence with listings of all shops, services, contacts, events, promotions, opening times etc.

We will also push for funding for the development of local branding, such as a county flag or other regional branding, to support indigenous producers and local independent shops.

Parking Management

Several local authority areas, particularly in cities, are experiencing problems with parking management, having outsourced the area. Simply put, parking enforcement often does not happen at all away from the very centres of the cities or towns in question.

In areas where this is the case, our Councillors will seek specific resources for each administrative area to be outlined in the outsourcing contract so that there is a fairer spread of parking wardens across the local authority and the division of resources is not solely dictated by which areas are considered ‘lucrative’.

Community Hubs

We will promote the development of Community Hubs which would provide hot-desks, co-working facilities, hi-speed broadband and conference and meeting spaces to local businesses and remote workers.

These could be provided in under-used or disused buildings or as a section of a local library or Council office. The more we can promote a community-centred approach, the greater vibrancy and economic sustainability in our local communities.

End Upward Only Rent Reviews

Rents are a key part of the cost-base for main street businesses and are a major factor in the viability of many independently-owned shops.

Upward-only rents can undermine businesses because their sheer inflexibility does not take account of the ups and downs of the business cycle. We will seek to amend the Constitution to ensure that legislation can be enacted banning upward only rent reviews.

Safer Communities

The Social Democrats are committed to fostering safer, more vibrant communities across Ireland.

Crime Prevention Through Design

Recognising the profound impact that the built environment has on crime rates and community well-being, our Councillors will advocate for the integration of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles into all aspects of urban planning and development. CPTED strategies not only deter criminal activity but also enhance the quality of life for all residents, embodying our vision for inclusive, secure, and cohesive communities.

CPTED is based on the premise that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in the incidence and fear of crime.

Core CPTED principles include increased visibility in public spaces to encourage positive social interaction among residents and create environments where potential offenders feel exposed; ensuring urban environments are well-maintained and free of the signs of neglect, which can signal to potential offenders that crime is tolerated; using design to express ownership over spaces, encouraging residents to take stewardship of their community areas and deter unauthorised access; and promoting the use of public spaces for safe, intended purposes.

Our Councillors commit to:

– Championing CPTED principles, integrating them into all urban planning and community development initiatives within their local councils.

– Increasing Public Awareness by leading public awareness campaigns to educate residents on the role of environmental design in crime prevention.

– Advocating for legislation and policies that mandate the consideration of CPTED principles in all new developments and major refurbishments.

– Initiating and supporting platforms for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between residents, community groups, urban planners, and the gardaí.

Better Policing

We believe policing in our community could work so much better if there was greater co-operation and consultation with communities and local Councillors.

The Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) and especially Community Safety/Policing Forums around the country are good models. They bring together Gardaí, senior Council officials and communities to discuss crime and anti-social activity in the local area. They have been a welcome improvement on making local Gardaí accountable and a good way of exchanging information on local issues. However, we are not maximising output from them.

Their effectiveness depends far too much on how active individual residents, Gardaí and Council staff are in the given area. Far too few people know about them, how they can interact with them, or how to have an issue raised and responded to. There are often unnecessary restrictions Councillors questions to them. And the remit of the JPCs is currently too restricted.

The Social Democrats wish to reform the JPCs so they have a more formal role in setting local policing plans. All elected Councillors should be able to pose a limited number of questions at their local JPC and/or Community Safety/Policing Forum. Gardaí should be required to provide information well in advance of meetings to allow for the smooth operation of JPCs. Contact details for the public and minutes of meetings should be easily available on each local authority’s website and in public libraries.

All Social Democrats Councillors will actively engage with their JPCs and Community Safety/Policing Forums to represent crime and safety issues arising in their areas and ensure that their communities are well informed as to how the Council and local Gardaí are responding. We will also work to further improve co-operation between JPCs and drugs task forces.

Separate from JPCs, we will promote “passive policing”, and ensure that public parks and public places are well lit and safe. On a national level, the Social Democrats will continue to seek the restoration of community Gardaí staffing levels. A greater prevalence of gardaí on bicycles patrolling an area has the double benefit of allowing them to move quickly and be seen by the community.

We support the establishment of at least one dedicated Women’s Refuge for victims of domestic violence in every county, and the full meeting of Ireland’s obligations under the Istanbul Convention.

Fair Funding for Local Authorities

There are four main income sources for local authorities.

These comprise of:

– Local Property Tax Receipts (collected from local homeowners but distributed from a central fund).

– Commercial Rates (collected from local businesses).

– Grants from central government (mainly from the departments of Housing & Local Government, Transport, and Communications).

– Charges on Goods and Services provided by local authorities.

Under this system, local authorities depend very heavily on central government to fund basic service provision. However, the Social Democrats are not satisfied that the current system is sufficiently evidence-based, as there is a wide variation in how counties and cities benefit.

In particular, population size, population changes, staff ratios, and infrastructure deficits are not adequately factored into how grants and the proceeds of the Local Property Tax are distributed to local authorities.

Local Property Tax

There are a number of key problems with how the funding raised through the Local Property Tax (LPT) is distributed.

The first issue is that the LPT has not boosted Council funding.

The introduction of the LPT was supposed to ensure that funding to local authorities could be stabilised and improved and, in turn, used to improve local services. This simply hasn’t happened.

The financial position of local authorities has not significantly improved since before the LPT was introduced. What gains the LPT did initially provide to local authorities was taken away by the withdrawal of Motor Tax funding and, in many cases, a reduction in central government grants in roads and housing. Individuals and communities rightly ask “what am I getting for my Local Property Tax?” and the answer is often “not a whole lot more”.

Another problem is that the allocation of the LPT to our local Councils is not evidence-based.

There is a severe disadvantage to Councils that have experienced significant population growth since the “baselines” were set. Each Council’s baseline has not been properly updated since the early 2000s, so in many cases no longer reflects the true financial needs of Councils.

This results in a transfer that particularly advantages counties where population growth has not been as rapid, but means that Councils such as Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, Fingal, South Dublin, Galway City, Clare and others lose significant funds. Some of the Councils with the lowest staff-to-population ratios lose the most out of this process because their position is assumed to remain unchanged, when the reality is populations have grown rapidly. It is simply unfair.

The Social Democrats believe that the way the proceeds of the LPT are distributed needs to be overhauled. It firstly needs to factor in population growth and the service and infrastructure needs such growth generates.

The Department of Housing should go back to the drawing board and reestablish each local authorities’ true needs. These needs should be updated regularly to allow for demographic shifts, infrastructure deficits, current staffto-population rations, and other issues that have shifted significantly in the last couple of decades. The LPT should then be distributed on a much fairer basis than is currently the case.

This would mean increased funding for staff, services and infrastructure for those Councils with the biggest population increases in recent years. It would also mean that the Local Property Tax would be a more truly “local” tax, as was the original intention. Our Councillors’ votes on Local Property Tax will be informed by the need to fund local public services and the direct benefit accruing to their specific local authority area from the LPT.

Collection of Commercial Rates

While there have been some welcome improvements in the collection of Local Authority Rates (or Commercial Rates) in recent years, there is still much room for improvement in many areas.

There is a collection rate of 94 per cent for the Local Property Tax. Disappointingly, the average collection rate per local authority in Commercial Rates is only 88 per cent. The most up to date comparative data across local

authorities shows that while Fingal County Council leads the way on 98 per cent, four local authorities have collection rates of less than 80 per cent.

Such a low collection rate means that compliant businesses are doubly disadvantaged. They are paying rates while their competitors are not, and the level of the rate struck is higher than it would be if everyone was paying their fair share. If we want our local Councils to provide all of the basic public services that we rely on, then everyone who can afford to contribute must do so.

The Social Democrats would invest in supports and expertise to assist those poor performing local authorities to boost their collection rates so that these Councils can become more self-sustaining and less reliant on central funding. This would entail reviewing where each authority is falling down and providing them with advice and extra staff to improve rates collection. We also believe there is much scope for peer-learning on this issue.

Several local authorities offer discounts on rates for vacant commercial premises. The Social Democrats believe significant rates discounts for vacant premises encourages the dis-use of shops and is one of the main factors explaining why so many of our Main Streets and Town Centres are empty, rundown or littered with shuttered premises. Indeed, vacant units impact on footfall and impede the commercial interests of neighbouring outlets.

We believe there should be no rebate for premises that remain vacant after a reasonable period, to be set by the Council, is allowed for re-letting or re-use.

We accept this measure will impact differently on different areas depending on the level of economic activity in the area so we would allow local Councillors apply discretion as to how long a unit would have to be vacant in a given area before the discount would no longer apply.

Local Authority Grants

The distribution of Local Authority Grants from central government is also not done on a fair basis. Many of the same local authorities that suffer from the unfairness of how the Local Property Tax operates, for instance Meath and Kildare, are hit with the same unfairness under this grant system.

The Social Democrats are calling for a complete overhaul of how this system operates so that allocations operate on the basis of an objective resource allocation model. Population growth and service deficits should be much more central to the value of grants given out.

Honest and Open Councils

Most Councillors strive to do their best for their communities. Sadly, however, the history of local government in Ireland is littered with malpractice, corruption, backhanders, and abuse of our planning system.

The Social Democrats want to stamp this out once and for all.

A long-standing aim of the Social Democrats is the establishment of an AntiCorruption Agency. Such an agency would be a vital law enforcement tool to help eradicate corrupt practices in politics and business in Ireland. We remain absolutely committed to its establishment.

If we are to build public trust in local democracy, then transparency, accountability, and integrity must be the defining features of local decisionmaking.

There is wide variation in the levels of openness and transparency between different local authorities, including on things like the live online streaming of council meetings, the availability of files and documents, planning archives, and obligations on council staff to answer questions from local representatives.

While there are many good models of practice, others need improvement.

Additional transparency around public sessions of council meetings can only improve accountability of public representatives and increase a feeling of accessibility towards the political system among the general public.

At local level, the Social Democrats are putting honesty and transparency at the heart of what we do as Councillors.

Transparent Local Government

We want to see the live online streaming of council sessions, at all levels.

This is already being done in many local authority areas since the pandemic. Much in the way that Oireachtas TV has improved visibility and accessibility of the national parliament, this would make council meetings more accessible to the

people affected by discussions, and decisions.

the

debates,

Technology should also be used to make meetings more accessible to Councillors who can’t make every meeting. This additional openness and accessibility should be mandated at all levels, from Municipal Council meetings to Regional Assemblies.

Voting records at Council meetings should be made easily available to the public.

The Social Democrats accept all of the recommendations for local authorities made by both the Mahon Tribunal and Transparency Ireland in its report Integrity Index 2018.

Ethics in Public Life

The Social Democrats aim to develop and maintain up-to-date, comprehensive Corruption and Fraud Prevention and Contingency Plans in every local authority on which we serve.

We will ensure there are proper procedures in place for Ethics Registrars. We will also ensure that all consultations are adequately documented and published on the Council’s website.

We also want to see Councillors’ annual declarations of interests published on every local authority website.

Assisting Councillors in Their Work

It has been the experience of many of our party’s Councillors that the documents and reports to be attached to the agenda for

council meetings are often made available too close to the meeting.

When this happens, Councillors often don’t have time to prepare properly. This means that elected representatives cannot properly scrutinise Council affairs.

These documents should be sent out in a timely fashion. Our Councillors will seek to amend the Standing Orders to create rules around this function so that documents are received in a timely fashion.

National Level

At national level, the Social Democrats will continue to highlight the government’s inexcusable foot-dragging when it comes to implementing the ethics reforms recommended by the Mahon Tribunal in 2012.

The Public Sector Standards Bill was introduced to the Oireachtas in 2015 but there was simply no political drive behind it, and it never passed into law.

While aspects of this Bill have been superseded by subsequent Acts, we are determined to have its provisions passed in full.

Direct Democracy at Local Level

Since their inception in 2014, Public Participation Networks (PPNs) have operated in every local authority and are a vital link in bringing the community voice to the local authority policymaking process.

In being made up of local and community groups, PPNs recognise the contribution of volunteer-led organisations to local economic, social, and environmental capital, and the participation of PPNs in the deliberative democracy process facilitates input from these organisations to council policy.

Elected Councillors have a vital role to play in facilitating participation through open consultative processes and active engagement. Social Democrat Councillors will engage constructively with PPNs and local authorities to support communities and allow for member organisations to engage meaningfully on issues of policy that concern them.

Community Budgeting is a type of participatory budgeting scheme that builds on international practice and the award-winning scheme run in South Dublin County Council (SDCC) since 2016. These schemes bring control of some Council funds back to local communities with an opportunity for broad public participation in deciding spending priorities.

Community Budgeting allows local residents and groups to propose ideas for Council spending in their communities using a specially allocated fund. Proposed projects which meet scheme guidelines are shortlisted for public vote.

Councillors and Council management play an important role in establishing and steering the scheme, but should not back particular projects and instead ensure the public have their say.

Elected Social Democrats Councillors will seek the establishment of Community Budgeting schemes in each local authority on which they are represented, along with cross-party Steering Committees with the involvement of both management and Councillors.

The amount to be allocated and the geographic area covered (local electoral area/municipal district/full Council) will depend on the specifics of the local authority in question. The successful €300,000 annual scheme in South Dublin has seen projects as diverse as playgrounds, ball skill walls, orchards and public pianos proposed, voted on by the public, and delivered by SDCC.

Strategic Policy Committees

For elected Councillors, Strategic Policy Committees (SPCs) are a vital mechanism to shape and guide local policymaking in line with community needs and priorities.

These committees, focusing on key sectors like housing, transport, economic development, and the environment, provide a structured process for Councillors to influence policy direction at a local level.

Through their work on SPCs, Councillors can have a direct channel to represent the interests and concerns of their constituents in specific policy areas. This role is fundamental in ensuring that the voice of the community is heard at the policymaking table.

Serving on an SPC also offers Councillors the opportunity to specialise in areas of personal or professional interest. This specialisation can enable them to build a depth of knowledge and expertise, which can elevate the quality of debate and decision-making within the overall council.

SPCs are an opportunity to drive change, influence local governance, and make a lasting impact on the community they serve.

Better Community Engagement

Our Councillors commit to leveraging SPCs as platforms for deeper community engagement, ensuring a broader range of voices are heard in the policymaking process.

This could involve initiatives to increase public awareness of SPC functions, facilitating public submissions on policy proposals, and hosting community forums or workshops to gather input on local issues and priorities.

Improving Transparency

Our Councillors will work to improve transparency around the workings of SPCs, including the publication of meeting minutes, decision-making processes, and

policy development updates in accessible formats.

The goal should be to demystify local governance for constituents.

Evidence-based Policy

Our Councillors will advocate for an increased focus on data and evidence in SPC deliberations and recommendations.

This might involve research, stakeholder consultation, and policy outcomeevaluation to ensure decisions are informed by the best available evidence.

Living Our Values

Our Councillors will ensure that SPCs prioritise policies that support sustainable development and social inclusion, aligning

with the Democrats.

core

values

of

the

Social

This will include pushing policies that promote affordable housing, public transport, environmental conservation, and economic opportunities that are accessible to all community members.

Strengthening SPCs

Our Councillors will propose measures to strengthen the role of SPCs by ensuring they are adequately resourced and have

the authority to make meaningful contributions to policy development.

Better Coordination

Our Councillors will promote better coordination and collaboration among different SPCs to address cross-cutting issues more effectively.

This can lead to more cohesive policy development, avoiding siloed approaches and ensuring that council initiatives are well-integrated and mutually reinforcing.

Directly Elected Mayors

The creation of a directly elected mayoral position in a local authority would help balance the power of the unelected Chief Executive with added democracy.

The Social Democrats welcomed the advent of the directly elected mayor (DEM) for Limerick and believe the further roll-out of this position for other city and county councils is the way forward. However, we acknowledge that plebiscites should decide where they will be created.

We need accountability for people who are making the important decisions, as well as for directors of services, with more oversight coming from the mayor and Councillors. Local authority chief executives have a lot of power, and yet there is no way for voters to remove them if they do not like the job they are doing.

We propose:

– Retaining the Chief Executive role, alongside a DEM for the counties who wish to have it.

– Creating the DEM as a strategic role, leaving the Chief Executive to manage

the operations of the council.

– Giving budgetary oversight powers to the DEM who would assist the Chief Executive in drawing up the annual budget with assistance from the Councillors.

– Giving the DEM responsibility for initial drafts of county development plans and climate action plans, with input from Councillors who must also approve the final version.

– Ultimately awarding DEMs executive responsibilities in each local authority where they exist in areas like housing, planning, waste management, community and traffic policing, and fire services. We are particularly keen to see DEMs take a role in transport policy, with a key role in setting local transport strategies. They would also take the lead on areas such as economic and tourism development, engaging with Gardaí, and creating safer public spaces.

– Personnel and financial resources being transferred as appropriate for the mayoral office to function.

As the DEM is not intended to be solely a figurehead, they should have responsibility for strategy setting and an appropriate level of power to support the functions of the role.

The mayoral position needs significant power for it to be worthwhile. The entire point of having a DEM is that they have a personal mandate, and their decisions should carry weight. If this is not the case, DEMs will represent merely the addition of highly paid lobbyists to a system that already exists.

The envisaged strategic policy role for the mayor will be difficult to realise without greater access to finance and devolved powers. The size of the budget is vital. If the DEM doesn’t have a budget to enact their mandate, no mandate might as well exist.

This does not necessarily have to mean “new money” is given to the areas with a DEM. Instead, money that is already spent in the area, but where the decisionmaking on how to spend it takes place in Dublin, could be devolved to a more local level.

Mayors should set strategy, reliant on engagement with Councillors. Indeed, as many of the executive powers include the right to prepare and propose policies, and Council approval is required to confirm them, the mayor will need to work with the council.

Strengthening Local Government

The advent of Directly Elected Mayors in local authorities would be an important step in improving and enhancing local democracy. However, it will take more than this to have the transformative effect necessary for the potential of local government in Ireland to be fulfilled.

Almost every consequential policy decision in Ireland is made at central government (or ‘national’) level. This overly centralised system of government marks us out as different from our European peers.

At each general election, all political parties make the same statements about local government in Ireland: it’s weak, it’s underfunded, it’s under-resourced. And they all promise to reform it. But outside of promises to conduct a review, few concrete proposals are ever put forward and, after the election, things carry on as before.

The Social Democrats are serious about reforming local government. Indeed, we believe we cannot reform politics in Ireland until we reform local government.

By comparison to our European peers, Ireland has low levels of political representation, as well as a very low level of revenue-raising, expenditure and service delivery at a local level.

Our local authorities have the least autonomy in all of Europe, with a system of ‘local administration’ – rather than local government – that is heavily dependent on central government funding. We also have a relatively low number of local government units. This all must change.

The Social Democrats believe in the principle of subsidiarity, meaning that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or local level that is consistent with their resolution. There are a number of policy areas that could, and indeed should, be dealt with at a more local level than is currently the case in Ireland. This is the way things are done across Europe, particularly in those countries with a history of social democracy.

The extent to which local authorities must, in some circumstances, seek national-level permission to spend money is little short of ridiculous. County and City Councils often cannot hire staff without getting sanction from the Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage; an overly onerous process.

In most areas of the country, public bus routes are managed at national level by Transport For Ireland (TFI). But it stands to reason that TFI has less local knowledge of most counties and towns than councillors elected to represent them. This is the kind of planning that should be devolved to local level.

Local authorities employ planners, architects, quantity surveyors; but too many pieces of work done at local level are micro-managed or even re-done at national level.

The current system leaves the local knowledge in one place, and control of the budget of the other. The Social Democrats believe there are several areas in which local authorities should have more autonomy and control.

– Public transport planning is currently not within the statutory remit of local authorities (though there is an advisory role). This role should be greatly enhanced.

– There should be greater scope for local authorities to raise their own revenue, beyond the current restrictive setup which essentially amounts to local rates, plus a share from the local property tax fund.

– Other areas of policy where there is scope for greater devolvement to a local level include childcare and elder care, arts and culture, tourism, some aspects of economic development, and certain recreational facilities.

– We need to enhance local democracy and widen participation by increasing representation at each local government level; municipal, county, and regional, to better serve our communities.

– We will continue to advocate for the provision of adequate resources to allow local government to fulfil the roles already assigned to it, and to broaden their scope.

"EP 2019: Fianna Fail","Foreword
The story of the EU is one of unprecedented co-operation and success. The Irish part in that history is marked by transformative infrastructural investment, positive social change and rich economic growth. The recent Brexit chapter, characterised by misinformation and dangerously narrow nationalism, cannot be allowed to define the next stage of the EU’s remarkable development. Fianna Fáil firmly believes that Ireland must continue to place itself at the heart of Europe. This means electing a strong EU Parliamentary team that is committed to delivering for Ireland through constructive politics.

We must look beyond the daily turmoil of Brexit to take on the other critical issues that will shape the continent for decades to come. The EU must be at the forefront of global efforts to rise to the challenge of climate change, particularly after the revoking of any responsibility by the current US administration. The swift expansion of Big Tech into more and more areas demands a co-ordinated response that defends consumers and creators alike. We must protect our children as well as our democratic institutions. Within the EU itself, the fraudulent and fake approach of populist parties threatens to unravel decades of progress and co-operation.

The EU must strongly defend its values: the rule of law; institutional independence; and free trade. It must live up to its historic legacy as a social Europe that invests in its citizens, boosts economic opportunities and enshrines equality. It must become a true global leader, drawing on the collective strength of its members states.

The Fianna Fáil European team brings with them a wealth of experience. They are united by a shared commitment to decency, fairness and constructive politics. They know the issues facing our regions from the Common Agricultural Policy to Brexit negotiations and our tax sovereignty. They are committed to working with our ALDE colleagues in Europe to fight our corner and ensure that extremist politics do not hijack the EU. Our team will work to find solutions rather than just resorting to protest politics.

Our European team will ensure that Europe works for you.

Executive Summary
Fianna Fáil is proud of our role in leading Ireland into the EEC in 1973 and the immense contribution that it has made to Irish life. However, Brexit marks an unprecedented blow to the most successful transnational union in the history of the world. The 2016 rejection by British voters of the EU was a deeply disappointing decision that risks immense damage to the UK, Ireland and EU on a whole. Fianna Fáil believes in the EU and believes that Ireland should remain at the heart of it. We need to strengthen and reform the Union to ensure that it is a positive force in the lives of Irish citizens. Fianna Fáil’s candidates are committed to working with our ALDE colleagues in building a reformed EU that delivers for all its 500 million citizens.

Putting Ireland at the heart of Europe

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
• Put Irish citizens at the heart of European decision making
• Embrace the EU Aid Volunteer Initiative
• Expand the free EU Rail Initiative
• Create a fund to promote EU wide sporting competitions at all ability levels
• Strengthen EU Cultural funding
• Enhance EU Twinning Initiatives to encompass secondary schools
• Deepen Oireachtas links with the EU Parliament
• Build on EU wide health initiatives
• Tackle international crime
• Secure the Irish Language’s status in Europe

Joining the EU has been an overwhelming success for Ireland. However, Brexit has underlined how the story of the EU needs to be about more than just economics. We want to build a positive engagement about EU values and our place in Europe that goes beyond markets. Fianna Fáil believes that being Irish and being European are inextricably and positively linked. To help cement Ireland’s place at the centre of the EU we will:

PUT IRISH CITIZENS AT THE HEART OF EUROPEAN DECISION MAKING

We need to ensure that Irish citizens make the most of the job opportunities at the heart of the EU institutions. We have a proud record of public service in the core EU bodies over the past half a century that we should continue to build upon. Fianna Fáil will promote an information campaign in universities about EU job opportunities such as the Stagiaire programme. Secondments from the public service to EU bodies will also be further promoted to build up experience and encourage a crossover of new ideas and expertise.

EMBRACE THE EU AID VOLUNTEER INITIATIVE

The Peace Corp in the USA has been a success in broadening horizons for hundreds of thousands of Americans and fostering

US ideals while adding real value to the mission countries. The EU Aid Initiative has the same potential for EU citizens and values. Ireland should play a leading role in that drawing on our strong tradition of assistance to developing countries. We will promote the EU Aid Initiative in schools, universities and workplaces to drive on Irish participation levels.

EXPAND THE FREE INTERRAIL INITIATIVE

The Interrail pass is a deeply enriching tradition for students across the EU that stretches back decades. It is an immensely positive way to see the continent and meet a wide variety of young people from across the EU. It’s important that as many Irish students as possible have access to this enriching cultural experience. The InterRail pilot program should be expanded and developed to enable more young people to enjoy this special experience. Additional steps should be taken to allow students with a disability to fully access the scheme.

CREATE A FUND TO PROMOTE EU-WIDE SPORTING COMPETITIONS AT ALL ABILITY LEVELS

Sport is a common language that speaks across national boundaries. It strengthens bonds across the EU in a way few other endeavours can. The EU should encourage and actively facilitate sporting competitions at all ability levels across the EU. A new EU fund to support cross-continental sporting competitions that amateur organisations can access should be established. The ERASMUS+ programme should be expanded to facilitate connections among sporting, educational and training organisations across the EU.

STRENGTHEN EU CULTURAL FUNDING

The EU has an important part to play in promoting the arts and culture sphere. Fianna Fáil will support initiatives to boost funding for cultural programmes across a wide range of areas and encourage EU-wide state initiatives to strengthen links between citizens. We will link capital investment to Arts projects similar to the Irish Percent for Arts scheme.

ENHANCE EU TWINNING INITIATIVES TO ENCOMPASS SECONDARY SCHOOLS

The Europe for Citizens programme has been successful in driving on twinning programmes between EU towns. This should be further deepened with a specific secondary school twinning programme to link young people together. This will promote a stronger sense of EU identity and language learning. An EU-wide information campaign to promote twinning should also be launched to encourage more towns and cities to participate across the continent.

DEEPEN OIREACHTAS LINKS WITH THE EU PARLIAMENT

The populist backlash against the EU has a wide range of causes. One major factor has been a growing sense of alienation from EU decision making. Deeper engagement is needed so that we can to tackle this widening gulf. Our Fianna Fáil team will ensure citizens are connected to their representatives and that the EU is working for them. Regular Oireachtas updates on the work of the EU will help to bridge that divide and enhance democratic oversight.

TACKLING INTERNATIONAL CRIME

Crime is global and cybercrime, sex trafficking and drug smuggling all spill across national boundaries. Furthermore, the threat of violent attacks from a disparate web of terror groups does not stop at borders. Defending the values that Ireland and the EU share from the encroachment of criminality and the direct assaults of terrorism means a connected, co-operative network of EU police forces. An Garda Siochána needs to be fully equipped and plugged into their international counter parts to identify and neutralise a multiplicity of criminal threats. We will support the reform of the Internal Security Fund to develop and strengthen cross border operations, best practise exchange and quick information transfers.

BUILD ON EU-WIDE HEALTH INITIATIVES

Providing quality healthcare should remain a central responsibility of each member state. However, there is further scope for the EU to improve cross border healthcare, enhancing outcomes for patients and reducing the cost for states. Ireland should be at the forefront of these efforts. Fianna Fáil will support a range of measures to build on and strengthen existing EU health policies.

WE WILL:
• Launch an EU-wide information campaign on Cross Border Health access
• Strengthen EU-wide efforts to tackle tobacco use
• Promote investment in health promotion and disease prevention, patient-centred approaches, digital literacy, health workforce sustainability, patient safety and the respect of patients’ rights
• Work to tackle healthcare associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
• Encourage the use of vaccines using science not politics as the basis for persuasion
• Facilitating the sharing and dissemination of best practices in healthcare and mental health care among member states
• Encourage EU-wide legislation to protect human health from environmental exposures

SECURE THE IRISH LANGUAGE’S STATUS IN EUROPE

Our national language is an invaluable cultural asset and intrinsic part of our nation. It is a distinct thread in the rich, diverse cultural fabric of Europe. In 2005 Fianna Fáil secured official status for the Irish language in the EU as part of our efforts to promote its use.

Building on this our team in Europe will endeavour to use the Irish language in Parliament as much as possible to show leadership on the issue. We will fully support the process to end derogation by 2021 to allow the language to become a fully functioning working language of the EU. 

Fighting for the EU’s values in the world

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:

The remarkable success of the EU in achieving an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity across the continent is a beacon of light for the globe. With mounting global uncertainty due to the irresponsible attitudes adopted by the current US administration, the rise of China and growing threats to democratic institutions, the EU’s role as a global leader is more important than ever.

SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A EUROPEAN AGENCY FOR THE PROTECTION OF DEMOCRACIES

The EU is founded upon human rights, international co-operation and democratic values, and the rule of law. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, the use of fake news by Russia to manipulate foreign elections and the use of social media in stoking ethnic tensions in Asia all highlight the risk that social media can pose to democracies. Foreign agents or domestic threats can use the internet to wage asymmetrical digital war on the institutions that sustain our democracies.

In a time of global uncertainty, the EU should take the lead in defending democracy. Fianna Fáil supports the creation of a European Agency for the Protection of Democracies to lead this critical challenge. This agency will be responsible for setting EU-wide standards on banning foreign money and influence in EU member state elections. It will aid and assist in efforts to defend against cyber-attacks and digital manipulation.

BACK THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONFERENCE FOR EUROPE TO SET OUT THE FUTURE OF THE EU

Brexit has marked an unprecedented reversal of the historic trend of expansion of the EU. It cannot be allowed to generate an era of stagnation and decline. The EU is more important than ever in defending core democratic values and fostering economic growth and prosperity. We need to take stock and chart a new path forward for the Union that recognises the complexity of today’s world. A Conference for Europe would present an opportunity to move our gaze beyond Brexit to the long-term future of the Union.

FULLY MAINTAIN OUR NEUTRALITY STATUS

Fianna Fáil is proud of Ireland’s tradition of neutrality that stretches back to the Second World War. It has enabled us to play a leading role as independent peace keepers across the globe, untainted by military associations. Fianna Fáil is opposed to the creation of an EU-wide army as it would breach our central principle of neutrality. Any role Ireland plays in European Defence Agency programmes should be guided by this core policy of maintaining our neutrality, underpinned by the triple lock mechanism.

LINK EU FUNDING TO UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW IN EACH MEMBER STATE

Democratic backsliding within the frontiers of the EU cannot and should not be tolerated. We must uphold the highest standards for member states in order to protect the core values that keep the Union together. Worrying developments including the erosion of judicial independence and the undermining of a free media in Hungary and Poland are reminders that vigilance must be constant. EU funding under Cohesion funds or other EU led initiatives should be linked to maintaining the basic standards of the EU.

HELP ADDRESS THE MIGRANT SITUATION

Conflict, climate change and economic desperation are the driving factors in migrant flows that will continue to escalate over the decades. We need a humane policy that respects the human dignity of people trying to access better lives in Europe while maintaining the integrity of our borders and the states they protect. A humane, collective EU-wide asylum process should provide an expedited mechanism to process applications in every state. Additional funding is needed for the Green Climate Fund and European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to address root causes of the migrant challenge as well as fair trade deals with source countries to create new economic opportunities. Migrant centres in host countries outside of the EU should be adequately funded to maintain high standards and illegal human traffickers must be stamped out with military force.

PROMOTE MIGRANT INTEGRATION ACROSS THE EU

Ireland has been broadly successful to date in integrating “new Irish” communities. However, we cannot become complacent and let the sinister rot of racism gain a foothold. The growing migrant challenge propelled by climate change and a lack of economic opportunity will continue to put pressure on how we effectively integrate new arrivals across the EU. The EU should assist member states in drawing together the disparate strands of migrants in their countries. Fianna Fáil will support continued EU funding across a wide array of migrant integration streams.

WORK TOWARDS A TWO-STATE SOLUTION IN PALESTINE

The humanitarian crisis in Palestine remains an open sore in international relations. In light of the US’s current irresponsible position, the EU has an important role to play in revitalising peace efforts. Fianna Fáil believes in a two-state solution. The EU should move to end trade of products sourced from illegal settlements as a measure to end the aggressive annexation of Palestinian land and subsequent threat to a viable Palestinian state.

PUT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AT THE HEART OF EU POLICY

The UN Sustainable Development Goals charts a pathway to a greener and fairer future for the planet. The seventeen goals set out a clear vision of how to address some of the most pressing global challenges of our time. We all have a responsibility to tackle global poverty, inequality and climate change. The EU as the most successful transnational organisation in history should place these goals at the heart of its policies.

INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE EU SPACE PROGRAMME

Space represents an exciting opportunity for exploration, technical innovation and global co-operation. Fianna Fáil will support increased spending on the EU Space programme in conjunction with further co-operation with the EU Space Agency which Ireland has been a member of since 1975. 

Creating a Europe of Equals

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
• Implement EU Gender Quotas for Company Boards
• Introduce EU Election Gender Quotas
• Link EU funding in member states to equality of treatment for LGBTQI and all minority groups
• Put Disability rights at the heart of EU expansion and foreign policy

Europe has been a leading light in enshrining the rule of law and advancing the rights of all citizens regardless of gender, religion or sexual orientation. We will ensure that it will continue to build and expand upon this central role.

IMPLEMENT EU GENDER QUOTAS FOR COMPANY BOARDS

It is unacceptable that corporate boards continue to lack female representation. There remains an onus on the EU to press forward with new policies to boost female participation in the workforce. The EU should take the lead in setting gender quotas of 40% for boards of listed companies, as has been done in Norway, France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands.

INTRODUCE EU ELECTION GENDER QUOTAS

Achieving enhanced parity of representation is important in maintaining public faith in democracy. Currently 36% of MEPs are female but the national representation varies widely across each member state. Rolling out EU-wide gender quotas for candidates standing under recognised political parties would help to bolster the numbers and widen the representation across the Union.

LINK EU FUNDING IN MEMBER STATES TO EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR LGBTQI AND MINORITY GROUPS

Throughout its history, it has been a goal of the EU to defend vulnerable groups from unfair treatment. EU funding to each member state must be inextricably linked to maintaining the core values of the EU. Policies and legislation that breach the common standards of the EU should be financially punished. In addition, minimum standards of sexual health supports should be available in each member state.

Furthermore, LGBTQI rights must should be encompassed in the criteria of EU expansion and international aid programmes. This will entrench the EU’s role as a global leader in defending minority rights.

PUTTING DISABILITY RIGHTS AT THE HEART OF EU EXPANSION AND FOREIGN POLICY

People with a disability should not be forgotten about in assessing the international priorities of the EU. This means setting standards for disability rights in countries applying for EU membership as part of the core qualifying criteria. In addition, EU international aid programmes must also encompass disability rights in their central objectives. 

Tackling climate change

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
• Support EU Climate Change targets
• Put climate change at the heart of each EU institution’s mandate
• Launch a new EU Climate Bank to finance carbon transition projects
• Establish a Just Transition Fund
• Launch an EU wide circular economy to create new job opportunities
• Carbon cost EU Policy
• Expand European Central Bank powers to publish financial institutions climate change exposure

Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. It constitutes an existential threat and a moral, economic and social test for every state. The deeply disappointing decision of the USA to exit the Paris Climate Change agreement underlines the need for the EU to fully embrace the role as global leaders in tackling climate change.

SUPPORT AMBITIOUS EU CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS

The EU must become the global champion of the Paris climate change agreement. We cannot allow the irresponsible position taken by the US administration to jeopardise this critical agreement. The EU should fully adhere to the ambitious targets it has set to decarbonise by 2050 and work to accelerate this time frame by reducing emissions by 55% in 2030 relative to 1990 standards.

PUTTING CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE HEART OF EACH EU INSTITUTION’S MANDATE

A silo-based approach to climate change will not yield the results we need. The need to address climate change should be a central tread linking all aspects of EU policy. Fianna Fáil will work with all EU institutions and policy remits to ensure that each body upholds that central focus.

We welcomed the latest EU rules in relation to the use of single use plastic products by 2021 and we will prioritise initiatives to reduce marine waste by ensuring a more stringent approach to the “polluter’s pay” principle.

It is totally unacceptable that plastic is now entering our food chain and damaging marine life because of the vast quantities of plastic being dumped in the sea, beaches and elsewhere. Our team will do its utmost to ensure that Ireland will achieve a 90% collection target for plastic bottles by 2029 and that all plastic bottles will contain 25% of recycled content by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Producers and consumers will have to play their part in reaching these targets.

LAUNCH A NEW EU CLIMATE BANK TO FINANCE CARBON TRANSITION PROJECTS

The European Investment Bank has been successful in funding a wide array of capital investment projects across the EU. This idea should be broadened out to establish a new Climate Change focused bank. This Bank owned by the member states would be charged with financing the wide array of climate transition investments needed over the coming decades. Both public and private bodies would be eligible for funding through low interest rates.

ESTABLISH A JUST TRANSITION FUND

Climate transition will present a major challenge to how we treat citizens fairly. Certain areas will be disproportionately affected by the necessary shift away from carbon intensive activities. For example, the loss of Bord Na Mona jobs in the mid-lands warrants a targeted response. A Just Transition Fund should be rolled out across the EU to support these areas and communities. The fund will help attract new industries, finance educational opportunities and support local employment initiatives.

IMPLEMENT EU-WIDE CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO CREATE NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES

Shifting away from the traditional “takemake-waste” economic model is a critical departure in addressing the challenge of climate change. Reducing waste and reliance on finite resources that are growing increasingly volatile will have beneficial economic and environmental consequences. The circular economy process is a durable system to reduce resource consumption and drive on economic innovation. It will help secure broader objectives of creating new job opportunities, supporting economic growth and minimising environmental impacts.

Creating a regulatory and taxation framework to incentivise and facilitate business and government bodies to transition to a circular economy must be a priority for the next government. We will fully implement and monitor an EU wide Circular Economy drawing on existing EU Commission work on the issue.

CARBON COST EU POLICY

Each individual EU policy should be subjected to a rigorous carbon cost analysis. This means setting out in detail what the cost of an individual policy is in terms of the future consequences of climate change of the carbon created or displaced by the policy. This should be integrated in the Regulatory Impact Analysis currently undertaken on EU policy proposals. This mechanism will allow the EU to take fully informed decisions on policies with regard to what the long-term carbon impact of each measure will be.

EXPAND EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK POWERS TO PUBLISH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CLIMATE CHANGE EXPOSURE AND ENSURE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK PROJECTS ARE CLIMATE CHANGE PROOFED

Financial institutions have a critical role to play in adjusting their investments to reflect exposure to climate change. In keeping with the European Central Bank’s central mission of “safeguarding the value of the euro and maintaining price stability” we will expand its remit to encompass financial institutions transparency on climate change. Information on the banking sectors exposure to climate change will help to advance shareholder and public debate around where our money goes and highlight any additional hard regulation that may be required to help met climate change targets.

Furthermore, the investments of the EIB should be climate change proofed to ensure they do not jeopardise the EU’s carbon reduction targets. 

Protecting the Common Agricultural Policy

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
• Maintain CAP funding
• Ensure a fair CAP with a €60,000 l imit on direct payments and measures supporting young farmers
• Build a fair Common Fisheries Policy

CAP is a founding cornerstone of the European project. It secures the core incomes of 130,000 Irish family farms and sustains a secure food supply of affordable high-quality goods across the EU. Protecting the role of farmers as custodians of the countryside, ensuring rural communities benefit from economic growth and that quality, sustainable produce is affordable to all families. CAP and the Common Fisheries Policies (CFP) must be protected and adapted to ensure they are fit for purpose in the context of climate change, increased competition, the pressure on resources and the relentless drive to deliver more with less.

MAINTAIN CAP FUNDING

CAP is a cornerstone of the EU. It provides quality, affordable food on a secure basis. It helps maintain the family farm unit as a custodian of the countryside. CAP payments are the backbone of Irish farming, sustaining rural communities and ensuring food security, with payments making up around 75% of total Irish farm income. Average farm income is €31,000, lagging substantially behind the average industrial wage. Any reductions in CAP funding, in particular to Pillar 2 Rural Development funds, must be resisted as they will undermine EU-wide food security and adversely and disproportionately impact upon rural communities

ENSURE A FAIR CAP WITH A €60,000 LIMIT ON DIRECT PAYMENTS & MEASURES SUPPORTING YOUNG FARMERS

One of the weaknesses of the CAP system has been the subsidies paid to large companies. Fianna Fáil believes that ensuring each euro is spent effectively means targeting it better. A €60,000 limit on CAP payments to an individual recipient will impact only a small number. Critically, it will help to re-distribute existing resources more effectively by targeting additional supports to vulnerable sectors and generational renewal.

BUILD A FAIR COMMON FISHERIES POLICY

Thousands of families in coastal communities are reliant on an effective Common Fisheries Policy to facilitate their livelihoods and the communities’ dependent upon them. The main objective of the CFP is to make sure the needs of today’s EU fishing industry are met without jeopardising fish stocks for future generations. It must also provide a guaranteed income for fishermen and ensure a regular supply of top-quality seafood at reasonable prices for consumers while maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems. We will work to uphold a sustainable fishing industry in Ireland as part of the EU.

Fianna Fáil is determined that Ireland’s interests will be protected in any reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy and will seek to achieve this in future reviews with a view to expanding fishing opportunities. Securing a level playing field for all fishing activities in Irish controlled waters is another key priority, while introducing a more flexible and proportionate approach to inspections is vital for the future of the sector. We will continue to fight for maximum sustainable quotas for the Irish fishing industry in the annual fixing of EU catches and quotas. 

Delivering Prosperity

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
• Defend our Corporate Tax Rate and tax sovereignty
• Ensure a fair and effective EU Budget
• Fund a new EU Innovation Council
• Create an EU-wide Insurance market to reduce costs for consumers
• Establish an EU mortgage market to cut costs for borrowers
• Support SME friendly trade deals
• Maximise European Investment Bank loans for capital projects such as Housing and transport
• Address youth unemployment
• Boost Research, Innovation & Development Investment

The EU has played a central role in the fostering the prosperity of our country for almost 50 years. With a single market of over 500m people Irish businesses have benefited immensely from EU membership. In addition, it has established our state as a focal point for foreign direct investment (FDI). Extremist politics cannot be allowed to jeopardise the EU’s role as an engine of growth and prosperity in Ireland and across the continent.

DEFEND OUR CORPORATE TAX RATE AND TAX SOVEREIGNTY 

Ireland’s 12.5% corporate tax rate is the cornerstone of our FDI strategy. Many larger member states are eager to undermine this strategy through either a direct change or introducing Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). In addition, a Financial Transaction Tax or Digital Tax marks an erosion of national tax sovereignty which has been a lynchpin of the EU for decades. Ireland has played a leading role in OECD Base Erosion Profits (BEPS) programme and will continue to ensure companies pay the tax rate set by our state. However, we will not allow competition to be wilfully mischaracterised as the tenets of a tax haven. We will oppose any erosion of Member states veto on these matters and ensure companies in Ireland have tax planning certainty at an internationally competitive rate.

ENSURE A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE EU BUDGET 

The Multi-Annual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027 which is due to be decided in Autumn 2019, its mid-term review in 2023 and each annual budget within that framework, will set out the financial priorities of the EU. The Parliament has a central role in confirming the MFF and agreeing each budget. Ireland is now is a net contributor to the EU with approximately €200m per annum net going into the EU budget since 2014. In the context of Brexit and enhancing EU actions the new MFF will have to change substantially from its predecessor. Subject to negotiations, Fianna Fáil will support additional payments from Ireland if the core priorities outlined in this manifesto are protected and advanced.

FUND A NEW EU INNOVATION COUNCIL 

The new EU budget due to be passed in the upcoming EU Parliament term represents an opportunity to put a new focus on driving innovation in Europe. Fianna Fáil supports an ambitious and robust research and innovation programme (Horizon Europe) and the establishment of the European Innovation Council to lead financial supports for businesses.

CREATE AN EU-WIDE INSURANCE MARKET TO REDUCE COSTS FOR CONSUMERS 

The EU should always put the consumer at the heart of its policies. Insurance costs in Ireland are far too high and are hampering businesses day to day existence. In combination with domestic efforts to tackle costs the EU can play a role in fostering more competition to help drive down costs for customers. EU wide data sharing, standardised monitoring and regulations should be rolled out to encourage more companies into the market in Ireland.

ESTABLISH AN EU MORTGAGE MARKET TO CUT COSTS FOR BORROWERS 

Ireland has amongst the highest mortgage interest rates in the EU. With average interest rates at 3.04 per cent, we are 1.25 per cent higher than the euro zone average of 1.79 per cent. Fianna Fáil has been at the forefront of tackling high interest rates by ramping up central bank powers. The EU has an important part to play in promoting competition and driving down costs for borrowers.

Ireland needs a strong voice in Europe to advocate for a European wide single market for in mortgages that would bring rates down.

European regulations were brought into make the financial system more robust which is welcome. However, certain parts of the regulations are hurting Irish mortgage holders. Risk weighting for example penalises Irish mortgage holders disproportionally. Fianna Fáil will provide a strong voice to fight for Irish customers while maintaining the robustness of European regulations.

SUPPORT SME-FRIENDLY TRADE DEALS 

Ireland is a small open economy that has excelled in global markets. This has spurred on prosperity on our island and created immense opportunities for our people across a wide array of enterprises. Trade should remain a central feature of the EU and we should resist kneejerk populist protectionism from either the extreme left or right. Fianna Fáil supports viable trade deals with other trading blocs as a core part of a prosperous EU. However, we also believe that EU trade deals must be fair and protect the position of states and vulnerable sectors. Any agreements must uphold our core quality standards in areas such as agri-foods and labour rights. These trade deals should be focused on promoting and facilitating trade that benefits SMEs not just large corporations.

MAXIMISE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK LOANS SUCH AS HOUSING AND TRANSPORT PROJECTS 

The housing crisis demands a mixture of local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and private developers to build the amount and types of homes required. In March 2018 Eurostat re-classified AHBs as “General Government Sector”. Previously, AHBs in Ireland were classified by Eurostat as “non-profit institutions serving households” (NPISH) in their Institutional Sector Accounts. This technical accountancy change means that future financing for AHBs would impact on the EU Fiscal rules and limit their capacity to borrow and build new houses. The government needs to accelerate the re-classification of AHBs as off-balance sheet. Unfortunately, Fine Gael has made no progress on this to date. In contrast in England, the government successfully reformed the process and secured a re-classification by Eurostat.

Fianna Fáil will work at an EU level to ensure consistency in the classification system and secure housing as an investment rather than

expenditure under EU rules. We will highlight the key role of the EIB in providing funding to Irish Housing projects and secure additional financing.

ADDRESS YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT The impact of unemployment on young people can leave a permanent scarring impact with income losses felt over a lifetime of work. It also undermines the central, founding promise of the EU itself of creating a better world for the next generation. The Youth Employment guarantee should be reviewed and expanded to ensure it is delivering for the worst effected pockets of youth unemployment. The European Social Fund should identify key apprenticeship opportunities in member states and enable young people to access ERAMUS programmes where there are insufficient opportunities in their home member state.

BOOST RESEARCH, INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT Improving research and development facilities is central to a sustainable economic recovery for Europe. Europe must significantly sharpen the quality of its R&D so it is focused on key unmet societal needs. Health and transport are two areas that could benefit hugely from an improved R&D focus. Fianna Fáil will support: · Swift agreement at EU institutional and Member State level for the proposed ‘Horizon Europe’ Research and Innovation programme fund to cover the 2021-2027 period.

· Simplifying the application process and reduce the time to grant funding to EU funded Research and Innovation projects to increase the take up of small and medium sized companies’ especially micro firms.
· Reducing any unnecessarily cumbersome processes which can lose sight of the purpose for which they were established in the first place in drawing down EU Research and Innovation programme funding.
· Greater supports for home grown scientific research in Member States.
· Ensuring proportionate funding between commercial and basic research (blue skies research).
· Providing adequate funding to EU information offices in each Member State to promote European Research and innovation funding to increase SME take up. 

Building a strong Eurozone

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:

· Complete Banking Union with a Eurozone Deposit Insurance scheme 
· Establish a European Monetary Fund 
· Build a real Fiscal and Transfer Union to prepare for future downturns 
· Change the fiscal rules to allow for greater capital investment The Eurozone crisis rocked the EU to its foundations and inflicted financial misery on countless households. We need to strengthen the defences of the Euro to ensure any future downturn does not cause such a financial disaster again.

COMPLETE THE BANKING UNION WITH A EUROZONE DEPOSIT INSURANCE SCHEME Over a decade on from the financial crash and Eurozone crisis that rocked the Union more needs to be done to protect the Eurozone. We cannot allow complacency to set in or we risk inviting another financial crash. The missing pieces in the Eurozone framework that were ruthlessly exposed during the financial crisis still need to be addressed. While significant progress has been made on the Banking Union that is vital to underpinning a renewed, fit for purpose Euro more remains to be done. Fianna Fáil will work to complete the banking union with a Eurozone wide Deposit Insurance scheme. This will help to avoid the doom loop of sovereign and banking debt dragging each down in the future.

ESTABLISH A EUROPEAN MONETARY FUND

The Eurozone was ill-prepared for the financial crash and failed to react with the speed and scale of assistance needed in comparison to the USA. The European Stability Mechanism was a belated step to stave off the Eurozone crisis. Bolstering the fund and ensuring it has the flexibility to effectively help embattled member states will be a priority for Fianna Fáil. We will work to revamp the European Stability Mechanism into a new European Monetary Fund to ensure it is fit for purpose in preventing and tackling any future financial crisis.

BUILD A REAL FISCAL AND TRANSFER UNION TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE DOWNTURNS

Tackling economic downturns and financial crisis must involve more than fiscal austerity. The Eurozone needs to be prepared for a rainy day which will inevitably come at some stage in the future. A Eurozone budget and joint bond issues will help to address the imbalance between monetary union and the lack of fiscal union. It will help to ensure the EU is equipped to deal with future downturns. Fianna Fáil will work with our EU colleagues to build up a mutually beneficial Fiscal union.

CHANGE THE FISCAL RULES TO ALLOW FOR GREATER CAPITAL INVESTMENT

The Fiscal Compact and other spending rules were designed to co-ordinate policies and protect the integrity of the Eurozone. However overly stringent rules risk undermining the basis for sound capital investment. With pressing demands in climate change transition and housing we need to facilitate targeted long-term investment. Fianna Fáil will work for a review of the Eurozone spending rules to enable further capital investment in critical infrastructure. 

Preparing for Brexit

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
· Give the UK time and space to move forward 
· Protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent a hard border 
· Amend state aid rules to support SMEs affected by Brexit 
· Secure funding for regions and sectors impacted by Brexit 
· Maintain PEACE & INTERREG

Funding and defend Northern Irish citizens EU rights Brexit cannot be allowed to define the next five years of the EU. However we need to defend and protect Ireland’s uniquely vulnerable position. The costs of Brexit range from damaging to disastrous for the Irish economy. It is in Ireland’s strategic interest to advocate for a Brexit that is as close as feasible to current arrangements. The integrity of the Good Friday Agreement should be fully upheld in any agreement.

SUPPORT GIVING THE UK TIME AND SPACE TO MOVE FORWARD TO AGREE THE WITHDRAWAL TREATY

While we deeply regret the Brexit vote result, we must respect it and the democratic process in the UK. We will give the UK sufficient space to resolve their internal issues and move forward. Additional extensions to Brexit should be granted where required in order to avoid a disastrous No Deal Brexit scenario. We will fully support the revocation of Article 50 and retention of UK membership of the EU if that eventually emerges from debate in the UK.

PROTECT THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT AND PREVENT A HARD BORDER

It is essential that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland so that the all Island economy can be protected. It is also fundamental that we protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement. From an economic, social and psychological perspective a hard border would be hugely damaging to the island of Ireland.

It is a strategic priority for Ireland to maintain and protect the Withdrawal Treaty in any future Brexit negotiations. We accept that the integrity of the Single Market must be protected in order to preserve the reputation and market access of Irish goods. The strength of the protection of the single market is vital to preventing chlorinated chicken or other low quality foods and goods infiltrating the Irish market.

AMENDING STATE AID RULES TO SUPPORT SMES AFFECTED BY BREXIT

Ireland’s trading relationship with the UK is of vital importance. The UK is our largest trading partner with approximately €1.2billion in goods and services traded every week. Our common membership of the European Union has underpinned our strong trading relationship. The repercussions for the Irish economy will be profound and long term. While there are opportunities for Ireland arising from Britain’s departure from the Single Market, industries such as the agri-food sector and geographic areas will be severely affected and will require targeted support.

Targeted assistance and support will be vital in minimising the damage of Brexit. The EU must expedite their plans in assistin those adversely affected by the economic consequences of Brexit. This could work in the same manner as the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund which assists workers left unemployed as a result of the effects of globalisation. Ireland has made 10 successful applications to that fund. Revisions to state aid rules will be required in order to enable such supports targeted at SMEs.

- We will work with our EU colleagues to build a new consensus around state aid restrictions to empower businesses to equip themselves to compete directly with Britain in line with the details that emerge from the Article 50 negotiations.

SECURE FUNDING FOR REGIONS AND SECTORS IMPACTED BY BREXIT

The dire economic consequences of Brexit have been comprehensively set out by bodies such as the ERSI. The disproportionate impact of the British withdrawal of specific industries and geographic regions will require a systematic EU response. It is imperative that adequate contingency supports and market disturbance funding is proved at EU level for farmers and fishermen in order to mitigate against harmful impact of Brexit. Complementing the state aid rule changes, targeted EU assistance aimed at assisting the worst effected sectors will be vital in alleviating the worst consequences of Brexit.

MAINTAIN PEACE & INTERREG FUNDING AND DEFEND NORTHERN IRISH CITIZENS EU RIGHTS

The decision of the United Kingdom to exit the EU has left Northern Ireland in a uniquely vulnerable position. This is particularly relevant given that the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain and have a right to EU citizenship by virtue of their right to Irish citizenship.

The EU played a key role in driving forward the peace process and in financing strategic investments in the region. This risks being lost through the UK exit. We need to protect EU funding and the rights of EU citizens in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday agreement. PEACE and INTERREG Funding have played a central part in securing the peace process and need to be fully maintained.

We welcome the commitment of the European Commission to peace funding in Northern Ireland until the end of 2020. We will work with our EU colleagues to ensure the special position of Northern Ireland continues to be recognised in concrete form. This should involve access to targeted EU funding. 

Regulating Big Tech

FIANNA FÁIL WILL:
· Promote a “Green Data” ethos in technology regulation 
· Protect Children from on-line pornography and gambling 
· Create a new EU Digital Bill of Rights 
· Regulate Big Tech firms 
· Roll out 5G across the EU 
· End unfair Geo-Blocking 
· Protect Creators & publishers’ value

Technology is playing a greater role in every aspect of our day to day lives. However, regulation is far behind making the area a modern-day Wild West. We need to ensure that the standards we expect in the real world are not abandoned in the Digital world that now occupies so much of our economic, political and social lives. “Green data” means regulating technology in an ethical manner that recognises that individual data should be subject to both privacy rights and the common good. It marks a shift away from the unregulated laisse faire approach that has characterised much of the advance of technology to date.

PROMOTE “GREEN DATA” ETHOS IN TECHNOLOGY REGULATION

The growth of surveillance capitalism as the core business model of technology firms is bad for society and the economy. Secretly collating, analysing and selling data to the highest bidder on users has had a negative impact creating consumer and political echo chambers.

Fianna Fáil believes Europe should continue to lead the way in “Green Data”, an ethically grounded view of how consumer data should be used. We will build on the roll out of GDPR to copper fasten consumer rights, protect creators’ content, place an onus on businesses to take responsibility and create a sustainable web.

PROTECT CHILDRN FROM ON-LINE PORNOGRAPHY AND GAMBLING

Online pornography, which experts say can damage a child’s development and decision-making, has been seen by 65% of 15 to 16-year-olds and 48% of 11 to 16-year-olds, according to a UK NSPCC report in 2016.

The study also found that 28% of children may have stumbled across pornography while 19% had searched for it deliberately. Some reports put the age that children first view porn at 11.

The scale and ease of access through any connected device means that anyone – children included – can potentially see high-resolution, hardcore pornographic images and videos in just a couple of clicks. To make sure that children are as safe as possible online and help parents feel more in control, we need to put limits in place.

We will work at EU level to ensure adequate protections are put in place to prevent children from accessing unsuitable sites such as pornography and gambling.

CREATE A NEW EU DIGITAL BILL OF RIGHTS

With the exponential growth of the web in people’s everyday lives we need to protect citizen’s rights in the digital age.

Fianna Fáil believes that all EU citizens should enjoy a suite of rights. This Bill of Rights will set out a comprehensive list of what each citizen in the EU can expect as part of our efforts to democratise the internet.

This will include:
- High Speed Broadband Access
- 4G & 5G Access
- Protection for children and vulnerable adults
- Transparency and consent over your data use

REGULATE BIG TECH FIRMS

The concentration of market power in the hands of a handful of tech firms represents a political and economic challenge. Firms that in effect are monopolies due to the nature of the sector need to be effectively regulated similar to other public utilities. This can only be done effectively at an EU wide scale. Any firm reaching a multi-billion threshold should be treated as public utility and regulated accordingly. Mergers should be sanctioned on a severely restricted basis, unwound where required and platform dominance avoided. We need distinct regulations for each sector to ensure that the long-term interests of consumers and citizens are protected. The EU Commissioner for Competition remit should be expanded where necessary to undertake this new role.

ROLL OUT 5G ACROSS THE EU

In keeping with our Digital Bill of Rights we will ensure the EU is at the cutting edge of technological innovation. EU funding should help ensure 5G networks will be rolled out securely across the continent in keeping with broader security objectives to underpin the next generation of tech progress.

END UNFAIR GEO-BLOCKING

The EU has made progress on Geo-Blocking with new rules coming into force from December. We will ensure the rules are rigorously implemented and kept under review to ensure the unfair practice of Geo-Blocking for consumers in the EU comes to an end.

PROTECT CREATORS AND PUBLISHERS’ VALUE

We need an even playing field between publishers, content creators and the platforms that hosts them on the internet. The prevailing business model of data value extraction by large tech firms is not sustainable and ultimately will damage democracy, the media and the creative community. Content creators deserve and need to be adequately compensated for their work. Undermining the financial basis for publishing, music and film will eventually suffocate those sectors and remove core pillars of a democratic society. We will uphold and strengthen the recent EU Copyright Directive. ",2019,"EP","Fianna Fail","Fianna Fail_2019_EP"
"EP 2019: Fine Gael","Foreword

Fine Gael is the party of Europe. We brought Ireland into the Single European Act and the Single Market and we helped shape the Union it has become today. These European elections come at a critical juncture in our history. Our place at the heart of the most powerful grouping in European politics, the European People’s Party, has stood to us throughout the Brexit process. We will stay steadfast in securing an orderly Brexit deal that protects our economy and the Good Friday Agreement.

This manifesto outlines how we plan to ensure Ireland is not defined by Brexit. It is about the future, not the past. At present, the EU is considering the future shape of Europe - whether and how the EU needs to be reformed to face new challenges. We will ensure Irish views are at the heart of this process. We believe in a global Ireland at the centre of the world, in control of our destiny and with the power to shape a better future for the Irish and European citizens of today and tomorrow.

Europe is interwoven into Fine Gael’s policies. At our most recent National Conference in March 2019, Fine Gael delegates voted to add ‘Europe and Openness’ to our Party’s values – the core beliefs around which we base our policies and ideas for the future.

We have a five-step vision for a better future:
1. A strong economy that rewards work, backs business and enables all citizens to reach their potential.
2. A society in which nobody feels left out – equal opportunities and a second chance for all.
3. World class infrastructure – to facilitate balanced growth in Ireland through Project Ireland 2040.
4. Protecting our environment for the next generation.
5. Ireland – at the centre of the world – at the heart of the European Union and committed to the United Nations.

At a time when some countries are turning inwards and choosing nationalism ahead of multilateralism, the EU must step up and demonstrate the power of shared decision-making. As a global island, we believe that multilateralism strengthens, not diminishes, our diversity, our self-confidence and our security. Ireland and the EU must play our part in shaping together the kind of world in which we want to live, rather than responding to a world shaped by others.

Harnessing the influence of our strong team, Fine Gael MEPs’ priorities will be:
1. Driving Europe’s social agenda
2. Creating more jobs, investment and a competitive EU
3. Brexit and forging new alliances in Europe
4. A fair Common Agricultural Policy and Fisheries Policy
5. Leading on climate change
6. Promoting a safe and compassionate Europe

Introduction

Fine Gael wants Ireland to be at the heart of Europe. This is something that was raised by people when I travelled the country last year as part of our Citizens’ Dialogue on the Future of Europe. Irish people are overwhelmingly in support of our membership of the EU.

Ireland’s population is the youngest in Europe with a third of our people aged under 25. These young Irish people are particularly supportive of the EU and want to be part of its future. They believe in a fairer and more integrated Europe. One that they can benefit and learn from. One where they can continue to travel, work, study and live in; without traditional barriers or borders.

Fine Gael believes in investing and delivering in programmes that help to develop our future and keep us competitive in an ever globalised world.

The Irish Citizens’ Dialogue process that I led last year heard a wide range of views from right across society based on different thematic areas.

Those themes helped to frame our discussion that led to the Government publishing our paper on the Future of Europe that will be presented by the Taoiseach and myself in Sibiu, Romania in May of this year.

This manifesto outlines our policies and priorities for the next five years in the European Parliament.

Fine Gael wants to be your voice in Europe. Fine Gael, as members of the European People’s Party, is best placed to ensure you are heard at the centre of EU decision making.


Driving Europe’s

Social Agenda

The European Union and its Member States have endured a difficult decade. The era of bailouts created a perception of a Union defined by austerity. But this is not the case; there are so many more dimensions to Europe. The EU has been the driving force behind the strengthening of key areas of social policy in Ireland since the 1970s, such as equality and non-discrimination legislation. Recent polling data reaffirms the Irish people’s support for the EU and their recognition of the benefits our membership has brought to Ireland.

We know from the recent Citizens’ Dialogues on the future of Europe that Irish people’s overarching desire is for fairness – fairness between Member States, fairness in education and employment opportunities, and fairness between generations. Moreover, the EU needs to communicate better what it does and reaffirm its significance in the daily lives of EU citizens.

Arising from the Social Summit in Gothenburg (November 2017), EU leaders signed up to the European Pillar of Social Rights. It sets out how the EU can deliver new and more effective rights for citizens across 20 principles in three categories: (i) equal opportunities and access to the labour market, (ii) fair working conditions and (iii) social protection and inclusion.

By standing for a social Europe relevant to citizens’ needs and economic circumstances, Fine Gael MEPs will stand up to nationalists and populists who want to undermine the EU. Promoting this approach with more transparent democratic engagement, including through legislative initiatives, will be important in resisting those who want to erode the EU’s platforms for social rights and environmental action.

The future of work is one of the defining challenges of our time and we need to adapt our labour laws and social security services, upgrade the skills of our people and sufficiently support all actions we take in this area.

Building on this, our MEPs, strongly represented on the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, have already passed new legislation that helps parents to share caring responsibilities more fairly so that women have more opportunities to develop their full potential in the labour market. MEPs passed laws that ban cancer-causing chemicals and save thousands of lives. Most recently, MEPs set rules for a fair European labour market and delivered rules that make precarious work more transparent and predictable.

A key priority for our MEPs in the next parliamentary term will be promoting work-life balance and gender equality. We will seek to broaden the impact of what the EU can do to promote gender equality, such as taking action on the gender pay gap and the gender pension gap.

Ensuring all European citizens live healthier lives must be a priority for the new legislative mandate. We will prioritise health care and develop cooperation between MEPs and Member States on health services and ensure people feel empowered to cross borders for medical attention, supported by improving patient access with more patient-centred health systems.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Progress the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, ensuring it remains a priority of the next European Commission and European Parliament, including giving it due focus in deliberations on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).
• Work with the Irish Government to ensure the Pillar is actively prioritised and seek to improve the number of categories in which Ireland scores ‘best performer’ among all Member States.
• Secure increased funding for the European Social Fund (ESF+). It is not enough to draft laws, take initiatives and coordinate policies. We also need to put our money where our mouth is. The ESF+ will provide the main EU financial instrument for improving workers’ mobility and employment opportunities and strengthening social cohesion and fairness. This includes the Youth Employment Initiative, which helps to fund the Youth Guarantee offering under 25s an offer of employment, training or education.
• Promote good mental health and promote awareness of opportunities to link Ireland, the EU, Member States and MEPs more closely together in the area of mental health.
• Propose that the European Commission designate 2022 as the European Year of Good Mental Health.
• Support the efforts of the Work Forum to monitor Member States’ implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
• Promote independent living across the EU for people with disabilities, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
• Promote the work of the Disability Intergroup in the European Parliament to ensure MEPs focus on improving the lives of people with disabilities during the next legislature.
• Combat the challenges of an ageing population. As part of the EPP grouping, we will support innovation and investment in the area of health and develop the silver economy to promote active ageing.
• Support efforts to create a European Master Plan to pool our joint resources and data in order to research ways of tackling diseases such as cancer. We will increase funds and strengthen the European Innovation Council in order to enable better support to innovators and entrepreneurs on high-risk and breakthrough innovations so that new markets can be created.

PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Back proposals to better ensure that women and men receive equal pay for equal work by reducing the gender pay gap and the gender pension gap and further advance equal opportunities for women in economic and social life.
• Promote a better work-life balance and facilitate greater choice on how parents and care givers balance their work and caring responsibilities.
• Promote in the European Parliament the adoption of the policy objectives in the National Women’s Council of Ireland’s Feminist Manifesto for Europe, which includes a 40% quota for company boardrooms across Europe.
• Advocate for ‘wage transparency’ in SMEs across the single market, building on Ireland’s wage transparency legislation to promote gender equality.

Creating more jobs, investment and a competitive EU

A successful economy allows us to shape the kind of society we want. Along with our EPP colleagues, Fine Gael will continue to break down barriers in the single and digital markets, positioning the EU to be competitive on the world stage and to improve living standards for all.

The Single Market is among the most important achievements of the EU, but it is not yet complete. People should be able to avail of cheaper loans and insurance across Europe under the Single Market and yet that is simply not a reality. Completing the Single Market and Digital Single Market will be key priorities for Fine Gael MEPs in the next European Parliament term.

Completing the Single Market will be a key enabler in delivering the EPP target of creating an additional 5 million new jobs in the coming years, especially for the younger generation. We will also support a competitive EU and open up new markets with additional free trade agreements.

We will complete the Banking Union with a European Deposit Insurance Scheme – provided that the risks in the European banking system have been significantly reduced - in order to safeguard citizens’ savings and strengthen the tools needed to boost investments during downturns.

Having moved from being a net beneficiary to being a net contributor today, Fine Gael MEPs will work towards agreeing a fair and ambitious new EU budget from 2021 to 2027. We are open to contributing more funding over the next period, but only if it is spent on areas that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal – sustaining the CAP, funding for research and innovation and unlocking the potential of disadvantaged areas within the EU.

SINGLE MARKET

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Lead measures to complete the Single Market and Digital Single Market, particularly regarding services. Completing the existing Single Market could potentially deliver €651 billion to €1.1 trillion additional benefit per year, creating 7.5 million jobs by 2030.
• Fulfil the promise of the Single Market in all areas. We will work towards a well-developed single market for financial services, in the area of banking, mortgages and insurance. We believe in an EU-wide insolvency regime and an EU-wide credit worthiness procedure which would help to develop the single market for financial services.
• Work more closely with Member States and EPP colleagues on the cost of medicines.

We should pool the buying power of the EU’s 450 million people. This could save billions for taxpayers, freeing up funding to ensure that modern medicines are available to patients at the same time in every country.
• Monitor Member States’ transposition of, and the adequacy of, the newly ratified Copyright Directive (April 2019) which updates current copyright rules to cater for the digital age, guaranteeing fair pay for creators, strong rights for users and responsibility for platforms.
• Promote a pan-European pension market which allows for easier portability of pensions and access to private pensions in other Member States. A key part of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) agenda aims to boost pension provision in the EU. This complements the Irish Government’s Roadmap for Pension Reform to address the potential pensions time bomb.

TAXATION

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Actively engage with work in the area of the digital economy at both OECD and EU level. We will be committed participants and supporters of tax reform efforts led by the OECD through the BEPS process.
• Oppose any proposals to introduce a digital services tax, if the EU goes down this route alone. Taxation policy needs to catch up with the reality of a changing digital economy. This work is best done on a global basis through the OECD. Fine Gael will not support unilateral measures which could cause a trading risk and which will undermine the competitiveness of exporting Member States.
• Re-affirm Ireland’s commitment to a 12.5% corporation tax rate and closely monitor proposals for a common corporate tax base, a financial transactions tax and a digital services tax.
• Support the retention of national competency over fiscal and taxation matters and resist proposals for a new European Finance Minister with special budgetary powers.

BANKING AND FINANCIAL REFORM

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Support efforts to complete the European Banking Union and the creation of an effective European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which would ensure savings are equally protected across Member States and further sever the link between banks and the State.
• Support the Capital Markets Union (CMU), which aims to provide new sources of funding for SMEs and reduce the cost of raising capital.
• Work to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism’s responsibility for the development and monitoring of financial assistance programmes. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is the euro area’s crisis lending body.
• Advocate for the retention of the current intergovernmental voting structure of the ESM, whereby Ireland retains decision-making responsibility. While we believe the ESM should have greater responsibilities in some areas, Member States should remain in control of decision making.
• Support an ambitious Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027 that responds to emerging challenges such as climate change and the digital agenda.
• Work with the European Investment Bank and other EU institutions to maximise investment in Ireland, particularly for our SMEs, through the InvestEU fund, the Connecting Europe Facility for Transport and other mechanisms.

TRADE AND INVESTMENT

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to open new markets for Irish exports through new free and fair-trade agreements, while defending our high standards and preventing unfair trade practices.
• Help strengthen the EU-US Transatlantic Relationship, making use of Ireland’s unique connection to the US.
• Support the agreement of an ambitious EU-US trade deal. We welcome the Council’s new mandate for negotiations. Fine Gael MEPs supported the CETA agreement and the EU Japan trade agreement because they are good for jobs, investment and growth.
• Support the full implementation of the Strategic Partnership Agreement with Japan, alongside the Economic Partnership Agreement.
• Re-invigorate the idea of ‘entrepreneur ambassadors’ based on the model of the European Round Table of Industrialists, as a forum for senior industry figures to meet and consider new ideas.
• Promote Ireland’s position as the largest English-speaking country in the EU post-Brexit particularly in the legal and financial areas.
• Work with European Parliament colleagues to share best practice on ‘night culture’. The night time economy is increasingly regarded as a source of untapped potential and big European cities are moving ahead with proposals to broaden the set of cultural options open to residents and tourists.

REDUCING RED TAPE

The SME test – Think Small First – is an example of how a simple EU proposal can have a big impact in every town and village in Ireland. The SME Test now obliges policymakers to consider the negative impact of any new legislation or regulation which may create a burden on SMEs through stakeholder engagement and other mechanisms. Decisions taken in Brussels must not block, but facilitate, business growth.

Fine Gael MEPs will work to:

> Cut bureaucracy for SMEs, including using digital tools and simulations which can free up SMEs from unnecessary and burdensome reporting duties.
> Cut 1,000 outdated EU rules and regulations in line with the EPP Group to eliminate inefficiencies and streamline our productive capacities.
> Support new proposals to strengthen and improve the Better Regulation Agenda following the recent public consultation and ‘stocktaking’ of the current system. This will ensure new EU laws pass a common sense test and are of a high quality (through impact assessment) and abide by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
> Modernise our legislation so that we are ready for technological changes and provide a solid and functioning legal framework for companies operating in Europe.

INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE

Responding to Irish people’s feedback in the Citizens’ Dialogues on the future of Europe, we want to see Europe invest more in young people, through education, training, innovation and employment opportunities. Horizon 2020 has successfully supported collaborative research and investment in our long-term future. EU funding in the research and innovation area has helped discover new planets, make major advances on cancer treatment and come up with new innovations to tackle climate change. We want to build on Horizon 2020 with the EU’s new and even more ambitious research and innovation training programme for the post-2020 period, Horizon Europe. This funding allows us to deliver on key priorities such as the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As outlined in the Irish Government’s Future Jobs Ireland 2019, we need to embrace innovation and technological change in order to position Ireland to respond to the profound challenges ahead. It is in Ireland’s interests to inhabit a world that is globalised and open and which responds to the challenges of the future through collaboration. Turning inwards and protecting what we have only leads to a spiral of diminishing returns. Our people are our greatest resource and our unique competitive advantage. For our economy to flourish, we need to be able to upskill throughout our careers.

Through the Erasmus programme we can promote a collaborative approach. Erasmus is one of the most recognised and successful EU programmes since its inception by the late Peter Sutherland. We want to expand the Erasmus programme and open it up to even more parts of society not traditionally associated with the programme.

While Fine Gael MEPs will make their mark over the next five-year term, Irish officials in the EU will continue to make their mark in the EU for decades to come. Irish people have held the highest civil service positions in the EU institutions over the past four decades. We want to make sure the EU institutions are attractive places to work for our young people and enable them to have the academic and language skills to succeed.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to triple funding for Erasmus to €45 billion for the next EU budget 2021-2027, in line with the European Parliament’s position. This will help develop young Irish people’s language skills and their ability to work in the EU institutions. It will also complement the targets contained in the Government’s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017-2026 and the Action Plan for Education, aiming to make Ireland’s education system the best in Europe in the next decade.
• Expand the Erasmus programme into other areas such as vocational training and schools.
• Work closely with Irish universities and researchers to promote the EU’s new ambitious research and innovation programme – Horizon Europe – and help to ensure Irish projects get their fair share of funds.
• Continue to support the European Parliament Ambassador School Programme for secondlevel students.
• Expand DiscoverEU Interrail for all 18-year-olds to encourage a new generation to discover Europe and build positive relationships and outlooks across the continent.
• Advocate policies that close skills gaps and which seek to match workers’ skills with the skills employers need.
• Seek to increase investment in artificial intelligence and robotics to make the EU the leader in this field, be competitive globally and shape these innovations in line with European values.
• Support the development of the EPP proposal for a new European University Institute 4.0 to respond to the needs of ‘Industry 4.0’ (the fourth industrial revolution) powered by automation.

IRELAND’S PRESENCE IN THE EU INSTITUTIONS

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Target an increase in the number of young Irish people applying for internship positions in the European institutions through outreach work.
• Highlight the issue of under-representation and the demographic cliff edge facing Irish staff in the institutions. Many Irish staff in the European Commission will be retiring within 15 years and not enough new Irish candidates are being recruited to replace those retiring. We understand that approximately 60% of the 500 or so Irish staff in the European Commission are over 50.
• Work with Irish officials and universities to promote the EU institutions as a career option.
• Raise awareness of Irish language opportunities within the EU institutions. Feasacht a ardú maidir le deiseanna in institiúidí an AE leis an nGaeilge.
• Support the continued recognition of Irish as an official language of the European Union. This is a priority for the Government, and we are committed to eliminating the derogation, as circumstances allow. Tacú leis an aitheantas atá ag an nGaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre den Aontas Eorpach. Is tosaíocht é sin ag an Rialtas agus táimid tiomanta deireadh a chur leis an maolú, ag brath ar chúinsí.
• Work to ensure the Irish Government and the Higher Education Authority provides adequate funding for relevant Irish language third level courses. We need to step up the current recruitment rate of Irish speakers into the EU institutions and increase the number of students graduating with the required skillset. Oibriú lena chinntiú go gcuirfidh an Rialtas agus an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas maoiniú leordhóthanach ar fáil do chúrsaí tríú leibhéal Gaeilge iomchuí. Ní mór dúinn géarú ar an ráta earcaíochta ar chainteoirí Gaeilge in Institiúidí an AE agus cur le líon na mac léinn a mbronntar céimeanna orthu a bhfuil na scileanna riachtanacha acu.

Brexit and forging new alliances in Europe

The outcome of UK deliberations on Brexit remain uncertain. We are focused on ensuring that any withdrawal of the UK from the EU is orderly and Fine Gael has the best team to make that happen. We are fully committed to protecting the Good Friday Agreement. We are conscious of the concerns of many people throughout Ireland, especially in Northern Ireland, about how Brexit might affect their rights, freedom of movement, and access to certain EU programmes. As our clear stand on the backstop shows, we will continue to work with the British Government and the EU to ensure the best outcomes for people throughout the island of Ireland.

Should Brexit happen, the next European Parliament will have to oversee and ratify negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. Fine Gael MEPs will work to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is fully reflected in the new framework of relationships between the EU and the UK. Alongside Irish citizens’ chosen and valued place at the heart of the EU, we are committed to harnessing the structures of the Agreement to further develop cooperation on our island and between these islands. We will also work for a close and stable relationship between the EU and the UK over the long term.

Fine Gael will ensure that no matter what happens, Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to be European citizens in all circumstances. That means the right to travel, work and study freely across the EU. The Common Travel Area will also be maintained in all circumstances, meaning Irish and British citizens will continue to move freely, reside and access a range of services in either jurisdiction.

Healthcare arrangements must be maintained to the greatest extent possible post-Brexit. Under the EU Cross Border Healthcare Directive, any Irish citizen has the right to access healthcare in another EU country and to be reimbursed for care abroad by their home country. Up to 2,000 Irish citizens avail of the EU Cross Border Healthcare Directive every year to obtain treatments in other EU Member States. Northern Ireland accounts for as much as 40% of these treatments, so it is vital that existing arrangements are maintained. Fine Gael MEPs will work to protect these arrangements for residents both sides of the border.

In the medium to long term, our MEPs have a key role to play in building new alliances in a postBrexit world. Apart from the economics and politics of Brexit, the UK’s departure will leave a big gap in the corridors and meeting rooms of Brussels and Strasbourg. Ireland has lost a natural ally and we must build new alliances and partnerships in order to maximise our capabilities and influence. This might mean teaming up with one country on a certain policy issue but disagreeing with the same country on other issues. We will use our position in the EPP to work with MEPs from all EU Member States who share our political views. MEPs and Member States

have shown remarkable solidarity with Ireland throughout the Brexit process. Fine Gael MEPs will be active in supporting other MEPs’ priorities over the next five-year term, as appropriate.

As part of the Government’s Global Ireland programme, which aims to double our global footprint by 2025, we are strengthening our permanent representation in Brussels and our embassies in Spain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the Nordic/Baltic countries. Largely protecting our diplomatic footprint throughout the financial downturn has helped immensely during the Brexit process, helping to inform other MEPs and Member States of Ireland’s position on Brexit and to feed back vital information to Dublin. We will back up our strong presence on the ground with a strong political presence at Council meetings. Fine Gael in government will always place a premium on ministerial attendance at European meetings, which dropped off during the 2000s.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work with colleagues in the European Parliament and elsewhere to secure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, which best protects people and key sectors throughout Ireland, and especially, Northern Ireland.
• Work with the Irish Government and the EU to help raise awareness among businesses about getting Brexit ready. Building on the close engagement with the Commission on these issues, in the event of a no deal, Ireland will be looking for further relaxation of state aid rules and for EU supports for business and agribusiness.
• Work within the European Parliament for a close future relationship between the EU and the UK, including a delegation to link MEPs and Members of the UK Parliament.
• Support the continued implementation of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes and ensure the implementation of a special new PEACE PLUS programme. These programmes are drivers of regional development in communities both sides of the border.
• Ensure the EU Cross-Border Health Directive is fully implemented by the HSE and that Irish citizens are aware of their healthcare rights as EU citizens.
• Work to ensure that treatments under the EU Cross-Border Health Directive can continue for residents both sides of the border.
• Work with the Irish Government and EU institutions to safeguard Northern Ireland residents’ continued access to the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in the event of a no deal outcome.
• Defend Ireland’s financial services industry in the case of a hard Brexit and support the development of the sector through the IFS2025 action plan.
• Complement the Government’s work to build new alliances, especially with the Benelux countries, the three Nordic countries and the three Baltic countries.
• Examine the possibility of establishing a structured exchange scheme between the Irish civil and public service and other EU member states. This would build relationships and help share new ideas.
• Work to ensure any proposed changes to EU-wide annual clock changes do not have an adverse impact on the island of Ireland.

A fair Common Agricultural Policy and Fisheries Policy

Agriculture and Fisheries will remain top priorities for Fine Gael MEPs in the next parliamentary term. We played a key leadership role in Europe finalising the existing Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget through the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU and through our strong presence in the European Parliament. Fine Gael has the best team, with the best experience, to deliver the best CAP for the current and next generation of farmers.

We recognise that farm families are the heartbeat of the rural economy and that the new CAP will be vital in securing investment in rural Ireland, for the expansion of the agri-food sector and the livelihoods of our farmers. Fine Gael is ambitious for our agri-food sector and we want to become the world’s highest quality food producing country, based on innovation, sustainability and family farming.

Fine Gael is committed to increasing our contribution to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on our key priorities, including CAP. Agriculture and fisheries play a larger role in Ireland than they do in many other EU Member States. Fine Gael will build on the alliances of MEPs and Member States we have already cultivated to protect and strengthen CAP into the future.

We recognise that the farming community is facing challenges, with a potential cut to the budget, the backdrop of Brexit and our ambitions on climate action. However, the CAP negotiations also present opportunities, including rebalancing power in the food chain, supporting generational renewal and vibrant rural areas, an emphasis on knowledge transfer, technology adoption and competitiveness, and new incentives for young farmers.

We are fully aware of the detrimental effects a no-deal Brexit could have on Ireland. Particular sectors such as beef are already under pressure and Fine Gael will ensure that both the EU and the Irish Government will be ready for the worst-case scenario, through supports and state aid flexibilities as needed.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Fight to retain an adequate budget for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020 that protects our farmers, is distributed fairly and targeted towards active farmers.
• Ensure the distribution of supports to farmers over the lifetime of the CAP is both fair and sustainable.
• Place young farmers – and attracting young people into farming - at the heart of our negotiating approach to the new CAP.
• Promote a new CAP programme that encourages women into the agricultural sector and the opportunities available in agri-tourism and among food producers.
• Help to develop new schemes under Pillar 2 of the next CAP to provide farm gate investment that helps the most vulnerable farmers and meets our climate objectives.
• Defend our high standards for agriculture, fisheries and food quality against low quality imports. Defend our vulnerable sectors in light of any emerging trade proposals on Mercosur, while working to develop new trade deals that are essential for Irish farmers and the wider food industry.
• Work with Commissioner Hogan and the Commission to ensure strong supports for farmers are deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit and state aid flexibilities are available as needed.
• Fight to secure the €10 billion budget for research and innovation in agriculture and food production under the new Horizon programme.
• Work with EU partners and the Irish Government to help reach our ambitious Food Wise 2025 targets of an 85% increase in the value of agri-food exports to €19 billion, a 65% increase in primary production value to €10 billion, a 70% increase in value added in the sector to over €13 billion and the creation of 23,000 additional agri-food jobs.

FISHERIES

During Fine Gael’s time in government, the Common Fisheries Policy was reformed to protect fish stocks in the interests of both fishermen and the environment. Funding for the fishing industry under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) was doubled to €240m and the first strategy for the Inshore Fisheries sector was developed. Fine Gael will continue to be strong advocates for fishermen and coastal communities in Brexit negotiations and in the development of the next Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Advocate for a strongly resourced European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) to support our fishing and coastal communities.
• Ensure Irish fishing interests are robustly defended in Brexit negotiations, working with other like-minded MEPs and Member States.
• Work with EPP colleagues to ensure the next Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) protects our valuable resources and secures the long term viability of Irish fishermen and coastal communities.

Leading on Climate Change

We want Ireland – and the EU - to be world leaders on climate action. We want to support Irish citizens to meet the demands of climate action for a fair and just transition to a low carbon economy. Through the EU’s own actions and by working with less developed parts of the world, we will ensure that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are reflected in decisions on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).

We recognise the urgency involved and we want the EU to lead on implementing the Paris Climate Agreement. We must protect our planet for future generations. This will require bold action - now - and changes to the way people live their lives.

CLIMATE

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to put in place ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2050 in key sectors such as transport, ensuring that difficult decisions are made and that they are made in a fair and inclusive manner for all citizens.
• Work with the Commission and the Council on the EU’s long-term climate strategy. We must develop a coherent EU wide policy to support a just transition.
• Support the EU’s strategy for low-emission mobility across its three priority areas of (i) increasing the efficiency of the transport system, (ii) speeding up the deployment of low emission alternative energy for transport and (iii) moving towards zero-emission vehicles.
• Take steps to ensure that the EU can facilitate the large-scale transition away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles towards electric vehicles, including a sufficient boost in the production of electric vehicles by European car manufacturers so that the decarbonisation ambitions of Member States can be reached.
• Work to develop necessary regulation and smart funding to decarbonise the EU transport sector.
• Increase the efficiency of the transport system by making the most of digital technologies, smart pricing and further encouraging the shift to lower emission transport modes.
• Promote the exchange of best practice on sustainable public transport initiatives across urban centres in Europe, such as The Urban Mobility Observatory (ELTIS).
• Build a true Energy Union, where energy flows freely across borders and which brings down citizens’ living costs.
• Promote long-term, sustained ambition on renewable energy and energy efficiency policies at EU level, including through enabling frameworks for the enhanced use of Union funds, in order to give certainty to investors and reduce the cost of capital for projects.
• Promote Ireland’s Atlantic coastline as a huge source of renewable energy through the utilisation of offshore wind. We will work to increase significantly the amount of renewables in the Irish and EU energy mix through the development of further interconnection between Ireland and other EU Member States.
• Ensure that the Midlands Region is included in the ‘Coal Regions in Transition Platform’ in the context of a commitment to an accelerated transition out of producing milled peat for power generation. The Platform will enable multi-stakeholder dialogue on how carbon intensive regions can change and facilitate the development of strategies to enable structural transformation, increased jobs and growth.
• Highlight Ireland’s work in supporting countries most vulnerable to climate change and in helping to provide a voice for those countries who struggle to attend or to make an impact at international fora. Climate Action is one of four key priorities in the Irish Government’s recently launched policy for international development, A Better World. We plan to scale up our funding on climate action up to 2030 and explore innovative approaches to climate finance, risk insurance and climate adaptation.

ENVIRONMENT

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Advocate for the adoption of a more sustainable, more circular economy. We will encourage waste prevention – reuse, repair, refurbish and recycle.
• Promote pan-European legislation to ban plastic microbeads, building on our domestic legislation.
• Strongly support the implementation of new EU legislation on Single Use Plastics (SUP), which will ban straws, cotton bud sticks made from plastic, plastic plates and cutlery, plastic coffee stirrers and plastic balloon holders.
• Develop new schemes under Pillar 2 of the next CAP that will meet our climate objectives, but also provide farm gate investment that helps the most vulnerable and disadvantaged farmers across all sectors.
• Combat air pollution, which causes almost 500,000 premature deaths in Europe every year.
• Promote the Sustainable Development Goals in the EU and beyond.

Promoting a safe and compassionate Europe

PROMOTING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW

The public consultations on the Citizens’ Dialogues on the future of Europe showed that Irish people are concerned by the apparent erosion of the rule of law in some EU Member States. If the EU is to promote our fundamental principles of democracy, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, we must ensure we uphold these principles at home. Fine Gael and our MEPs are fully committed to ensuring EU laws are enforced and the key principles of EU membership are upheld.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Re-affirm Fine Gael’s values of integrity and openness in our dealings with colleagues in the European Parliament.
• Stand up for the rights of LGBT+ and other groups that face continued discrimination within and outside the EU.
• Support the re-establishment in the next parliament of the LGBTI Intergroup that coordinates the work of MEPs in this area.
• Work to promote tolerance for ethnic and religious minorities who face discrimination and support freedom of religion or belief within and outside the EU.

SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY

Today’s criminals and terrorists are operating across borders more than ever before. Our police, security and intelligence services across Europe must work collaboratively and have access to the most up-to-date technology in order to tackle criminals and terrorists. In the current term, Fine Gael MEPs supported the EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system which empowers authorities to better track terrorists and serious criminals.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to further connect European IT databases in the areas of freedom, security and justice, in a balanced and proportionate way that respects people’s right to privacy.
• Support a strengthened EU cyber security strategy, and as part of that strategy a cyber security agency if it is aligned with Ireland’s national interests.
• Take a lead on counteracting disinformation online, especially in ensuring the integrity of the European elections. We will support the implementation of the recently agreed EU Action Plan on disinformation, which seeks to create a consolidated approach across Member States and establish a Rapid Alert System for national points of contact.
• Support increased cooperation of intelligence services to allow for a better exchange of intelligence on terrorists and potential offenders, whether they are at home or abroad, who may represent a security risk for our citizens.
• Defend the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) system and ensure it is fully implemented by Member States to strengthen security and protect our citizens, while also preserving our freedoms.

Fine Gael is opposed to the creation of an EU army. We support greater cooperation with other MEPs and Member States on security and defence matters to ensure that all our citizens are protected from new global threats such as terrorism, cyber threats and human trafficking.

We do not believe that Ireland should stand aside from engaging in international affairs due to our policy of military neutrality. Rather, through active participation we can make an effective contribution to global peace, security and development, whether that is through the EU, the UN or Ireland’s own bilateral engagement.

As part of our Global Ireland programme, we believe it is right to provide assistance in certain situations and assignments. The EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy is about promoting peace, democracy and the rule of law and our participation does not undermine our military neutrality. Our active participation in such initiatives helps us to build on our strong reputation for peacekeeping missions and make an impact internationally in keeping with our Global Ireland ambitions.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Support Ireland’s continued participation in PESCO, This provides a mechanism for developing capabilities that can assist the Defence Forces when undertaking UN-mandated peacekeeping operations and carrying out operations at home.
• Support efforts for increased collaboration and coordination so that EU Member States increase their contributions to UN peacekeeping as endorsed by the EU-UN Strategic Priorities on Peace Operations and Crisis Management (2019-2021).
• Work with European Parliament colleagues to develop an understanding of Ireland’s position on defence.

MIGRATION AND ASYLUM

Fine Gael believes that immigration from within the EU and from outside the EU is good for Ireland. Immigration has helped enrich our society, drive economic growth and staff our public services. We also appreciate that Member States need to manage migration in a balanced way to protect EU borders.

From the outset of the migration crisis in Europe, Ireland has sought to play an active role in protecting the most vulnerable and we voluntarily pledged to accept a total of 4,000 people into the State.

Fine Gael believes we should do all in our power to ensure that Operation Sophia’s search and rescue and humanitarian mandate is extended. We have real concerns about its change in

mandate and the danger that poses to the lives of vulnerable people. The value of Operation Sophia goes far beyond its formal mandate; with more than 45,000 people rescued with the help of members of the Irish Defence Forces, its value in protecting human life is immeasurable. It is an example of Ireland’s and the EU’s commitment to disrupting criminal networks, tackling the scourge of people-trafficking and protecting the lives of vulnerable migrants at sea.

Part of the solution to the ongoing migration issues lies in a renewed EU-Africa relationship, described in the next section. Ireland will continue to finance measures to address the root causes of irregular migration through humanitarian and developmental programmes in developing countries.

Fine Gael MEPs will
• Support efforts for a comprehensive approach to migration, based on a systematic, transparent and fair system, rather than the current more ad hoc approach.
• Work to reform the Common European Asylum System.
• Seek to re-establish the search and rescue and humanitarian mandate of Operation Sophia, given Ireland’s central role in recent years. Recognising the complexity of migration as a political issue in Europe, we will work to build consensus on a way forward.

MAKING AN IMPACT GLOBALLY

As set out in Global Ireland 2025, Ireland will seek to influence the global agenda through our membership of the EU. The EU is an important actor on the world stage and Ireland’s voice is amplified within EU structures. In the European Parliament, delegations provide a forum for MEPs to make links with parliamentarians and representatives from across the world. This is an opportunity to promote human rights and democratic values beyond EU borders.

In the past few years, the Irish Government has increased Ireland’s contribution to the EU’s Emergency Trust Fund for Africa from €3 million to €6 million to €15 million today. This fund addresses the root causes of destabilisation, forced displacement and irregular migration in Africa and helps those communities most affected by, but least equipped to tackle, the effects of climate change.

Fine Gael believes a more intensive and meaningful EU-Africa partnership is required if we are to deal effectively with our shared challenges. We want to move beyond our traditional focus on aid towards building new multi-faceted partnerships with a young, fast-growing African continent, encompassing trade, security and education. This relationship must be one based on mutual respect and which, through partnership, helps the two continents deal with the multiple challenges of climate change, the economy, food security, energy security, water security, migration, corruption, and regional conflict.

Ireland’s new policy for international development, A Better World, outlines how we will help those furthest behind to overcome the challenges they face, including climate change. We spend tens of millions of euro each year on climate action internationally and that work will be strengthened as part of A Better World.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work towards a more meaningful and multi-faceted EU-Africa partnership.
• Seek to establish a new political structure to facilitate much closer political cooperation and two-way investment between Africa and the EU, reflecting the breadth of challenges and opportunities - such as rapid population growth – we will face over the coming decades.
• Support the implementation of Ireland’s new policy on development aid, A Better World, in conjunction with the European Consensus on Development, which aligns our development policy with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
• Advance the EU Global Strategy, which sets out how we can contribute to a more peaceful, equal and sustainable world.
• Promote respect for human rights in relations with countries outside the EU.
• Play an active role in EU efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in crisis situations.
• Support further accession to the EU for countries that meet the necessary criteria in line with EU values. We recognise the importance of accession for many countries neighbouring the EU, especially given Ireland’s own positive experience of EU membership.
• Oppose any proposals for Qualified Majority Voting on foreign policy.
• Work with fellow MEPs and other Member States towards the creation of a two-state solution as part of a lasting settlement in the Middle East.
• Support the EU strategic approach to international cultural relations and the new ‘framework for action’ to ensure the role of culture informs all decision-making. The EU can strengthen its effectiveness and the impact of its foreign policy by integrating international cultural relations.
",2019,"EP","Fine Gael","Fine Gael_2019_EP"
"EP 2019: Green Party","OUR VISION

The Green Party believes in Europe.

The Green Party believes in Europe. In union with our sister Green Parties around the EU we believe that through reform and development the European project can deliver a society that places social equality and climate justice at the heart of its work. We believe in a union of goals and principles, not for financial gains for the few, but in economic and social progress for all.

A union that leads the world by protecting people and the planet. Now is the time to fulfil that promise. Now is the time for the Greens. We are a truly European movement united by our vision, mission and passion.

From Ireland to Georgia, from Norway to Malta, we fight for human dignity, sustainability, equality, peace and solidarity.

We do it in the parliaments, we do it on the streets and we do it in our communities.

THE CHALLENGES

We know that today Europe faces some of the greatest challenges in its history. New, politically extreme groups, using aggressive tactics and the temptation of hatred to trick and force their way into power are gaining ground while politicians who promote the status quo are failing to enact real change.

The idea of the European Union as a project for peace and social justice can seem remote at times.

Our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom, has decided to leave the European Union, and other forces want to weaken it. Authoritarianism, racism, terrorism and the threat of further economic uncertainty have eroded the sense of security for many Europeans.

The financial crisis and austerity policies left millions in poverty, while big multinational corporations avoid taxes. People fleeing war and persecution exposed governments unwilling to help, while Europe as a whole is wealthier than ever. The climate crisis threatens to rapidly undo the very foundations on which we build and develop our communities.

Never before has Europe needed the clear, fair and ambitous voice of green politics.

Now is the time for action.

THE WAY FORWARD

The Green Party is working towards a democratic and inclusive Europe that is socially just and environmentally sustainable. We need an economy that serves both current and future generations. We need a Europe that bears its global responsibility and leaves no one behind.

The European Union is far from perfect but it can be a powerful force for good.

We can build on what has been achieved – and change what has not worked. We know that remaking Europe will not be easy. We are committed to working hard every day with people, organisations and movements fighting for change across the continent, and our support is growing.

Over the years, our persistent work has delivered many successes. With the Greens playing a leading role, Europe has taken important steps to invest in renewable energy, secure people’s privacy online, improve recycling, and ban harmful pesticides.

Thanks to Green leadership, Europe is moving towards protecting whistleblowers who expose information in the public interest, taking action against authoritarian governments, banning unnecessary plastics, and fighting tax evasion by big corporations – just to give a few examples.

A vote for the Greens makes a real difference. Join us - It is time to renew the promise of Europe.

THE RIGHT TO INHERIT A LIVABLE PLANET

We believe in a Europe that leads the world in a just transition to sustainable societies. Greening our economy is an historic opportunity to create jobs and improve our quality of life while making sure no one is left behind. Climate crisis, destruction of nature and overuse of resources threaten the foundations of our well-being and wealth – even our security. Human progress can only take place within planetary boundaries.

Europe has to lead the way on climate action, making the Paris Agreement a reality. We want the EU to pursue all possible efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

• Carbon.
We are calling for a European climate law, with binding carbon budgets reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and building a net-zero emissions economy. This must include restoring natural carbon sinks in forests and soils.

• Energy.
Not a single euro from taxpayers should finance fossil fuels.
Europe must phase out coal by 2030 and other fossil fuels, including gas, as soon as possible thereafter. Nuclear power and fracking have no role to play in the clean energy future.

• Waste.
Non-recyclable plastics must be taxed or banned, sustainable alternatives developed, and recycling and reuse targets raised. We propose strict limits on exporting waste and the introduction of taxes on the extraction and import of raw materials.

TRANSPORT

Building a sustainable transport system requires vision and commitment:

Investing in railways, connecting European countries and regions with more accessible and affordable infrastructure, focusing funding and effort on sustainable and active travel.

Overall, stronger public transportation as well as reducing the necessity for transport can remedy traffic congestion and pollution across Europe.

• Ban on Fossil-Fuel Cars.
We propose that no new fossil-fuel cars be sold in Europe after 2030. The Union must support the creation of low-emission zones in towns and cities across Europe and promote cycling and walking.

• Funds.
Funding for sustainable transport must be redirected from subsidies for air travel through the introduction of a European flight tax, European VAT on tickets as well as ending the kerosene tax exemption for airplanes.

PROTECTING NATURE ON LAND AND AT SEA

Determined action on the environment can improve the lives of millions of Europeans. Today, air pollution alone causes more than 400,000 early deaths every year in the EU – and weakens the quality of life for millions more. The seas around Europe are choking with plastic and our natural world is in crisis as species struggle against pollution and habitat destruction. The Green Party have fought long and hard to protect our natural world.

• Protected Areas. 
We propose to expand protected areas significantly, ensure they cover key ecosystems, and guarantee that the protection promised them in law really works.

• Forestry. 
We propose stronger tools to address deforestation related to land management, imported food and other products.

• Marine Areas. 
We want to increase marine protected areas to 20% of our seas. Controls of sulphur emissions from shipping must be extend ed to all coasts and heavy fuel oil banned in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.

• Fish Stocks. 
Fishing seasonal closures allowing fish stocks to recover should be complied with by all Member States. Illegal fishing must be stopped and any fish imported from outside the single market must meet European conservation standards.

• Trawling.
We propose to end deep-sea bottom trawling and other particularly destructive forms of industrial fishing and limit the impact of bottom-contact fisheries on eco-systems.

ECONOMY

Our current economy is based on taking resources from nature, making products, using them and then throwing them away. This linear model must be replaced with a circular economy, creating more value and using fewer resources, while making sure this does not lead to more hazardous substances. Instead of continuously consuming more resources, we need to consume smarter and in moderation.

• Circular Economy. 
We propose encourage manufacturers to create products that last longer, to promote repair and ‘first fix free’ strategies. We also propose increasing the duration of warranties to combat planned obsolescence.

• A Caring Economy. 
As demographics change and we move towards circular economies we believe an opportuntity exists to build a society that is more fair, social, collaborative. New forms of economy can combine profitability with social inclusion and democratic governance. European regulation should enable alternative tools, such as cooperatives, crowdfunding and social entrepreneurship.

• GDP. 
Gross domestic product alone is an inadequate measure of economic progress. We want to complement it with alternative metrics that reflect social and environmental concerns.

• Digital Sector. 
We call for an effective and independent EU authority for digital sector supervision in order to control and limit the market power of big corporations.

• SMEs. 
Smarter regulation should guarantee SMEs a fair playing field with big companies and competition regulation must be reformed accordingly.

• Buying Power. 
More sustainable public procurement can be a driving force to green the economy. We want a more systematic use of social, environmental and fair-trade criteria when public bodies buy products and services.

• Trade. 
We will continue to work for open and fair-trade policies, provided they are based on international rules, transparent processes and that they enhance – not endanger – the rights of workers, farmers and consumers, animal welfare and the protection of health and the environment.

• Negotiations. 
We favour progress in the WTO and multilateral agreements over bilateral trade deals. The Paris Agreement, international labour standards rules and Sustainable Development Goals must form the foundation of trade treaties.

• Tax. 
We propose ecological tax reform: taxing more what we want less of (resource use and pollution) and taxing less what we want more of (jobs). Europe should require Member States to raise taxes on fossil fuels and consider environmental taxes at the European level, for example on flights and plastics.

• Transparency. 
We propose to introduce stronger measures to combat market manipulation and improve transparency on the financial markets. We propose a financial transaction tax to limit speculation and to finance sustainable investments.

• Tax Justice. 
Europe must take stronger measures to close tax havens, fight evasion and tax avoidance, both outside and inside the Union. More harmonisation on what is taxed and how, such as a strong common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) for large companies and a minimum corporate tax rate, would reduce harmful competition between Member States.

Beyond committing to this common framework, Member States should retain the ability to address inherent disadvantages in their economies.

Benefits emanating from the reduction of tax avoidance should in turn also be utilised for European investments to decrease social inequality and support disadvantaged and peripheral communities.

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE

The way we produce and consume food makes a big difference to our health, environment and animals.

We want to reform Europe’s common agricultural policy to move from industrial agriculture to sustainable forms of farming, such as organic and agro-ecological solutions.

Sustainable agriculture helps cut emissions, save bees, revitalise rural communities and keep our food safe.
• Farming. We propose to redirect agricultural subsidies to sustainable farming, based on fair and results-based conditions that protect small to medium farmers and focus on land management.
• Pesticides. We propose that harmful pesticides such as glyphosate, and similar equals, should be banned.
• Reducing Meat Consumption. In conjunction with sustainable land use we propose to support farmers to expand their output profile and increase the production of non meat based products.
• Animal Welfare. Animals have the right to live free from abuse, which is why we are calling for a ban on fur farming and transporting live animals long distances.

SOCIAL EQUALITY

We want to build a Europe that offers everyone a fair chance, with a sustainable economy and tax justice. Everyone in Europe should have the right to a decent income and basic public services.

We believe that the EU must urgently reform the economic system so that it works for the people and respects our planetary boundaries. Environmental damage often disproportionately impacts those who are already struggling, not to mention future generations. The Green Party will work for fairness and equality.
• Just Transistion. A special European scheme should be set up to finance retraining and moving to new jobs, providing social security and alleviating fears.
• Poverty. We reject austerity measures that have resulted in increasing poverty and deteriorating public services.
• Basic Income. To make the European Pillar of Social Rights a reality, we call for introducing European legislation to secure adequate minimum income schemes in all European countries.
• Housing. Public investments in social, affordable and energy-efficient housing should be supported with European funds.
• Tenancy Rights. We believe in nationally funded, locally delivered approach towards public housing policy and that we must protect those who rent properties from exploitation. Every person must have their right to a home recognised by national governement.
• Health. The EU should support Member States to achieve universal health coverage, reduce health inequalities and ensure access to medicines. We want more focus on preventing both physical and mental health problems, not just treating them.
• Access to Medicines. Drug policy needs to be based on evidence, not prejudice. European countries should reform drug policies to help – not punish – people suffering from substance abuse.
• Disablity. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities must be implemented and audited by all member states at both a local and national level.
• Access to Services. People with disabilities must be included in decisions which concern them, including having full access to voting. All public services, including transport should be accessible to all.

WORK

Work can provide income, community and purpose. To create quality jobs and prepare job-seekers for them, a wide range of measures is needed from both businesses and society, from retraining and upskilling to supporting social entrepreneurship and setting up small businesses.
• Labour Rights.
We support the right of workers to organise in trade unions as well as collective bargaining, social dialogue and worker participation.

• Gig Economy.
We propose to update labour rules and welfare regimes so that they recognise the changing nature of work, also protecting self-employed people and workers in the gig and platform economy.

• Flexible Working.
In response to the changing nature of work we propose that to introduce employer guidelines to support reducing and redistributing working hours when requested.

• Corporate Responsibility.
The Union and Member States must introduce rules to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – and guarantee people access to justice when companies break these rules.

EDUCATION AND RESEARCH

Education is a tool for people to improve their lives, understand the world and engage in society. It is also an investment in the future as educated and skilled people are the foundation of both a vibrant economy and functioning democracy. We want to make Europe the world leader in both education and research.

• A Vision for Education.
Our long-term vision is free and accessible education for all to reduce education inequality.

• Research.
We propose to increase funding for independent research and innovation considerably to meet big societal challenges, following the success of the Horizon 2020 programme.

• Erasmus.
The Erasmus+ exchange must be broadened and strengthened to really enable people from all backgrounds to work, train or study in another country.

GENERATIONAL EQUALITY

Years after the financial crisis, young Europeans continue to face a number of challenges. In some countries, youth unemployment is still as high as 40% (Spain, Greece). Many feel understandable anxiety about the future, witnessing the inaction by status-quo politicians. In parallel the proportion of older people is rising rapidly. Senior Europeans have a lot to offer, from passing on experience at work to volunteering in civil society, which should lead to some sort of recognition. No one should need to live in poverty because they have retired.

• Equality.
We propose an end to age related banding in social payments for younger people, quality jobs, a ban on discriminatory youth wages and proper pay for internships.

• Youth Guarantee.
The Youth Guarantee should be made mandatory for all Member States; making the guarantee of stable, paid and quality employment its primary goal.

• Volunteering.
We call for sufficient funding for the volunteering strand of the European Solidarity Corps that gives young people the opportunity and the financial means to develop their own volunteering projects.

• Mature Learning.
Senior workers must have the right to lifelong learning. People should be allowed to retire flexibly, for example by combining reduced working hours with part-time pensions.

DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM

Democracy, the rule of law and human rights have been increasingly challenged both within Europe and internationally. In these troubled times, Europe can be a beacon of hope.

The Union must play a stronger role in defending and deepening the foundations of open societies. We want a vibrant democracy on all levels:

From local to regional, national, European and international.

• Protection.
We propose to increase support for investigative journalism and defend journalists under threat. Whistle-blowers – people exposing information in the public interest – must be vigorously protected.

• Net Neutrality.
We defend net neutrality – the principle that all data must be treated equally – as a foundation of the open internet.

• Data Protection.
Recently introduced European data protection rules must be fully implemented. Electronical communication has to be end-to-end encrypted. We strongly reject any kind of data retention without cause.

• Voting Age.
We propose setting the age of voting and candidacy at 16 years in the European elections. This would give youth a stronger voice in making decisions that shape our common future.

• Participation.
We propose to radically increase transparency in European institutions, including the European Central Bank. All positions taken by Member States in the Council should be made public. We propose a mandatory legislative footprint for EU laws and a binding lobby register for all EU institutions.

• Migration.
Europe must establish legal and safe channels for migration.

We reject any plans for controlled centres or regional disembarkation platforms outside of the EU.

• International Solidarity.
Europe needs to increase funding for international development and humanitarian action. Member states should allocate at least 0.7% of their economy to supporting people in need abroad. The Sustainable Development Goals provide a good blueprint for EU activities.

• Peace.
We oppose redirecting European funds towards military purposes. Lasting security and stability cannot be built with weapons.
We call for a ban on arms exports. To maintain peace, Europe also needs a common security and defence policy.

• Monetary Policy.
The EU needs a substantially more ambitious and effective budget to fulfil its tasks, co-decided by the European Parliament. We call on the Union to explore participatory budgeting, allowing people to have a direct say in how a part of their money is used.

• Reform.
The intergovernmental structures of the euro-zone, such as the Fiscal Compact and European Stability Mechanism (ESM), must be profoundly reformed and integrated into the EU.

"EP 2019: Labour","Foreword

The 2019 European Parliament elections are critically important for Ireland’s future and the future direction of the European project. Labour is offering three of our best as candidates for the European Parliament.

Labour and our allies want a Social Europe that recognises the failings of the current model and dedicates itself to improving people’s lives. European workers need a pay rise, after years of wages not keeping pace with economic growth, and they need public investment to restore health care, education and other public services that have been deprived of money for far too long.

Europe needs to engage in a massive programme of investment to improve aging infrastructure and to reverse the growth of inequality that is alienating millions of people from the benefits of European co-operation.

Our track record is one of strengthening workers’ rights, fighting for better pay and conditions, and supporting sustainable growth in the economy.

Labour’s particular focus at this critical time is to protect Irish people’s jobs and livelihoods from the effects of the UK leaving the European Union. We also want decisive action on climate change. And Labour’s group in Europe is committed to using European funding to help build more affordable public housing in Ireland.

Democracy in Europe is under threat from both the conservative ideology of free markets and from the extremist parties who exploit people’s anger but provide no real solutions. The rightwing groups in the European Parliament, including those of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, offer cold-blooded market solutions whereas Labour parties are concerned to meet people’s human needs.

Labour wants a Social Europe based on equality and fairness, with a stronger role for the State to counterbalance the market and to better regulate private corporations.

In 2019, the Irish and other European people will together decide if they want more of the same from the conservatives who currently dominate Europe, or if they want to help Labour and its sister parties to build a truly Social Europe.

1. Limiting the Harm from Brexit

Labour’s first priority is to protect people’s jobs and livelihoods. Decisions at EU level will be very important to help Ireland overcome the economic challenges of Brexit, especially for jobs and businesses that export to the UK or rely on the UK as a source of raw materials.

While our preference was always for the UK to stay in the EU (or to re-join), we have also pursued practical measures to protect jobs and businesses from the damaging effects of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.

HOW WE CAN LIMIT THE EFFECT OF BREXIT ON IRELAND:

We will always ensure the Good Friday Agreement is protected

Labour MEPs will champion the Good Friday Agreement at European level. We will continue to outline the unique circumstances on our island and ensure that Brexit does not prevent the free movement of people and businesses’ activity in Ireland

EU PEACE funding, which helps reinforce peaceful community relations, needs to be continued in Northern Ireland

Irish workers and businesses that are affected by Brexit need real support from Government and the European Union

Labour fully supports the call of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to allocate at least €500 million to deal with the negative consequences of Brexit. This will help stop businesses from going under and help prevent job losses, such as through financial support for short-time work schemes

Measures need to be put in place to protect sectors that are most vulnerable to Brexit. The agri-food, fisheries, tourism, transport and retail sectors all need specific plans to help them thrive in a post-Brexit environment. To do this we need flexibility on State Aid limits on public funding for those sectors that are hardest hit

We will insist that changes are made to the EU Globalisation Fund to ensure Irish workers affected negatively by Brexit can access financial and up-skilling supports

We need to ensure that additional supports are available to farmers and workers in agri-food industries and fisheries, through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)

We will continue to support and seek expansion of the EU’s Structural and Investment Funds in the period 2021-27, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and renewal of Horizon 2020 investment in science and technology

European Union funding and support is needed for the development of more direct transport links between Ireland and continental Europe. This must include ferry services, so we can reduce Ireland’s heavy reliance on haulage and freight that crosses Britain

People who work in Irish fisheries need enhanced protections as some EU members may look for more access to Irish waters if there is a loss of access to fishing in British waters

Irish exporters will need extra help to replace UK markets with markets inside the EU, and to enhance Irish trading and cultural links with other EU members, including trading via the Internet

Labour MEPs will look for a supports package to enhance maritime industry and ports, and regional airports and public transport, and to assist the development of rural broadband, renewable energy and connectivity to European electricity grids

Labour will insist on an open Irish border

The Labour Party is fully behind continued EU support for an open border on the island of Ireland

European Union rules need to be flexible to support existing businesses engaged in cross-border trade on our island. We need to make it as simple as possible for people to do business, with as little paperwork as possible

The EU must recognise the mutual rights of Irish and UK citizens as part of the Common Travel Area – including the rights of Irish citizens who are living in the UK and British citizens who livehere in Ireland – especially if there is a no withdrawal agreement between the EU and UK

Labour MEPs will demand that Irish citizens’ EU rights – including social security and pension entitlements, and recognition of educational qualifications of those living in Northern Ireland and Britain – are fully protected after Brexit

The EU and the UK need to have a good working relationship in the future. Irish Labour MEPs would be well placed to promote this

If there is no second Brexit referendum held in the UK, then we need to ensure that any future relationship the EU has with the UK is as close as possible to one where Britain is a member of the Single Market and Customs Union

We will fully back any initiative from a future UK government for the UK to re-join the EU

It is vital that we continuously monitor how Brexit will impact wages and working conditions. If the UK engages in a race-to-the-bottom economic model, Labour MEPs will insist on measures in any future EU-UK trade agreement to counter-act any move to drive down wages in Ireland as a result of the UK’s trade policies

Under no circumstances should Ireland be exposed to low standard consumer products or food (such as chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef) which may be permitted into the UK market after Brexit

With our colleagues in the trade union movement, Labour MEPs will seek to ensure that the UK at least keeps the equivalent of EU standards into the future when it comes to important areas such as workers’ rights, consumer protection and for the environment

There needs to be continued EU funding for Ireland and Northern Ireland

European Regional Development Funding has benefitted so many rural communities in Ireland. We need to make sure that this funding stream continues

We will advocate for EU funding programmes in Northern Ireland to be maintained post-Brexit, particularly the PEACE IV and INTERREG VA programmes

2. Leadership on 19 Climate Action

Labour believes that meaningful co-ordination and co-operation at EU level is essential so that all member states, including Ireland, can meet our obligations to reduce carbon emissions in time to limit the devastating effects of climate change.

The EU as a whole emitted 4,441 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018. Our collective commitment is to reduce that to net zero by 2050, which is incredibly ambitious, although the EU is making progress in that direction and has been a champion of the Paris Agreement on climate change on the world stage.

Alongside the serious challenges and risks of climate change, there are opportunities too. Europe has the technological capacity to research and develop ways to reduce the extent of climate change, and to achieve a Just Transition where we train our workers to adapt to new, sustainable jobs and new technology in the workplace. Done right, a Social Europe can be a world leader of a Green New Deal for job creation and sustainable economics.

HOW WE CAN STOP CLIMATE CHAOS:

Labour representatives both at home and in Europe will be at the forefront of taking serious action on climate

The European Union must make fighting climate change for the benefit of future generations one of its main priorities, alongside greater social justice and solidarity

Having signed the Paris Agreement on climate change on behalf of Ireland, the Labour Party will demand that the EU’s climate ambition is at the very least in line with the Paris Agreement and the latest science, with the aim of becoming climate-neutral by 2050 at the latest

Labour supports the creation of an EU Sustainable Development Pact that promotes strict social and ecological targets alongside economic aims

We will get behind EU-level strategies, budgets and performance indicators to drive the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Agenda and Goals by 2030

It is incredibly important that children and young people are involved in any kind of Europe-wide consultation on how we can reduce the impact that climate change is having. Labour MEPs will ensure that young people get their say in how we can protect our planet from further damage

We will push for agencies, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank, to be given a greater role to invest in support of meeting the EU’s climate change targets and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals

The Labour Party is a strong believer in the need for additional investment in clean energy. That is why we will look for additional EU support and funding for the ambitious development of affordable clean energy, particularly wind and solar power, and the interconnection of national electricity networks

Additional support is needed from the European Union to speed up the development of affordable electric vehicles. Working with Labour Councillors, Labour MEPs will push for funding for the necessary infrastructure for electric vehicle charging

It is time for Europe to prepare for a Just Transition for workers who will be affected by climate change. Europe needs to take calls for a Green New Deal seriously

The Labour Party will campaign for the EU to set up Just Transition Funds for training and new job creation, to assist workers affected by the necessary changes towards a low carbon economy, such as in the midlands, and to help prepare our industries and workers so they benefit from the green transition

We will support the taxing of greenhouse gases in a socially fair way, making polluters pay and using the funds to directly assist lower income households to overcome energy poverty and to make home retrofitting, clean technology and electric vehicles more affordable

It is clear that the EU needs stronger environmental policies

There needs to be greater consistency and cooperation when it comes to upholding environmental standards across the EU. This can be done with strong legislation across member states

There needs to be greater support from the EU on recycling, particularly recycling plastic. Labour MEPs will work to push for better laws on reducing nonbiodegradable packaging and will support waste reduction measures like bottle and container deposit schemes

We support including sustainable production methods, better nutrition, targets for reduced food waste, better animal welfare, climate protection and the preservation of biodiversity in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)

The CAP must be progressive and focused on the future. It must promote sustainable land management and small-scale farming

We will work to find measures to protect nature and to ensure we preserve Europe’s diverse plant and animal species

We will continue to support measures at EU level to curb pollution of the air, water and soil, with strong protection for workers potentially exposed to toxins

3. Greater European Support 19 for Public Housing

Labour’s view is that the State must provide affordable public housing, and we will work to enhance European supports for a state-led resolution of Ireland’s housing affordability crisis. All around Europe, cities and other public authorities build and provide quality public housing that is affordable and available to all. In some European cities more than half the population rents high quality public housing. Public housing can and should be a much more prevalent option in Ireland too.

Housing is recognised as a fundamental right in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which has been ratified by all EU member states (including Ireland in 1989). The provision of housing is and should always be a public good, not a commodity for market speculation.

Frans Timmermans (currently First Vice-President of the European Commission and the candidate of Labour’s group in the European Parliament) has pledged to allocate EU structural funds to match spending by municipalities on public housing if he is elected as the next President of the European Commission.

HOW WE CAN GET GREATER SUPPORT FROM THE EU FOR PUBLIC HOUSING:

The European Union needs stronger rules to support public housing

Labour MEPs will work with all parties in the European Parliament to facilitate the State provision of quality, sustainable public housing

We will look to change, if needed, any EU rules that diminish the State’s ability to provide public housing and seek reforms to EU State Aid rules to ensure essential public needs like housing can always be met by State action in the economy

We will make sure that European rules and supports for the return of residential services by public authorities (such as waste collection or water) to public control

We strongly believe that the European Union must provide significant funding for public housing

The European Structural and Investment Funds and the European Investment Bank must provide funding for public housing.

Labour TDs and MEPs will demand that more flexibility about how investment in public housing is treated in relation to national debt and compliance with EU budgetary rules

We are in favour of a single EU market for housing finance, to help drive down construction and mortgage costs

We will look for money to be invested to create a EU-wide plan for Affordable Housing and Clean Public Transport, with co-ordination between EU structural funds and EIB funding

The Labour Party will promote rules for universal design in housing and to ensure that neighbourhoods are fully accessible to people with sensory and mobility disabilities

As our populations gets older, we will look to the EU to provide policies that promote better housing and living standards for older people

4. Supporting Workers’ Rights, 19 Jobs and Enterprise

Labour and our sister parties across Europe are leading the fight to restore a Social Europe, through initiatives like the elimination of zero-hours contracts and bogus self-employment, and stronger measures to support workers whose jobs are at risk of being displaced by new technology.

Across Europe, the share of national income going to workers has declined in recent decades. The numbers of working poor are on the rise and people are at risk of poverty because prices are increasing, hourly contract jobs in the “gig economy” are more insecure, and public services are being reduced and starved of funding. There is an urgent need for wages across Europe to rise, with faster wage rises needed in the countries with lower pay. There is a persistent gender pay gap across Europe that must be closed. All of this would boost demand, enable sustainable and inclusive growth, reduce in-work poverty and reduce inequalities.

The European Union, in the past, was led by socialists and social democrats, and as a result ensured higher standards of worker protection than existed in the United States or other major economies. However, as technology and the nature of work have changed, and as the EU has become more dominated by right-wing governments across Europe, rules to protect workers have not kept pace, and the EU has become narrowly focused on deregulation, market liberalisation and competition law. We need Labour parties to be stronger in the European Parliament, and in member states, to force economic policies to go in a new direction.

HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN SUPPORT WORKERS’ RIGHTS, JOB CREATION AND ENTERPRISE:

There needs to be sufficient investment to create good quality, sustainable jobs in Ireland and across Europe

Labour representatives will campaign for a long-term EU Investment Plan that supports regional development, State industries, infrastructure, research and innovation, training and life-long learning. The ultimate goal of this plan would be creating the conditions for quality jobs that are sustainable in the context of the green transition, the digital revolution and the growth of artificial intelligence

We will seek investment to help integrate people with disabilities into the workforce

In a race-to-the-bottom economy where precarious work is becoming the norm, workers’ rights must be protected and strengthened

Working with our sister parties across Europe, we will demand stronger European rules that uphold and promote the right of workers and trade unions to engage in collective bargaining, including a Framework Directive entitling every worker in Europe to the right to be represented by a trade union in negotiations with their employer on their pay and terms of employment, if they so wish, and ensure employers must engage with trade unions

The new European Labour Authority needs to be a body with proper teeth when it comes to protecting workers. That’s why Labour will call for it to have strong powers to prevent social dumping and to promote fair labour mobility

Workers who are in precarious work in the gig economy or are contracted into dodgy bogus self-employment arrangements need to have better protections. This can be achieved by building on the recently agreed European Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions

There needs to be an EU-wide definition of “work” and “worker” to help underpin legal protections for people involved in new forms of precarious work and other paid activity in the gig economy

The Labour Party will make sure that there is proper implementation of common EU rules for all workers to have written contracts in a language they understand, and for fair salaries, wit a ban on zero-hours contracts and bogus self-employment

We will seek binding EU rules to require employers to give workers a minimum level of pension cover, and we will seek EU standards on the quality and security of pensions, including measures to curb the creeping extension of retirement ages, especially for manual workers

There needs to be greater enforcement of rules on the recognition of European workers’ qualifications, including the qualifications of workers with a disability

We will call for the participation of workers, such as in European Works Councils

Labour will campaign for a European floor of workers’ rights

The adequacy of European law when it comes to Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation and robotics needs to be reviewed

We will explore the possibility of taxation on robots/AI where they are displacing jobs

We believe that workers should have a right to retrain if their jobs are replaced by technology

There needs to be greater protection for workers against excessive scrutiny, including electronic scrutiny, and the unfair pressure of unreasonable work targets

Labour MEPs will back proposals to alter European rules to support workers’ right to disconnect outside of working hours, in a context where email and other work activity has encroached into people’s private time and is unremunerated

Working with our colleagues in the trade union movement, we will promote the merits of a four-day working week or six-hour day (without loss of pay) to counter-balance the growing amount of required work done outside of regular hours, such as work done at home or through mobile devices

Building on the recently agreed European directive on work-life balance, there needs to be improvements to work-life balance for parents and carers, including equal status between part-time workers and full-time workers, and Labour will promote EU rules to enhance flexibility about working hours, to allow families to manage caring responsibilities without their career progression or incomes being penalised

We will strengthen Social Europe and the social dimension of European policy by supporting more Qualified Majority Voting by member states on matters relating to anti-discrimination, social security and social protection of workers, the protection of workers who are made redundant, workers’ and employer’s representation, and employment conditions for third-country nationals

It’s time to reform the Eurozone

There needs to be real and meaningful change to European fiscal rules. We will advocate for the revision of the Fiscal Compact Treaty to ensure that States can always take strong action in the event of high unemployment or other economic crises, including climate change

As part of our contributions to the design of the European budget, we will put forward ways that will make sure that low pay and precarious work are better addressed by the EU

We will amend the basic mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB), so that it must base its decisions on the need to reduce unemployment as well as to maintain a low level of inflation

The ECB inflation target needs to average 2-3%, rather than be rigidly set below 2%

We will call for structural and institutional changes of the ECB to make it more democratically accountable

We believe that there needs to be a review of the ECB’s ability to issue bonds to assist States to better manage their debt levels and to attain lower cost borrowing, and to assist private banks for special categories of investment such as retraining, start-ups, social housing and climate change

There must be greater equality for all workers

Working people deserve a pay rise, especially those on low pay. Working with our sister parties in the Party of European Socialists we will work to reverse the recent trend where the share of economic growth going to workers has declined

We need a mature discussion across Europe about implementing an EU wide living wage policy that would benefit all workers. This would provide a higher social floor for minimum wages that would guarantee workers a decent standard of living

The EU must make resources available to aid a national action plan to revitalise our towns. This will advance economic and community development, and enhance employment, public services and quality of life

We will seek additional European investment to provide high quality, affordable early years education and care services, provided by better paid workers, so that all children have access to high quality services and so that parents can take up employment

Labour MEPs will be at the centre of the campaign for a renewed European

Maternity Directive, to include statutory provision of one year’s leave and minimum payments aligned to existing salary, alongside more comprehensive general parental leave to allow a greater sharing of parenting

The rules around wages need to change. That’s why we will demand enforcement of stronger EU rules on equal wages for the same job being done in the same place, such as in construction and in maritime work, and advocate for the use of European registration cards and/or Safe Pass schemes to ensure all workers are paid equally, and insist on tighter rules on the reflagging of ships to prevent inequalities of pay and conditions for workers doing the same jobs

We will work towards a European Social Action Plan

We believe that the European Pillar of Social Rights should be transformed into binding rules that strengthen welfare systems, respect labour market models and improve living standards

Labour will call for a specific funding strand within the next round European Social Funds Plus (ESF+) (2021-2027) to support the implementation of an EU Social Action Plan

There must be minimum standards of social protection and welfare across Europe.

We will push to raise welfare rates and standards across member states, with the aim of developing a European minimum income guarantee

In the event of a rapid increase in unemployment, we will seek an EU-level unemployment insurance mechanism, to support member states

Following the work of Labour in the European Parliament in the past we will look to extend the Youth Guarantee of a job, traineeship or education, to ensure full employment for young people and to reduce social exclusion. We will promote voucher schemes (European Cultur Cheques) that support young people’s access to culture

There must be protections for interns, trainees and apprentices to eradicate the exploitation of younger workers, and a greater range of apprenticeship options, linked to industry, for young people leaving secondary school

Labour MEPs will work to establish a European Skills Guarantee, so that people who are unemployed will have guaranteed access to training to help them acquire the skills they need for re-employment and social inclusion

Support reinforcement of Erasmus 2021-27 and seek for it to benefit people from all social backgrounds by extending it to all post-secondary education, training and apprenticeships

We must end tax evasion

There has to be a common European approach to prevent tax evasion by big corporations and to avoid member states being played against one another by multinationals engaged in aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance

The Labour Party is in favour of digital taxation and Financial Transaction Tax at European level

We will defend Ireland’s autonomy in relation to tax policy, while actively supporting EU measures to close tax loopholes and to ensure corporations pay their fair share of taxes

5. Improving Quality of Life for All

Labour – and the Party of European Socialists – has prioritised social justice, especially for all children and families. Labour will take practical steps to reduce poverty at local, national and European level, so that every child has a decent start in life.

One in four children are at risk of poverty across the EU, including in Ireland, with all that implies in terms of missed opportunities to learn and develop in childhood, and the risk of personal and social problems later in life.

Decent healthcare, social protection, housing and education are issues that people care deeply about. While the EU has limited powers in these social areas, it does have influence. We will make sure that the EU’s influence in social policy is a force for good.

HOW A SOCIALIST EUROPEAN UNION WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL:

We believe that there needs to be a new Social Contract for Europe

Labour and our sister parties from across Europe will provide the necessary leadership by demanding a Social Europe that will prioritise equality, poverty reduction, the creation of quality jobs, security in old age, supports for people with disabilities and the best possible start for all children

We will make sure that EU economic policy focuses on the elimination of poverty and social exclusion with binding targets and fines for non-compliance. There must be a focus on eliminating inter-generational poverty and social exclusion by enhancing people’s opportunities

Labour MEPs will represent urban and rural areas. That is why we will call for a much greater economic balance between rural and urban areas, such as through investment in rural transport and broadband

We will demand a fair start for every child

We’ll demand that the EU prioritises the elimination of child poverty as part of

its prioritisation of social justice and solidarity, with binding targets and monitoring of performance across member states

The rights of children must be recognised. That is why we want to see a European Child Guarantee that recognises the rights of a child, with the aim that every child would be free from abuse and have access to quality healthcare, childcare, education, housing and healthy meals

We will look to extend EU funding to support the rapid diagnosis and treatment/ support for children with disabilities to limit their loss of educational attainment and life opportunities

Labour will work to extend EU funding to organisations who are involved in promoting the uptake of breastfeeding, while seeking stricter rules on the advertising of replacement products

We will provide extra support to European workers’ families

There needs to be extra protections to assist transnational families; for example, ensuring leave opportunities to care for a family member in another country

We will call for it to be easier for children to move schools between member states

There must be additional measures to support inter-culturalism in mixed areas

Labour supports social innovation

We will support the development of social innovation in the European economy, and provide new opportunities for co-operatives, social enterprises and non-profit organisations to promote new solutions to meet people’s needs

We’ll seek increased EU funding and supports from the EIB for start-ups, SMEs, community organisations, and municipal authorities that seek to resolve social problems

We’ll seek EU supports for structures that facilitate greater co-operation between public authorities and private organisations seeking to resolve social problems, including incubators and innovation hubs operating at local level

In a Social Europe, there must be shared European public services

There must be a role for European funding of public healthcare and social security, building on the Youth Guarantee model

The Labour Party completely supports healthcare provision for all and for the provision of vaccines. We will seek a European minimum standard of guaranteed healthcare for all, including cancer screening programmes and availability of the HPV vaccine to all children

There must be further development of shared healthcare services of a highly specialised nature, where the populations of smaller member states would not be large enough to develop them in isolation, such as for very specialised surgical procedures, the development of “orphan drugs”, and treatment for rare diseases and genetic disorders

Labour MEPs will ensure that there is a European minimum standard of fair and equal access to education for all

We favour enhanced networks at EU level to share best practice in education, healthcare, disability services and social security

6. Delivering Labour’s Vision 19 of Equality and Fairness

Labour parties and the Labour movement across Europe have consistently fought for a Social Europe based on socialist democracy. We have fought for better conditions and pay for workers, women and local communities, a social floor of civil, economic and rights, and strong social protection for pensioners, people with disabilities and those seeking work. We have a clear vision of a fairer, better Europe, which we can achieve by working with our sister parties across Europe.

EU institutions should be as diverse as Europe’s diverse population. We believe we can only address European issues if all European voices play a role in decision making within our institutions and governing bodies. We believe that women, migrants, the LGBTQI community and people living with disability should be as well represented within the EU institutions as they are in modern European society.

Labour has a long and proud history of fighting for the equal rights of women, LGBTQI people and minorities, and the European Union has helped Irish people to secure their rights, notably equal pay for equal work and equal access to employment when Ireland first joined in 1973. Any form of discrimination is unacceptable and Labour will continue to seek equality for all.

HOW WE CAN DELIVER OUR VISION OF EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL:

We will continue to work towards delivering a Social Europe

The EU must strive to deliver a genuinely Social Europe, based on justice, equality and solidarity

Your rights must be put before those of corporations’ economic freedoms. It is vital that a Social Progress Protocol is inserted into EU treaties which put a fair and decent standard of living for all at the heart of European policy making

Labour MEPs will protect and promote digital rights for all. Access to the internet, personal privacy online, and protection from online bullying and harassment must all be guaranteed

We will demand that minimum standards of social protection are upheld for older people, for carers and for anyone unable to work for whatever reason

The EU needs to strengthen partnerships with developing countries, including supporting the creation of a comprehensive European Investment Plan for Africa

We firmly believe that overseas aid budgets should be increased to at least meet the agreed target of 0.7% of GNI

The Labour Party will promote a progressive form of globalisation, based on trade agreements that are binding in terms of social and environmental standards, human rights, consumer protection and workers’ rights

We will stand against private arbitration as part of trade agreements in favour of open, democratic control over trade disputes

The EU must stand strong against discrimination and promote equality at all levels

Labour representatives have been leading the charge in ending the Gender Pay

Gap in Ireland. Labour MEPs will continue this work at European level by proposing and supporting measures to close the gender pay gap and to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work, and equitable pensions, with specific measures to include a requirement for multi-national corporations to publish data on pay by gender and a directive to ensure people gain pension credits for time spent parenting

European laws must seek to make discrimination in the provision of goods and services illegal, based on the same grounds as in Ireland, including gender, age, disability, sexuality, ethnicity, religion and family/marital status

We will push for there to be better rules around making public and private sector boards and senior management more diverse and reflective of the European population, with provision for punitive damages

We will push for European political groupings to only receive public funds if they meet binding gender quota targets

Female MEPs should not be deterred from running for office because of poor maternity leave. We will push for a directive on maternity cover for all elected representatives

It is time for a significant EU Gender Equality Strategy, that looks to end pay and pension gaps, combat sexual harassment and gender-based violence, and ensure that everyone has access to their full sexual and reproductive rights

Working with our European sister parties, we will push for strong initiatives at EU level to help combat domestic violence and violence targeting intimate partners and/or children, to include peer review mechanisms, promotion of best practice and funding to be dedicated to provide the necessary services

The EU must recognise that period poverty is a very real issue for many women

A year on the from the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, we are now calling for EU rules to ensure minimum standards for maternity and termination services that are of high quality and that afford women choice

Labour MEPs will call for the full implementation at EU level of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and work with disability organisations to achieve this

We will promote and support measures to ensure that all persons with disabilities have access to inclusive education, with personalised supports, and an inclusive workplace in the open labour market with a fair wage, reasonable accommodation, and access to an effective social protection system

The EU must take a strong stance on ending the segregation of persons with disabilities in institutions, and support measures to assist people to transition from institutional to community-based living

We will advocate for new EU rules to remove legal and societal obstacles for LGBTQI people to live freely, equally and with respect

The Labour Party will continue to fight for a fair system of migration and refugee integration

We will fully support fair common EU asylum and migration policy that will ensure effective control of EU borders while fighting human trafficking and the criminal exploitation of people, and enhancing the protection of those in need of asylum

We will seek European rules that would ensure Ireland’s system of Direct Provision is replaced with a more humane reception and integration system

Migrant workers should not be exploited by unscrupulous employers. That’s why we will work for stronger workers’ rights that strengthen pay and conditions

Better funding of integration policies and greater supports are needed


7. Strengthening European 19 Democracy and Public Engagement

Labour parties across Europe continue to be at the forefront of fighting to strengthen democracy and individual rights.

Social Europe is under threat from right-wing economic policies that have eroded decent pay and conditions for workers by prioritising corporations over people. As economic inequality has grown, extreme nationalists and populists have played on public anger and stoked fears, but they offer no real solutions. Labour’s sister parties in the European Parliament have always been to the forefront in insisting on strong social and environmental protection in EU policy, and we have promoted many policies to strengthen workers’ rights and to raise wages. We also initiated sanctions against Hungary’s extreme nationalist government led by Fidesz, which has been indulged as a member of the European People’s Party (EPP) group, of which Fine Gael is a member. Labour’s Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group has always taken steps against any member parties that cross the line by doing deals with the far right.

Right-wing economic policies promote commercialised news media over public service journalism. The EU plays a vital role in shaping Ireland’s future, and it is essential that Irish people have the opportunity to follow EU political news. Labour wants to increase people’s awareness of European decisions, and make it clear that the European Union is an arena in which political battles play out on a daily basis.

The European elections will be a fight between those who believe in people’s democratic rights, workers’ rights and minority rights – and those who clearly do not. Labour is determined to ensure that we influence European decisions in a way that benefits the interests of working people.

STRENGTHENING EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY AND INCREASING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN PROJECT IS VITAL:

Now more than ever, we need strong action to promote and reinforce European democracy

The European Union needs better means to defend the rule of law and human rights in all member states

We will fight racism and xenophobic rhetoric in society as well as in politics, and oppose racist and xenophobic anti-migrant policies

Strong EU measures are required to counteract hatred, intolerance and discrimination against others

Fake news must be tackled. Labour will demand measures to counteract the manipulation of public debate

Labour has always fought to protect whistle-blowers. With our colleagues in the S&D group, we will build on the recently agreed Whistle-blowers Directive

We will advocate for Ireland’s tradition of military neutrality and safeguard our opt-outs from EU common defence policies

The European Union must support public service broadcasting and journalism.

We will promote public access to official documents, freedom of information laws and open access to research findings when the research was publicly funded

A better Europe is possible. We can demonstrate this to citizens across Europe

We will continue to work closely with the Party of European Socialists, and the Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament, to build public awareness of the real debates and divisions that exist on European policies

Labour MEPs will work to promote a progressive vision of the European Union, based on equality, freedom, human rights, protection for workers and high standards of environmental protection

Labour will help demonstrate to the public that many perceived barriers to State action in the economy are often not due to EU rules but are the policies of rightwing governments and their tendency to blame “Brussels” for their own unpopular decisions

We will always support democracy at all levels of government

Labour believes that that decisions should be made as close as possible to the people affected. We fully support the transfer of powers to local, regional and national government where appropriate

We will look for greater linkages and two-way exchanges between the European level of government and local government, including enhanced European networks for local representatives and local government management

Citizens should be able to participate in the decision-making processes of the EU.

We will back proposals to introduce forums for citizen participation with a status similar to the European Committee of the Regions

In order to have social policy that works for all of our citizens, it needs to be funded properly

Labour MEPs will support progressive plans to grow the EU’s core budget, as long as that money is for the purpose of a Social Europe that will improve living standards throughout Europe and reduce inequalities between people, regions and member countries

Strong measures must be put in place to prevent any misuse of EU funds

There are many benefits to the EU that are often left unknown because the language can be hard for many to understand. We promise to always be clear and open when discussing the European Union

Labour MEPs and representatives will use Plain English when talking about the European Union institutions and decision-making

EU rules around consumer protection are very important to Irish people. We will make sure that they are always maintained

Ireland has among the least public holidays in the European Union. We think it is time for another to celebrate European solidarity. We back calls for Europe Day on 9 May to become a public holiday in all member states, to celebrate peace and unity in Europe

LETTER FROM PARTY PRESIDENT

We in Sinn Féin are leaders. We stand up for what is right, we take risks for peace and we hold the powerful to account.

We keep our word and when we say we are going to do something, we do it.

Four strong Sinn Féin MEPs went to Europe to fight for Irish interests.

Our MEPs now need to continue that fight – for communities, for ordinary working people and families.

Sinn Féin MEPs stood up for the Good Friday Agreement and for Irish interests in the face of the Tory Brexit agenda. We were first to pursue the idea of Special Designated Status for the north of Ireland within Europe – a policy, which has now been widely accepted.

Team Sinn Féin stood up to the banks and confronted vulture funds, fought hard against water charges, the erosions of our neutrality and demanded investment in rural Ireland.

Sinn Féin wants to see a fair and prosperous Ireland.

Nobody who goes out to work every day, or is forced to stay at home through disability or because they are caring for others, should struggle to pay their bills or keep a roof over their head.

No older person should be faced with the indignity of lying on a hospital trolley when seriously ill.

Nobody should have to go to the courts to fight for their rights.

No one should live in fear in their home or community.

We will not stand for it.

We are fighting back.

We want radical reform in Europe with more power returned to member states.

We want Irish neutrality recognised and protected.

We want strong action on climate change but oppose carbon taxes.

We want support for rural Ireland with no community left behind.

We will stand up for Ireland’s interests in the Brexit negotiations and believe that now is the time for Irish Unity.

Sinn Féin will fight for you.

Sinn Féin will fight for your community. Sinn Féin will fight for Ireland.

Mary Lou McDonald TD UACHTARÁN SINN FÉIN

Executive Summary

The Sinn Féin team of MEPs are part of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group in the European Parliament. What unites this group of 52 MEPs is the vision of a socially equitable, sustainable and peaceful Europe based on international solidarity.

Sinn Féin MEPs work together in the Parliament fighting for workers rights, public services and a fair and democratic Europe.

In contrast, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael belong to the Right-wing EPP and ALDE groups which want to create a Superstate centralising power in Europe far away from ordinary people. These groups are also determined to create an EU army with more military spending rather than investing to tackle the cost of living and provide quality public services. They are advocates of austerity and beholden to corporate interests.

Sinn Féin reject increased militarisation and related spending and will fight for ordinary people.

It is only by voting for Sinn Féin that you will get credible and effective MEPs who will fight for ordinary Irish people’s interests in Europe, challenge vested interests and insiders and work for a radically and progressively reformed European Union.

BREXIT

There is no good to come from Brexit for Ireland.

In 2016 a majority of people in the North voted to Remain and for the whole of Ireland to stay in the EU together.

Brexit is unwanted and is being foisted upon our people, businesses and key sectors of the economy bringing great uncertainty and instability.

Recognising our special and unique circumstances, and the fact that we have a peace process which is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement for over twenty years, Sinn Féin adopted a policy calling for ‘Designated Special Status’ for the North.

We cannot withstand exclusion customs union or single market.

We cannot return to borders of the past.

One of the greatest symbols of our peace is the invisible border which has enhanced the social cohesion and economic integration of our island.

Sinn Féin support the Withdrawal Agreement - with the backstop - as the least worst Brexit option, which will protect jobs, trade and avoid a hardening of the border.

Working with Border Communities Against Brexit, with farmers and businesses, with human rights activists, women’s groups, youth and student organisations, Sinn Féin has helped influence the Brexit negotiations within the European Parliament and put Ireland’s interests and the Good Friday Agreement at the centre.

We have prioritised that the EU remains committed to continued cross-border funding.

IN THE COMING PERIOD:

We will seek to ensure that the north elects representatives who reflect the views of the majority of people who wish to remain within the EU;

We will seek to ensure that the pathway to Irish unity outlined in the Good Friday Agreement is mirrored by a pathway to rejoin the EU;

We will seek EU support for unity through an approach that prioritises cross-border rules, standards, rights, and social and economic integration.

Promoting Irish Unity

The Brexit crisis has created unprecedented political uncertainty across the entire island. Irish citizens in the north who voted to remain must not be dragged out of the EU against their wishes. The Good Friday Agreement sets out a pathway for Irish reunification through a unity referendum. In the wake of the Brexit vote, there is growing support for such a referendum.

Sinn Féin MEPs will continue to build support for a unity referendum and the convening of an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity.

It is essential that both governments plan for such a referendum, setting out the political, economic, social and cultural changes that will come about. We know that all-Ireland health and education systems will deliver better outcomes for patients and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the allIreland economy. We know that infrastructure planning on an all-island basis will allow for people and communities to reach their full potential by creating employment and economic opportunity.

We need to prepare for Irish unity. One of those with a major responsibility in this area, the Irish government, is reluctant to undertake its duty to help prepare our citizens, north and south, for the changes that will be needed. This must change. The Irish government needs to begin the process of preparing for Irish reunification. It needs to take the lead in bringing all sections of society, north and south together to plan for an orderly constitutional transfer. The people of this island need to be part of the debate about their future.

Sinn Féin is committed to building a prosperous and inclusive society based on justice, fairness and equality.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT TO:

Build political support in Europe and in Ireland to bring about Irish reunification;

Ensure that the EU makes a financial contribution to support a reunified Ireland;

Build support in Europe for the development of a White Paper and an all-Ireland Forum on Irish unity.

Reforming the European Union

Sinn Féin is working to build a fairer and more democratic EU. A European Union that works for the people of Europe, not for the EU insiders, middle-men and corporate interests. Greater transparency must be introduced, the militarisation agenda halted, social protections legally bolstered and powers returned to member states.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

The introduction of a mandatory Transparency Register to clean up corporate lobbying;

An end to secret voting in the Council which allows governments to hide positions from the public;

A reduction of unnecessary bureaucracy to simplify application processes for community and voluntary sector, farmers and business;

Enhanced national sovereignty;

A Social Progress Protocol to the EU Treaty.

Building a Social Europe

Sinn Féin is committed to public services. The EU Fiscal Compact is an economic straitjacket that prevents member states from boosting public spending even when this is badly needed. It does this by imposing one-size-fits-all rules on debt and deficits that are just not suitable. These rules severely limit our ability to invest our own money on critical things like health, housing and childcare.

Likewise, EU rules on competition and State Aid can prohibit interventions aimed at protecting jobs in sectors facing particular challenges, protecting core services like post offices or making cheaper options available to the public in areas like insurance. Sinn Féin MEPs will reject the move to enshrine the Fiscal Compact Intergovernmental Treaty into permanent EU law. Together with our allies in the European Parliament we will pursue the goal of re-nationalising macroeconomic policy and fiscal powers.

EU banking policy, which is driven by unelected officials, favours banks and corporate elites at the expense of ordinary people. The ECB’s quantitative easing programme is pumping billions into the banks to the benefit of corporations and major polluters. It should be replaced by the direct transfer of newly created money to governments so they can engage in green investment and by quantitative easing for the people ie payments to households. And the EU’s current proposal to deal with nonperforming loans aims to ‘deepen the market’ for such loans. In reality this proposal will give free reign to the Vulture Funds and amounts to a second bail-out for banks. The proposal should be withdrawn.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

An easing of State Aid rules for vulnerable sectors of the economy;

An end to the Eurozone straitjacket;

Reform of the ECB and monetary policy that works for the people;

Greater regulation of banks and vulture funds.

Militarisation, Neutrality

With the full support of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and their partners in Europe the EU is increasingly becoming a military union. The launch of the EU’s military co-operation programme PESCO and the creation of funds for the arms industry will further jeopardise Irish neutrality, our respected international reputation for UN peacekeeping and divert vital public money away from EU funds such as CAP and cohesion which are being cut. Sinn Féin is opposed to PESCO and to Irish money being used to fund companies who are exporting arms and fuelling conflicts around the world.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

A specific protocol attached to the EU treaties on Irish neutrality similar to that secured by Denmark;

No EU money to the arms industry;

An Irish withdrawal from the EU’s permanent military structured cooperation (PESCO);

A ban on the export of EU manufactured arms to countries in conflict;

EU recognition and respect for neutral member states defence policy;

No Irish money to be used for military projects in other member states.

Tax justice and tax sovereignty

The Lux Leaks, Panama Papers, Paradise Papers and other leaks have revealed the massive extent of corporate tax dodging, corruption and money laundering by the world’s richest individuals and corporations. Experts estimate that governments are losing US$500 billion every single year as a result of tax avoidance by multinational corporations.

While we insist on each member state’s right to determine its own tax system, Sinn Féin recognises the need for EU and international agreements to end tax avoidance by the wealthiest corporations in the world. Sinn Féin advocates for a public country-by-country reporting by the largest multinationals of their turnover, profits and tax paid. We also demand the Irish government end its expensive and wasteful appeal against the Commission in the Apple case. The €14 billion deposited by Apple in an escrow account could be used to invest in vital things like housing, health and childcare.

SINN FÉIN WILL FIGHT FOR:

The Irish government to defend our veto on taxation matters in the Council;

Any fundamental changes in global taxation to take place at the international level;

The Irish government to end its position of blocking public country-by-country reporting for the largest multinational corporations in the Council;

The Irish government to fully implement the agreed EU-wide initiatives to increase transparency and tackle tax avoidance such as the Directives on Administrative Cooperation (information-sharing) and the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives;

An end to the Irish government’s expensive, wasteful and futile appeal against the Commission’s state aid on the sweetheart tax deals granted by Revenue to Apple;

The swift and full implementation of all aspects of the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, delayed by the Irish government, including for full registers of beneficial owners of companies to be publicly available.

Championing workers’ rights - better jobs and better pay

The same parties and institutions who imposed destructive austerity policies now preside over a one-sided and unfair recovery. Unemployment has dropped but insecure employment with low wages has risen. EU law currently prioritises corporate interests and the single market over the rights of ordinary people. Sinn Féin believe the EU could and should play a greater role in protecting workers’ and trade union rights. We will campaign for a binding ‘Social Progress Protocol’ to the EU Treaty to guarantee that pay and employment conditions cannot be undermined by rulings of the ECJ.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

Full employment based on high quality and stable jobs;

A living wage and against bogus sub-contracting;

An end to zero-hours contracts, precarious work and privatisation;

Positive incentives and other measures to enable people to overcome barriers to employment;

Ending gender discrimination and the gender pay gap, with effective enforcement mechanisms;

Mandatory trade union recognition and greater protection for workers through collective bargaining and defending the right to strike;

Workers’ access to well-funded and effective life-long learning and re-training, including through targeted Social Clauses in procurement contracts and explicit targets in EU funding programmes;

A reversal of the race-to-the-bottom with equal rights and protections for all workers.

Climate Change, Environment, Sustainability

Climate change is a crisis of under-regulated capitalism – a system that has allowed big polluters to turn a profit without taking into account the consequences on our planet. The EU’s market solutions approach has failed. The Irish government’s suggestion that householders be punished for their failures with increased carbon taxes will likewise fail because affordable energy and transport alternatives do not exist for ordinary people. We need to fully enforce binding targets on the biggest polluters, significantly increase public investment in the roll-out of affordable alternatives for householders and commuters and ensure a full decarbonisation of our economies before 2050.

SINN FÉIN WILL FIGHT FOR:

No carbon tax hikes;

Establishment of a robust strategy for decarbonising the economy before 2050 through investment in alternatives;

Divestment from fossil fuels in all member states, similar to the Irish Fossil Fuel Divestment Act;

An EU wide ban on hydraulic fracturing (fracking), as well as the import of fracked gas;

Full transposition of the Habitat’s Directive and meeting all biodiversity targets;

Full implementation of the Single Use Plastics Directive.

Trade Agreements

The Lisbon Treaty bestowed dangerous new negotiating powers on the Commission which it has used to pursue a ‘New Generation’ of trade agreements that further threaten public services, environmental protection and our own right to regulate. These new agreements encourage a race to the bottom and open up markets in which only the super multinationals will thrive. Sinn Féin oppose the Multilateral Investment Court which the Commission, with the support of Fine Gael, is seeking to create. This court gives companies the right to sue a democratically elected government for policy changes that affect their profits.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT AGAINST:

Trading away of our democracy and rights through these agreements;

The establishment of the Multilateral Investment Court.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

Fairer trade deals which respect member state sovereignty;

The protection of public services and our environment from bad trade deals.

Rural Development

Sinn Féin has been fighting for Ireland’s rural interests in Europe. We have been lobbying for protected quality schemes for Irish products and the provision of free WiFi access in public spaces through the WiFi 4 EU scheme. We greatly value the LEADER Programme’s investment contribution to often neglected rural areas and believe the programme should be put back in the hands of local people via community-led local development companies. We call for a State Aid exemption for rural areas in light of Brexit and urge the reduction of bureaucracy so that a greater portion of EU funding for things like broadband actually reaches the intended beneficiaries instead of being pocketed by middle-men.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT:

For the LEADER Programme to be put back in the hands of local people and for continued access to Leader funds for the North post-Brexit;

For a State Aid exemption for rural and peripheral areas on the basis of Brexit;

For EU money for broadband services to cease becoming entangled in EU bureaucracy and ending up in the pockets of consultancies and foreign capital investment firms;

Against the commercialisation of our rural areas through EU level Schemes such as that which has seen the plantation of large swaths of rural land with invasive forest species, with little or no return or consultation of rural communities;

For both rural-proofing and island proofing of legislation;

For an Islands Intergroup to be set up in the European Parliament, to be the first dedicated forum through which to discuss the needs of island territories.

Agriculture, CAP

Farm incomes are deeply unequal and for many small farmers are unsustainably low. The re-design of the Common Agricultural Policy post-2020 provides an opportunity to correct current imbalances and protect the family farm model. Sinn Féin opposes any cuts to pillar I or pillar II of the CAP. We advocate an upper payment limit of €60,000 to improve the spread of financial support. We also propose ending the unjust system of historical entitlement.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

Continued access to CAP funding for farmers in the North post-Brexit;

An upper payment limit of €60,000 to improve the spreading of financial support, and a redistributive payment to ensure farmers get extra support on the first 15 hectares declared;

A move to harmonise per hectare payments by 2023;

A proportionate system of penalties that takes into the consideration the economic situation of the farmer;

A ban on unfair trading practices such as below cost selling;

An increase to the minimum national spend on young farmers and a scheme to assist young farmers to purchase land;

Simplified ECO schemes in pillar I and pillar II that remunerate farmers fairly;

A Common Agricultural Policy that allows farmers to be the custodians of the environment, based on smaller scale farming that encourages ecological development;

The environmental schemes within CAP to properly incentivise conservation, environmental protection and biodiversity.

Fisheries, the Marine, Coastal Communities, Islands

Local fisheries are suffering while profit-driven super-trawlers controlled by multi-nationals devastate our environment, fish stocks and coastal communities. The term Common Fisheries Policy has become a byword for bankruptcy and bureaucracy. The CFP needs to be reformed to sustain our oceans, to sustain our fishermen, local economies and coastal communities.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

Radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy;

Increased infrastructure to support Irish coastal communities and our islands;

Transferring more decision-making back to Ireland;

Protection against super-trawlers;

Expanding EU funding to help Irish fishing communities and to protect the environment;

An equal and mutually beneficial fishing deal for Ireland following Brexit.

Equality for all Regions

There has been little or no sign of recovery in several regions on the island of Ireland. The West and Border Regions in particular have been starved by both governments of the funding they badly need. Sinn Féin MEPs oppose the Commission’s proposal to invest in militarisation by plundering Regional Development Funding. We also campaigned and secured commitments to maintain Interreg and Peace IV funding to the north and border areas post-Brexit.

SINN FEIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

EU transport funding for the Western Rail Corridor, and the Western Arc stretching from Derry to Cork;

Protection of EU funding streams to the north, border and rural regions post-Brexit;

The Irish government to draw down funding for the areas that need it most and oppose regressive changes to European Funding streams;

Cross-border infrastructure projects to link regions of Ireland and prevent further development overly-centralised on Dublin.

Protecting Public Services

Tax avoidance by major multi-nationals and the militarisation agenda favoured by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and their respective groups in the European Parliament diminish the money available for investment in vital public services.

Successive European Commission proposals have driven an agenda of privatisation to the detriment of public services. Public Private Partnerships are a big part of this agenda. The Irish public recently witnessed in our school buildings the chaotic consequences of this financially wasteful approach and Sinn Féin will continue to resist this agenda.

In its latest power grabbing effort, the Commission is proposing to give itself an advance veto on the attempts national legislators might want to make to improve the accessibility, quality and affordability of services. Under the ‘new notification procedure’ proposed to enforce the Services Directive the Commission would have to be given three months’ notice of draft proposals that place requirements on service providers. The unelected and secretive Commission would have the power to decide a proposal is not permissible. We would be prohibited from introducing it and would have to bring an appeal to the ECJ before we could act. This is bad for services and bad for democracy.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT:

For the right of local councils, the Dáil and the Assembly to legislate around the provision of services in the interests of the public and the environment. We will demand this proposal for a new services ‘notification’ procedure is withdrawn;

To oppose the Commission’s drive towards the privatisation of public services such as transport. We will resist the expansion of public-private partnerships, which amount to creeping privatisation of public services, whenever it is proposed as a pseudo-solution to the EU’s economic problems.

Water

The Irish people demonstrated in their hundreds of thousands that clean tap water is a fundamental right to be provided by the state - not a commodity to be sold and purchased.

The EU agenda of charges and privatisation must be put to an end once and for all. The Sinn Féin team of MEPs has been working hard to ensure subsidiarity on water management and to consolidate Ireland’s derogation on domestic water charges. Next year the Water Framework Directive will be recast – it is vital the Sinn Féin MEPs are re-elected to ensure this derogation from domestic water charges is copper fastened.

The European Commission is taking enforcement proceedings against the Irish government for its failure to invest in waste water treatment. If penalties and fines are to be avoided adequate investment is needed.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT TO:

Ensure the EU fully implement the demands of the European Citizen’s Initiative Right2Water and put an end to the privatisation agenda, particularly in relation to water management;

Copper fasten the derogation to domestic water charges in Art 9.4 in the Water Framework Directive, ensuring that the Irish state can make its own decision on the matter;

Ensure high quality drinking water for all by investing in water treatment infrastructure;

Introduce greater transparency so that we do not have a repeat of Commissioner Vella’s political interference in how Ireland decides to manage its water.

Promoting Human Rights and Equality

Sinn Féin use the platform of the European Parliament to highlight human rights abuses across the world and to promote a rights-based society. We believe the EU could do a lot more to promote equality and human rights and enshrine them in EU law, particularly by incorporating social rights into its legislation.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

Ireland to fully comply with all human rights obligations under the ECHR and European Social Charter;

EU support for an Acht Gaeilge in the North of Ireland;

EU support for the adoption of an All-Ireland Charter of Rights to harmonise guarantees, as provided for under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement;

Social rights to be included within relevant European legislation, such as the right to housing, the right to energy and the right to water;

All legislation to be gender-proofed and disability-proofed so that women and people with disabilities are not negatively affected by any legislation;

LGBT+ appropriate medical care and recognition of unions and families across the EU.

Promoting the Irish language and minority languages in the EU

There are 55 million speakers of regional, minority or lesser used language in Europe, many of whom face discrimination.

Sinn Féin fought hard for the recognition of Irish as an official language of the EU. We will campaign for speaking rights in Irish to be rolled out at Committee level, as it is in the plenary.

We also advocate that a European Language Ombudsman be established.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT FOR:

Speaking rights in Irish to be rolled out at a committee level in the Parliament, just as it is in the plenary;

A European Language Ombudsman to act as a watchdog for states who engage in discrimination against a person’s language rights and advise on how to mitigate instances of language discrimination in the EU.

International solidarity

Sinn Féin has always been a party of international solidarity. We know from Ireland’s own struggle, the value and strength this solidarity can bring. In the European Parliament, Sinn Féin has helped give a voice to oppressed people struggling for peace, democracy and self-determination in Europe and around the world – including Palestine and Catalonia.

Sinn Féin supports arms embargos against human rights violators, such as Saudi Arabia, which the EU chooses to ignore. We will oppose efforts by the EU to create a foreign policy approach that undermines national sovereignty, international law and the Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The Irish government should assert our own independent foreign policy on behalf of the Irish people.

SINN FÉIN MEPS WILL FIGHT TO:

"Local 2019: Fianna Fail","Foreword
In order for communities across Ireland to achieve their full potential, they need local representatives who want to make a difference. Our party councillors have always been focused on getting things done, working towards a positive vision for their home area rather than just being involved in protest politics.

This kind of commitment is needed now more than ever because having strong and vocal local councillors does matter. Active and effective councillors can improve access to local services and improve standards of living. They help families secure a home, work on the local development plan, ensure roads are invested in and set commercial rates. Their decisions play a significant part in sustaining local economic success. The calibre of people we elect locally shapes our communities and ultimately our country. That’s why we need more diversity and women elected to our councils to ensure they reflect the communities they are put in place to represent and can change them for the better.

Local government has gone through a lot of changes over the past few decades. It is, however, still the first port of call for the majority of the public when they need advice about their own area on a range of public services. Positive change starts from the grassroots up and local elections are the critical test in supporting the type of pragmatic politics that prioritises solutions over just giving out about problems.

This manifesto gives an oversight of that change and what our party believes should be prioritised over the next five years at local authority level such as supporting home ownership and tackling climate change. Our team of candidates are drawn from a tradition of public service and are deeply committed to the prosperity of their communities. They live and work in their areas and are deeply rooted in local community and voluntary groups and sports clubs. That is the kind of grassroots leadership that every community needs to thrive and prosper.

Please support your local Fianna Fáil team on May 24th.

Supporting Social Homes & Affordable Home Ownership

Building Social & Affordable Homes

MAIN PROPOSALS

We will:
• Double House building to 40,000 units per annum
• Increase Local Authority resources to build 50,000 social homes by 2024
• Cut red tape on Local Authorities to build more homes
• Undertake a “Housing first” approach to tackle homelessness

• Help first time buyers by reforming the tax and planning system for REITs (Cuckoo Funds)
• Launch a new Tenant Purchase scheme
• Build a new deal for Tenants and Landlords
• Strengthen the right to live in rural Ireland
• Create a new specialised Planning Court to accelerate decisions
• Enable downsizing by choice

DOUBLE HOUSE BUILDING TO 40,000 UNITS PER ANNUM

Just over 18,000 homes were built in 2018. Re-Building Ireland’s targets fall far short of what is needed to grapple with the housing crisis. With the population rising by 60,000 per annum and household sizes falling, we need to double the amount of homes we build to meet demand and achieve genuinely affordable prices.

Half of these 40,000 homes per annum will be social and affordable units. We will ensure local authorities’ plans reflect new, ambitious aims for home building across the country.

INCREASE LOCAL AUTHORITY RESOURCES & DISCRETION TO MEET 200,000 NEW HOMES TARGET INCLUDING 50,000 NEW SOCIAL HOUSING UNITS BY 2024

There is currently sufficient local authority owned land zoned for over 38,000 units. Capital funding has already been tripled under Fianna Fáil pressure since 2016 but much more needs to be done.

We will set up a €100m rolling fund for Local Authorities to procure additional land in cities to ensure there is an adequate supply of appropriate land for future development. This will be co-ordinated with the Land Development Agency.

According to DPER the estimated unit all-in costs (i.e. including land costs and excluding abnormal) range from €175,000 to €195,000 for a 2 bed and €190,000 to €210,000 for a 3 bed. To meet these new targets, we will increase capital expenditure on housing to €2bn per annum, a €665m increase on 2019 spending. Based on figures from the Government Economic & Evaluation Service a €1m increase in construction investment creates 12 jobs in a single year. This €665m increase will create an additional 8,000 jobs.

CUT RED TAPE ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO BUILD MORE HOMES

Excessive red tape is frustrating local authorities who want to build more direct homes. Issues like Departmental procedures are constraining the ability of councils to put bricks and mortar in the ground. We will double the discretion spending thresholds to €12m for local authorities. This will reduce red tape and free up councils to get building. We will also utilise the Land Development Agency (LDA) to help unlock appropriate Local Authority sites for development.

UNDERTAKE A “HOUSING FIRST” APPROACH TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS

Homelessness is a national scandal that is a scar on our country’s streets. We cannot allow a desensitised complacency to seep into our view of the plight of homeless families. Instead, we need to be much more ambitious in getting to grips with the crisis. Fine Gael have become so defensive about their housing plan and they keep saying ‘the plan is working ‘. It clearly isn’t. We will prioritise a Housing First approach drawing on the successful model in Finland and utilising our ramped up social housing targets to address this crisis.

BUILD 50,000 NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES BY 2024

Fianna Fáil believes that home ownership is good for families and good for communities. Our policy will be focused on increasing supply with 200,000 new homes including 40,000 more affordable homes for average income workers. We will ensure the rapid implementation and expansion of the Affordable Home scheme up to 2024. This will be significantly increased with a €2bn fund, some €1.7bn above current commitments over five years and will operate in conjunction with the new Land Development Agency and expanded Part V.

HELP FIRST TIME BUYERS BY REFORMING THE TAX AND PLANNING SYSTEM FOR REITS (CUCKOO FUNDS)

The proliferation of REITs snapping up whole estates and apartment blocks is creating an unprecedented level of competition for first time buyers. Some 3,000 homes were purchased by REIT, a total investment of €1.1bn. REIT enjoys preferential tax treatment since 2013. These large-scale purchases predominatingly concentrated in Dublin are effectively pushing first time buyers out of contention for new properties.

The tax framework facilitating this growing trend needs to be fundamentally changed and overhauled with a view to protecting first time buyers and balanced communities. In addition, the planning system should be empowered to ensure that no single buyer can bulk purchase entire developments. A large amount of each development should be zoned for individual purchases. We will:
• Initiate a comprehensive review of REIT’s tax arrangements and implement its recommendations.
• Amend the Planning & Development Act to earmark zoned lands and planning permissions for single unit purchasers.

RESTORE PART V IN FULL

Fianna Fáil supports the principle of fully retaining Part V as a major source of future housing supply and plays an important role in building sustainable communities. Local Authorities should have the power to decide the appropriate nature of the mix based on local considerations, but it should be kept to a minimum of 20%. We will:
• Restore Part V to 20%.
• Create Part V teams in each local authority drawing from the housing and planning sections to ensure a coherent approach. The teams will bring together developers and housing associations to ensure safe design, location, timelines and transfer issues are acceptable.
• Part V can yield up to 12,000 new units over 5 years if the target of 100,000 new private units, of which 60,000 will qualify under Part V criteria, is accomplished. The €10bn social housing programme will be used to purchase these units at cost price.

LAUNCH A NEW TENANT PURCHASE SCHEME

Local Authority Tenants should have a clear path to own their own home. Over decades this has transferred wealth to low income families and allowed them greater financial security. Fine Gael’s retreat from this policy risks alienating hard working families and increasing social divides in communities across the country.

A new ambitious tenant purchase scheme with the dividends earmarked for further investment in the social housing stock will help to diversify tenure mix in local authority estates and provides funds for investment in existing and expanding stock. Data from the NESC shows that previous Right to Buy schemes such as over the 2001-2003 period had, per annum, an average of 3,785 homes purchased or 4.3% of the stock per annum as drawn from the 2002 census data.

Extrapolating such a rate to the current 130,000 local authority units some 5,590 units would be sold per annum. Clawback mechanisms will be maintained to ensure properties are not subsequently sold off at a loss to the local authority.
• We will establish a new Local Authority Tenant Purchase scheme with discounts of up to 60%. The income threshold will be reduced to €10,000 per annum with individuals with savings or family support eligible to apply.

BUILD A NEW DEAL FOR TENANTS AND LANDLORDS

A healthy rental market needs affordable prices for renters and a fair return for landlords. The balance between tenants’ rights and responsibilities must be clear and stable to allow for certainty in investment. The state should roll out a national investment programme for affordable rent scheme with local authorities and AHBs. Greater steps are needed to protect neighbourhoods from rogue tenants who engage in anti-social behaviour. We will
• Retain and strengthen Rent Pressure Zones.
• Allow the Local Property Tax as a deductible expense.
• Create a National Rent Deposit Scheme.
• Roll out a national Affordable Rent Scheme.
• Strengthen the complaints system and penalties for rogue tenants including eviction in extreme cases.
• Create a rogue tenant’s database.

ALLOW OWNER MANAGEMENT COMPANY MEMBERS TO REDUCE THEIR LOCAL PROPERTY TAX BILL

The local property tax was established to fund services such as maintaining public lighting, roads and paths, grounds keeping and managing public parking. However, management fees in Owner Management Companies are now going towards many of these services, which mean that some homeowners are paying on the double.

We will introduce a partial reduction in the local property tax equal to one-third of the management fee, one-third of the local property tax, or €300, whichever is the lower amount. Under the proposed legislation, nobody would ever gain more than €300. There are over 75,000 apartments in Dublin city and over 200,000 across the country which will benefit from this measure.

ESTABLISH AN OMBUDSMAN FOR OWNER MANAGEMENT COMPANIES

Owner Management Companies are operated by volunteer directors who freely give their time to help their developments become a welcome place to live. However, they are governed by a dense web of law and require additional government assistance to ensure they are run properly and reach their full potential. We will appoint an Ombudsman for such companies who will be based within the Property Services Regulatory Authority. We estimate a running cost of €500,000 per annum.

ENABLE DOWNSIZING BY CHOICE

There is an acute shortage of family homes, particularly in the Dublin area. Many older couples whose families have grown up and moved out would consider selling three or four bed family homes which are possibly too big for their current needs and trading down to a smaller house or apartment. The key issue is to give older people a viable choice. We will:
• Introduce Incentives to persons who wish to trade down in such circumstances namely:
• Exempt the seller from stamp duty on the purchase of a new home subject to set maximums in terms of size and value.
• Exempt the seller from Local Property Tax on their new home for a period of five years.

STRENGTHEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN RURAL IRELAND

Rural Ireland cannot be left behind in the future of home building. Local people have the right to own a home in their community and raise their family there. Fianna Fáil is committed to defending local people’s right to build and own their own home in their own community on a sustainable basis.

We will strengthen the Planning and Development Act to protect this core right and place an onus on local authorities to provide a clear, transparent route for local people from a community to build and own there.

A new shared sites initiative will provide land in each local area for people who contribute to the local area to build their own homes. In addition, where social housing or affordable housing list recipients can also access appropriate rural sites owned by the local authority for minimal cost if they can prove they can afford to build on the site.

CREATE A NEW SPECIALISED PLANNING COURT TO ACCELERATE BUILDING DECISIONS

Long drawn out planning process and judicial reviews are delaying decision making on new buildings. We can tackle that bottleneck by creating a new specialised planning court that focuses on land and environmental issues. Drawing from the example of the Land and Environmental Court in New South Wales, Australia, it will cut down waiting times in critical legal and planning decisions. 

Safe Communities

Tackling Crime
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Increase Garda numbers to 16,000
• Set up community policing teams in each area linked to local authorities
• Fund a “Brighter Streets” campaign to improve public lighting in each local authority
• Empower Gardaí to seize and destroy scrambler & quad bikes on suspicion of anti-social behaviour
• Set out new Garda powers and Resident Support Workers to tackle anti-social behaviour
• Establish a dedicated public transport police
• Strengthen powers to evict tenants for extreme anti-social behaviour
• Impose mandatory sentences for knife crime & assaults on older people
• Expand Local Drug Taskforces
• Roll out a €10m community fund to tackle gang violence
• Establish Community Safety Fora in every part of the country

INCREASE GARDA NUMBERS TO 16,000

Boosting Garda numbers is vital to ensuring families are safe in their homes and communities. Additional Gardaí will allow extra resources to be directed towards critical areas such as Community Gardaí and the Traffic corp. This will include a dedicated public transport policing section. In tandem with fundamental internal reform of the Gardaí in light of the series of demoralising scandals fresh numbers will play an important part in renewing the force at a critical time.
• We will increase Garda numbers from current levels of 14,160 to 16,000. In addition, the Garda Training funding will be increased to €20m.

EMPOWER GARDAÍ TO SEIZE AND DESTROY SCRAMBLER & QUAD BIKES

The scourge of loud, intimidating scramblers and quad bikes on public roads and parks are destroying the quality of life in many estates throughout the country. Gardaí require additional targeted powers to get to grips with the spread of this deeply frustrating activity.
• We will implement recently published legislation to allow Gardaí to compulsorily seize and ultimately destroy scrambler bikes and quads on suspicion of anti-social behaviour.

SET UP COMMUNITY POLICING TEAMS ACROSS IRELAND

On the ground policing is the most effective way of preventing crime. Building strong, enduring connections with local areas is an integral part of the strength of An Garda Siochána. A new community policing team structure is a positive step in that direction.
• We will set up teams that will lead the way in ensuring community policing lies at the heart of An Garda Siochána’s strategy to protect the public.

ESTABLISH COMMUNITY SAFETY FORA IN EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY

Building strong links between An Garda Siochána and the community in every part of the country is vital to building a safe society. Active links and communication will help to target Garda resources more effectively and fully respond to the individual needs of each community.
• We will establish a community safety forum in every District comprising local Gardaí, local communities and other relevant stakeholders including the new Town Teams and restored Town Councils.

ESTABLISH A NEW €10M COMMUNITY FUND TO TACKLE GANG VIOLENCE

Equipping community groups to tackle the underlying factors driving on gang violence is a proven effective method to reduce crime rates. In disadvantaged areas local groups with an on the ground knowledge committed to improving their home area is key in addressing deep rooted causes of violence.
• We will establish a €10m fund to ensure community groups are given sufficient resources to work in affected communities.

IMPOSE MANDATORY SENTENCES FOR KNIFE CRIME AND ASSAULTS ON OLDER PEOPLE

Certain crimes are particularly dangerous to the community and need to be stamped out. Fianna Fáil will take a strong approach to tackling the scourge of knife crime and attacks on older people by imposing mandatory sentences. This will send a clear message that these crimes will not be tolerated.

EXPAND RESOURCES TO LOCAL DRUG TASKFORCES

The scourge of drug abuse is a problem throughout the country. Local and Regional Drug Taskforces need to be adequately resourced in order to rise to the growing challenge. Fianna Fáil will ensure these bodies are equipped to address serious drug issues in their areas with an increased Garda role.

NEW GARDA POWERS AND “RESIDENT SUPPORT WORKERS” TO TACKLE ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR

Too many homes and communities live in the shadow of intimidation. Anti-social behaviour by a minority damages the whole community. We will give increased powers to An Garda Síochána to deal with antisocial behaviour including new “Public Space Protection Orders”, “Disperse Orders” and “Community Protection Orders”.
• We will also establish the role of “Resident Support Worker”: a person living in an area employed by the Local Authority with a number of powers to assist in the battle against antisocial behaviour.

STRENGTHEN POWERS TO EVICT TENANTS FOR EXTREME ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR

A tiny minority of tenants can inflict massive hardship and frustration for an entire community. Fianna Fáil has introduced legislation to allow anyone to make a complaint about anti-social behaviour by a tenant. We believe that tenants should be expected to maintain a basic upkeep of the exterior of the house to avoid it and the surrounding neighbourhood being ruined by unsightly rubbish. In extreme cases the Residential Tenancies Board will be empowered to terminate tenancies.

FUND A “BRIGHTER STREETS” CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE P UBLIC LIGHTING IN EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY

Many bus stops, train stations and streets have inadequate lighting that discourages people from using them at night. Local Authorities must take their responsibilities in this area seriously and ensure streets and key public transport points are properly illuminated. We will allocate funding to Local Authorities to correct known blackspots in their localities. 

Balanced Growth

Sustaining Irish Towns
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Deliver High Speed Universal fibre to the Home Broadband
• Launch a National Mobile Phone Blackspot project
• Establish Digital Development Offices in each Local Authority area
• Launch Local Digital Strategies in each Local Authority area
• Set regional targets for employment
• Set up Town Teams and revitalise town and village centres
• Reform and expand the Town and Village Renewal Scheme
• Introduce Commercial Rate relief for rural businesses
• Set up a new specialist IDA, Enterprise unit for rural towns
• Protect the Post Office Network
• Restore the 4th Western Brigade to ensure we have a nationally balanced defence service

DELIVER HIGH SPEED UNIVERSAL FIBRE TO THE HOME BROADBAND BROADBAND

The delays and controversies that have hit the National Broadband Plan cannot be allowed to fatally undermine its ultimate delivery. Bridging the digital divide is vital to ensuring all parts of the country benefit from economic growth.

Following the withdrawal of key bidders, the viability for the government approach should have been fundamentally re-assessed. Fianna Fáil will ensure the NDP is delivered and universal fibre optic to the home is rolled out. We will support the roll out of fibre optic broadband directly to all premises in the state through commercial operators and direct state intervention.

LAUNCH A NATIONAL MOBILE PHONE BLACKSPOT PROJECT

Endemic problems with mobile phone coverage have frustrated businesses and families have rural Ireland for years. The government has yet to fully implement the forty recommendations set out by the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to boost mobile phone coverage across the country. It is a vital missing piece in the social infrastructure of a modern community.
• We will roll out a national mobile phone blackspot project building on the pilot project currently in Donegal.

ESTABLISH DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OFFICES IN EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY AREA

Digital Development is essential to future economic growth. We will establish Digital Development Offices in every Local Authority and implement a Local Digital Growth strategy. The role of Broadband officer should be retained and expanded in each county with a new Digital Development office. This office will be tasked with ensuring adequate access to digital technology in the area and implementing Local Digital Growth strategies.

DEVELOP REGIONAL DIGITAL HUBS

The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) has been a success in terms of job creation and promotion of digital related learning and training opportunities. Since its establishment in 2003 it has provided flexible office space and business support services to growing technology companies in Dublin. We will:
• Build on the success of the DHDA by engaging with local authorities to ensure that rural Ireland also benefits from the development of the digital sector.
• Provide up to €1m of funding to each local authority. This will support entrepreneurship throughout the country and enable tomorrow’s entrepreneurs to grow businesses and jobs in their home county.

SET REGIONAL TARGETS FOR HIGH-VALUE AND SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT

Balanced regional employment is critical to ensuring all parts of the country share in the benefits of growth. We will:
• Set targets for sustainable employment growth and high-value jobs on a regional basis.

SET UP TOWN TEAMS AND REVITALISE TOWN AND VILLAGE CENTRES

Towns and villages are the focus of local life and need specific supports if they are going to meet their full potential. We will:
• Roll out a national Town Centre Health Check Programme & establish a national database of Town Centres.
• Establish Town teams to lead the way in revitalising towns across the country.

INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE TOWN & VILLAGE RENEWAL SCHEME

The Town and Village Renewal Scheme has been weakened by red tape and underspend. It needs to be overhauled and additional supports for investing in derelict properties put in place. We will:
• Increase the Town and Village Renewal scheme to €25m per annum and link it to the Town Teams initiative.
• Launch a new pilot renovation grant schemes for Towns and Villages should be rolled out to incentivise people to invest in their properties.

INTRODUCE COMMERCIAL RATE RELIEF FOR RURAL BUSINESSES

The Commercial Rates system is in dire need of reform. Too many businesses are sinking under the weight of a model that is stifling innovation and enterprise. We will:
• Establish a Rate Holiday for start-up and small rural businesses.
• Introduce an “Inability to pay” clause for struggling businesses.
• Limit increase in commercial rates revaluations and allow them to be spread over a number of years.
• Introduce long-term reform of Commercial Rates on a revenue neutral basis.
• Introduce rate reductions for child care centres.

SET UP A NEW SPECIALIST IDA, ENTERPRISE UNIT FOR RURAL INVESTMENT

Far too many communities across Ireland are neglected by the IDA. Concentrating investment in a smaller and smaller part of the country will only to lead to grave regional imbalances and damage the economic and environmental sustainability of our country.
• We will set up specialist IDA/Enterprise Ireland unit focused on securing investment in rural areas.

PROTECT THE POST OFFICE NETWORK

Post Offices are an intrinsic part of a vibrant main street in every town and village. Fianna Fáil will maintain the current network, and then take meaningful action to ensure the long-term viability for An Post. This will include expanding the range of services that post offices can offer and providing a Public Service Obligation payment to post offices that comply with this including:
• State Services Hub
• Financial Services
• Multi-Use Community Centre

ENSURING LOCAL TAXES DELIVER LOCAL SERVICES

MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Ensure no overall Local Property Tax increases
• Expand Local Property Tax deferrals for elderly and low-income households
• Maintain local discretion over the LPT rate at 15%
• Introduce Property tax Relief for residents paying fees to Management Owner Companies
• Reinvest the Local Property Tax in the local area

ENSURE NO OVERALL LOCAL PROPERTY TAX INCREASES

Fine Gael has cynically played politics with this issue by continually delaying a decision on the future reform of the charge despite receiving legal warnings from their own Attorney General. This just prolongs uncertainty, runs the risk of legal challenges and the possibility of massive hikes in the tax next year.

Instead we believe that localised rates, broken down to the smallest level using CSO statistics, should be introduced to replace the 0.18% current tax rate to reflect the increase in property values since 2013. The national overall revenue from the Local Property Tax will remain at approximately €500m.

EXPAND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX DEFERRALS FOR ELDERLY AND LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

There are four separate categories of deferral of LPT, Income Threshold, and Personal Representative of a Deceased Person, Personal Insolvency and Hardship Grounds. In 2018 there were 58,000 claims for deferral made, nearly 56,300 of which were claims made on grounds of the income threshold. Currently there are many pensioners who have received increases in their pension payments and who could now exceed the income thresholds and will be unable to defer their LPT payments.

Deferrals can be 100 per cent or 50 per cent and they are payable later. Outstanding LPT remains a charge on the property until it is paid. Deferred LPT must be paid in full if the property is sold or transferred to another person. The interest charged on the deferred amount is currently set at 4 per cent per annum. Fianna Fáil believes this is an excessive interest charge considering the financial hardship that many people who qualify for the deferral are experiencing.

We will reduce the LPT interest rate to 2 per cent and introduce a 20% increase in the income thresholds for full and partial deferral of LPT liability.

MAINTAIN LOCAL DISCRETION OVER THE LPT RATE AT 15%

Local Authorities are struggling to make ends meet since Fine Gael slashed the local government grant. Not every authority can afford to reduce the LPT rate by 15% as a result and a number have increased it to fund projects. We believe that local representatives are best placed to know what their local communities need.

INTRODUCE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX RELIEF FOR RESIDENTS PAYING MANAGEMENT FEES

Management fees pay for some of the services that the Local Authority would otherwise provide, including keeping the grounds, maintaining the roads and paths, maintaining public lighting and managing public parking. The Local Property Tax was established to fund those services. This means some home owners are paying for the same thing on the double. Drawing on CSO statistics the average reduction would be around €86 across over 200,000 units and would cost the state around €17.5m a year. This is about ensuring we have a fair property tax system where nobody pays on the double for the same services.

We believe there should be a recognition that people are paying on the double, and to that end we propose a partial reduction in the local property tax equal to one third of the management fee, one third of the local property tax, or €300, whichever is the lower amount.

REINVEST THE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX IN THE LOCAL AREA

Finance is the litmus test of a truly independent and strong local government system. The government introduced a local property tax claiming it was to fund local services. In reality it was siphoned off to fund the setup and running of the Irish Water and to cover over the drastic reductions in the local government grant. Flexibility and discretion is needed to ensure local people have a real say to make sure money raised locally is spent locally.

We will ensure that local authorities are empowered to consult local people on where a certain amount of local money is spent. This would mean that a new participatory budgeting mechanism would operate operating through community and Town councils. 

Clean, Green Communities

Addressing Climate Change at a local level
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Create a competitive Local Environmental Innovation Fund to finance community groups and businesses with a green focus
• Empower Local Authorities to reduce commercial rates on businesses that meet low carbon targets
• Focus on delivering the 119 targeted actions in the National Biodiversity Plan
• Initiate a Bio-Diversity fund to protect our natural heritage
• Roll out local public climate awareness programmes
• Implement the Special Oireachtas Committee recommendations
• Fully administer Local Climate Change Action Plans
• Launch a Trees in Towns campaign to increase the number of trees in every town and village
• Establish a National Infrastructure Commission
• Region and Social proof our environmental policies
• Launch a national Housing retro fit programme
• Introduce a bottle deposit scheme and move towards banning non-recyclable single use plastics
• Set up an open anti-litter fund to tackle illegal dumping & street litter
• Increase fines for littering and expand the number of litter wardens
• Allow Local Authorities to implement Car Free zones
• Launch a new €55m National cycle ways strategy
• Earmark funding for cycle lane maintenance and clean up
• Allow Local Authorities to issue grant support and guidance on micro-energy generation
• Roll out the Green Dog Walking camping in each Local Authority
• Alter grid rules to allow homeowners, schools and businesses to sell renewable energy to the grid
• Ensure fair and transparent planning & community benefit over windfarm, solar and other renewable energy projects

Climate Change is the most pressing challenge facing the globe. The actions we take now to address this existential crisis will define our legacy to future generations. Fianna Fáil supports the implementation of the Special Oireachtas Committee recommendations in achieving a major shift in our climate change policy. We need to lead with decisive, committed and innovative policy shifts to reduce our carbon dependence and create a greener island.

Local Authorities through their climate action plans and in co-operation with the government have an important part to play in this process. A major retrofit programme for social housing should be led by Local Authorities.

A National Infrastructure Commission should be established to fully co-ordinate decarbonisation and assist Local Authorities in implementing their own individual plans.

Local Authorities should be given more flexibility to incentive local efforts to decarbonise. A new competitive environmental innovation fund open to both Local Authorities and community groups will help to finance new ideas to tackle climate change.

Flexibility over commercial rates and county climate change action plans will allow each area space to innovate and promote climate friendly policies.

Ireland has a beautiful countryside that we have a duty to maintain and protect. Keeping clean streets and a pristine countryside is an important duty of Local Authorities. Ramped up fines, litter wardens and a new fund to support innovative ways to reduce littering will be crucial to ensuring we protect our country from being spoiled.

Funding for new anti-litter campaigns will be allocated to a competitive pot for any group or local authority to apply to. Fianna Fáil Councillors will focus resources on ensuring Green Dog walking campaign is rolled out in each local authority area.

Your local, national and EU Fianna Fail teams are committed to working together to implement these 20 pledges on climate change and much more. 

Vibrant & Inclusive Communities

Helping Local Sports Clubs and Community Groups
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Establish an annualised Local Authority Sports Capital Grant in each Local Authority with ring-fenced development levy and LPT revenue
• Establish a Community Asset Fund to own & run community assets
• Create a Community ability to reclaim unused state land
• Establish a state fund to provide insurance for community groups & festivals
• Launch a revamped development levy system where major construction projects should integrate a contribution to local sports clubs such a land or monetary contributions
• Expand the large-scale infrastructure fund with a €25m allocation per annum to build more swimming pools
• Allocate €50m per annum to a revamped national Greenways Initiative
• Create a €10m per annum Playground Building fund for Local Authorities

Sports clubs and community groups are the lifeblood of Irish life across the country. The spirit of volunteerism that inspires so many people to spend time as coaches, directors and a wide host of other roles is the glue that keeps our communities together. The government has a clear role to play in helping and assisting local authorities to assist those people to ensure clubs reach their full potential and positively impact as many people as possible.

Additional funding, with new laws would allow communities to get the first option of buying key local assets and recognition in the planning system will help to give local clubs a real boost. Fianna Fáil is committed to fully supporting these groups to allow them to flourish and continue to play a central role in Irish life into the future.

Increasing funding for sports capital grants to clubs and community groups will help to open up sports to more and more people.

In addition, large scale funding for sports halls and swimming pools will help to expand sports participation across the country.

Insurance is a growing issue for many community groups and local festivals. The government should step up with a state led insurance fund to ensure these vital strands in local life can flourish into the future.

CREATING A VIBRANT LOCAL ARTS & CULTURE SCENE
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Establish a Local Authority Art Studio spaces scheme utilising vacant units in towns and villages
• Expand the Public Piano Initiative too all major transport hubs
• Set up a nationwide summer Art Camp programme under the Arts Council and Local Authorities
• Ensure every child automatically gets a local Library card when they start school
• Create a new fund to support new services in local libraries such as 3D technology “Makers Spaces” and expanded opening hours
• Ensure that Local Authorities implement a local arts action plan which benefits local communities and local artists
• Remove the €2,555,000 cap on the Percent for Art scheme.
• Utilising Local Authorities to promote pop up Gaeltacht’s and promoting the national language in all their services
• Ensure each local authority has a full time Irish language officer and that new housing developments are given appropriate local Irish names

Ireland has a proud artistic and cultural heritage that we need to cherish and foster. Local Authorities have an important role to play in cultivating and supporting local artistic and cultural groups.

A clear local arts action plan, expanding art studio spaces, ensuring every child has access to a library, a new summer art camp scheme and fully embracing our national language are all key objectives for Fianna Fail.

In addition, we should increase the artistic aspect of our capital investment plan to promote commissioning new art works across the country. Our councillors will work to ensure that a vibrant arts and cultural scene is at the heart of every community across Ireland.

Our library network forms a vibrant base for learning and cultural enrichment across Ireland. We should draw on those strengths and ensure that libraries continue to play a central role in Irish life into the future with a few simple but effective measures. We will ensure every child gets a library card when they start school and expand library opening hours and facilities with new 3D printing technology that will encourage a new wave of library users.

Our national language is an invaluable cultural asset that must be actively cherished and promoted. Local Authorities have an important role to play in maintaining the integrity of place names, utilising Irish language officers and putting forward new ways to use and enjoy the language.

MAKING LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORK FOR YOU
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Establish Town Councils & a new voluntary community council model
• Protect and promote local journalism by reforming the license fee and funding bursaries
• Re-establish Údarás Na Gaeltachta elections
• Allow local people to re-invest the Local Property Tax
• Introduce Directly Elected Mayors
• Revamp the development levy system to assist local sports clubs
• Establish a Community Asset Fund to operate community assets
• Create a community ability to reclaim land

In recent years local democracy in Ireland has been systemically weakened by Fine Gael and our country now has one of the weakest systems of local government in Europe. The financial resources, powers and services of local authorities have been systematically whittled away.

This is critically undermining the first tier of democracy in the state and further distancing local people from local decision making. We believe that a series of actions are required to empower local people to be involved in community development. This is a core part of our plans to build vibrant, inclusive communities across the country.

A new local government structure with directly mayors, re-established town councils and a new community council system will be at the core of a local government system that delivers for communities. In addition, new powers over taxes and development will ensure it can play a positive role in communities.

Allowing communities to take over underused state lands and buy assets will give local people a greater say over local infrastructure. This power will help people to shape their home area as they see fit.

In addition, we will launch a series of investments in the local media sector to ensure citizens can continue to access quality local news and journalism that is vital to local democracy and communities.

PUTTING OLDER PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF COMMUNITIES
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Incentivise the creation of specialised accommodation for older people in town centres by amending Part V to encompass specialised older people accommodation
• Fully restore Housing Adaptation grants
• Tackle loneliness amongst older people
• Establish a local Social Enterprise fund for older people

Local Authorities must help to ensure that older members of the community can play a meaningful role in it. Age should not be a fundamental barrier to a thriving life.

From housing rights to financial assistance to targeted funds Local Authorities will be tasked with ensuring that older people can live safely at their heart of their communities in their homes for as long as possible.

A CONTRACT FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING FOR PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Publish an implementation plan for rights of persons with a disability
• Ensure that adequate provision for people with a disability is made in new social housing units
• Implement key recommendations from the “Accessibility of Public Transport for People with Disabilities” report
• Support the building of accessible infrastructure
• Ensure ETBs promote and encourage engagement with people with a disability
• Support local disability groups to participate in local decision-making processes
• Expand the Autism Friendly towns initiative nationwide

A key goal for Fianna Fail at local and national level is ensuring people with a disability are empowered to take their place at the heart of the community. From implementing a comprehensive change to physical infrastructure to political changes it is vital that independent living is placed at the heart of overall policy.

Building sufficient accessible housing should at central to housing construction. Creating an accessible infrastructure such as playgrounds and sports clubs etc. must also be a core component of future construction. People with a disability will also be equipped to play a greater role in local decision-making drawing on the implementation of the UN Convention on the rights of persons with a disability.

Fianna Fáil will work to ensure that people with a disability are fully empowered to live independently.

ENSURING EQUALITY FOR ALL FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL UP
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Increase funding for childcare infrastructure in the community
• Appoint an Electoral Commission to increase the number of female candidates in local elections with a view to introducing gender quotas and increasing candidate diversity
• Expand the cash incentives for parties to enable more women to become involved in local politics
• Require Local Authorities to set gender targets in board appointments
• Implement a National LGBTQI Sexual health strategy
• Support female participation in sports
• Introduce financial penalties for organisations funded by the taxpayer that fail to operate gender equality in terms of employment practices
• Establish a new agency for Traveller accommodation
• Initiate further steps to encourage immigrant participation in local democracy
• Ensure every school participates in the Local Youth Council/ Comhairle na nÓg Scheme

As a republican party, a commitment to fighting discrimination in all forms is a core value for Fianna Fáil. We want to create a republic which is founded on the equality and dignity of every citizen. Equality should start from the ground up with a systematic engagement in tackling gender imbalances and barriers to full participation in community for all groups.

Local Authorities can act as a building block in full participation in the political process as well as an important forum in key local decision making. Encouraging immigrants to play a greater part in their community is vital to integration which has to start at a local level.

While Travellers were rightly recognised as an indigenous ethnic group in March 2017, they still face many challenges accessing suitable sites, houses and other services across the country. The accommodation crisis affecting the Traveller community is dire. We need a new agency committed to tackling the crisis head on and ensuring money is actually spent on suitable accommodation sites. Inadequate childcare provision is a key impediment to women fully participating in the work place. We will increase funding for additional childcare places by ramping up investment in community childcare facilities. We will also commit to reducing commercial rates for child care centres as insurance costs are actually jeopardising some of the centres from operating. 

Keeping Communities Moving

Investing in good roads and effective public transport
MAIN PROPOSALS
We will:
• Increase Roads maintenance by €175m
• Establish a new National Infrastructure Commission
• Expanding the role of the C&AG on infrastructure spending oversight
• Make Public Transport more reliable, affordable and attractive
• Allow Local Authorities to implement Car Free Street days
• Commit to a new €55m National cycle ways strategy Across the country too many roads are in dreadful condition. The public transport system is creaking under the pressure of growing numbers and insufficient state support. We need to bring our road network up to standard after years of inadequate funding by the state. Public transport links must be strengthened through both long-term capital investment guided by a National Infrastructure Commission but also an appropriate Public Service Obligation (PSO) to ensure it can deliver the services commuters need.

Local Authorities must take the lead in creating a safe environment for cycling and walking to build up liveable streets for all the community. We will empower Local Authorities to introduce car free zone days where they deem it appropriate and additional recourse to invest in segregated, safe cycle lanes.

In addition, a number of simple measures to help address congestion can be quickly undertaken such as:
• Promote Off Peak Travel. Vehicles using an e-tag should be rewarded for undertaking their journeys at off-peak times rather than at peak times via an annual tax credit. Employers should be given a PRSI reduction for allowing workers to use flexitime in starting/ finishing work at off-peak travel times, if they so choose.
• Smarter Planning: Any construction/road works or resurfacing should have to take into account effects on traffic volumes etc. and as a rule should be done at off-peak times and summer periods.
• Information Systems: Traffic accidents are costly not only for the direct damage they cause but also for the congestion they produce. There is a need to enhance information signalling of accidents to motorists to prevent traffic escalation. We should introduce a national accident signalling system.
• Revise Ireland’s legislation to support carpooling: Irish legislation effectively prevents people from carpooling with colleagues. We will amend legislation to make it easier for colleagues to share lifts to work, reducing emissions and congestion.
• Promote mixed work place starting times
• Boost Funding to existing Public Transport Services
• Pilot Bus Lanes on Motorways: As has already been done in Northern Ireland and the UK, we will pilot using bus lanes on motorways in order to provide a more attractive journey and compete with vehicle users. We will provide Park and Ride facilities at key points on the outskirts of Dublin, so that commuters can complete their journey by bus.
• Making Use of Port Tunnel
• Roll out new Park and Ride facilities

"Local 2019: Fine Gael","Let’s Take Ireland Forward Together

Ireland has come a long way in a short time. Hope and ambition have returned. People have worked hard for this and do not want to see any progress squandered. There is now huge investment in public services and significant job creation, and communities are starting to see the benefit of this:
• 2.2m people in employment – unemployment rate at 5.4%, 3 out of 5 jobs created outside of Dublin since 2016. This is 94,500 jobs.
• Major roads projects - M11 Gorey to Enniscorthy, N25 New Ross Bypass; N4 CollooneyCastlebaldwin commencing.
• Improvements on 1,100 rural roads.
• 18,000 new homes built in 2018
• 128 Primary Care Centres
• Lowest ever pupil teacher ratio - 26:1
• 2,600 Gardai attested since we re-opened Templemore, now at almost 14,000.
• €162m in Sports Capital in 2018
• €1.152bn investment in Water Infrastructure in 2018/2019

Fine Gael is committed to reducing income taxes further and reducing the cost of accessing public services. This is a policy that will make life easier for more than a million people.

Taken together, this translates into the growth that will benefit every family and every citizen across the country. We love our country, and we all care for the places where we live, work, shop, socialise, exercise. There is a legitimate desire that national plans filter down to local implementation so that every part of the country benefits as we take Ireland forward together. That is the Fine Gael commitment we want to realise in this local election.

With progress, come new pressures - Work life balance, housing, transport, new and additional service and amenity requirements in localities so residents have the quality of life they deserve. In this election, Fine Gael candidates are the only ones with a plan that has your interests and your needs at heart. Fine Gael candidates are a part of a strong team at local, national and European level. With a strong Fine Gael representation in local government, with your help, we can work for your best future.

Fine Gael is the only party that can achieve an ambition we all want for Ireland – to have a strong economy and society in which nobody feels left out, with family at its centre, that is technologically responsive, has lower carbon emissions and a highly skilled workforce.

This manifesto outlines these priorities and the Project Ireland 2040 plan that will reach into every parish in every part of the country. Fine Gael is working to provide a strong economy and society in which nobody feels left out, that allows everyone put down roots, access education, start a business or take up a job, feel safe and well. Fine Gael’s plan provides certainty that all of this is possible close to home. Together, we can take Ireland forward.

On 24th May Fine Gael Council candidates are asking for your Number 1 Vote. By voting Number 1 for Fine Gael you have certainty that you are voting for the strongest team with a plan as we take Ireland forward together:

1. ACCOUNTABLE, TRANSPARENT DECISION MAKING
• Democratically elected mayors of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dublin – To ensure more effective delivery by a representative of the people.
• Greater Budget Transparency – Every Council will provide a statement of accounts to every homeowner and ratepayer; you are entitled to know how your money is spent.
• A Fair Local Property Tax – No change until 2021; No increases unless money is ringfenced for specific local projects and services.

2. MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESS
• More Housing – Increase number of new homes built every year to 35,000 and increase provision of new social housing to 12,000 a year.
• Maximise Public Transport & Cycling – Pursue investment plans for better bus and rail services, better and safer facilities for cycling and walking to benefit citizens and business.
• Improve Local Roads – Increase funding for local roads, footpaths and the Local Improvement Scheme.
• More High-Speed Broadband – Every home, school and business in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband.
• Fairer Commercial Rates – Give Councillors the power to vary local rates to encourage new jobs and business.
• Safer Society – More community Gardai and strengthened Joint Policing Committees, and more funding for CCTV in communities.

3. BRINGING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER
• Prioritising Play and Recreation – More open spaces, playgrounds, greenways across the countr.
• Town and Village Renewal – Support community leaders and initiatives that bring vibrancy to their areas Improve local environment and amenities, promote tourism, commercial and local initiatives.
• Exploit Tourism and Sports potential – Drive Councils to develop tourist attractions and sporting facilities.

4. PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT
• Leading on Climate Action – Ensure Councils adapt ambitious mitigation and adaptation programmes.
• Cracking down on Illegal Dumping – Introduce SMART enforcement of our waste laws such as use of drones to identify illegal activity.
• Creating Clear Air Zones – Introduce “higher air quality zones” to restrict the burning of certain fuels, limit high emission vehicles, and other measures to raise standards of air quality.


Making Local Government Work For You

1. DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYORS

Fine Gael is firmly committed to further increasing the powers, responsibilities and capacity of Local Authorities. We believe that decisions that affect your locality should be made locally.

With this in mind in three Local Authority areas (Cork city, Limerick and Waterford city and county Councils), plebiscites are being held to ask voters if they wish to have a popularly elected mayor. The intent is to ensure more accountability and effective delivery by a representative of the people.

The mayor would provide leadership to their Local Authority and assume the majority of the functions currently carried out by the Chief Executive (such as proposing the budget, the development plan, the works programme, Part 8 housing developments, but not functions relating to individual planning or housing allocations, enforcement and staffing matters). For example, the mayor would play a significant role in strengthening public engagement in the development of strategic planning policy through the development plan and local area plan making processes. The mayor will represent the city/county locally, nationally and internationally.

If approved by the electorate in 24th May, legislation will be brought forward to allow for directly elected mayors to take up office in 2022.

Fine Gael is also committed to a directly mayor for Dublin. As this mayor would represent four Local Authorities (Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council, Dun-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council), as well as a role on national bodies with specific Dublin remits, such as the National Transport Authority, it requires further consideration and consultation as to how best to proceed in a way that enjoys a broad consensus of support. Therefore, Fine Gael in Government is establishing a Dublin Citizens’ Assembly to consider what type of local government structure and directly elected mayor, if any, would be most appropriate to Dublin. The Assembly will convene in September of this year. Depending on the outcome of the Citizens’ Assembly, a plebiscite will be held on the subject in 2021.

2. BUDGET TRANSPARENCY

Homeowners and businesses fund local government and are entitled to know how their money has been spent.

So, Fine Gael will require each Council to publish an annual statement of accounts to all homeowners and ratepayers giving a breakdown of how revenue was collected and how it was spent. A detailed account of expenditure will be published online with hard copies available for those who wish.

3. MORE FEMALE REPRESENTATION

Fine Gael in government introduced gender quotas in general elections and this has been a major driver of increased female representation in the Dáil.

In order to encourage greater female representation and diversity, we are now introducing new measures to incentivise parties to run greater numbers of female candidates in the local elections. This includes additional funding to political parties who reach the 30% gender quota; in rural counties that have some of the lowest female representation, a pilot project will be launched to facilitate women to engage the resources and training needed for a role in politics.

Fine Gael is determined to increase the number of female voices at all levels of politics. In this 2019 election, Fine Gael is the first Party to break the 100 female local election candidate mark. In fact, 118 women are running for Fine Gael. We are attracting an extremely high calibre of female candidates because Fine Gael is a party that has a strong team, a plan for the future and is the Party that gets things done.

4. WORKING TOGETHER WITH NEIGHBOURING COUNCILS

Across Ireland, there are eight large cities and towns whose catchment areas spills into a neighbouring county.

They are Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drogheda, Portarlington, Limerick City and Waterford City. This creates specific challenges to manage the development of those towns and cities. Fine Gael will legislate for the creation of Urban Area Committees and development of a Local Area Plan for the relevant area. The new Urban Area Committees would consist of an equal number of Council members in both counties, as well as the Cathaoirleach of each Local Authority. This legislation will also include provision for participation, on a non-voting basis, for experts in the areas such as transport, housing and economic development.

Delivering More Homes

Fine Gael is the party of home ownership and it is our mission to ensure that home ownership becomes achievable and affordable again for many who today feel it is beyond their reach.

In making this a reality, Fine Gael is determined to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Separate to the overinflated and oversupplied property market left by Fianna Fáil, the sprawl that took place over the last twenty years, where housing was built far from people’s places of employment, was a major and avoidable mistake. It has resulted in parents spending hours in traffic when they should be with their children. By prioritising new development within the infill or hinterland of existing urban centres, we know we can breathe new life into our city, town, and village centres.

With our Councillors, Fine Gael will make planning guidelines that facilitate greater density in city and town centres as well as in the immediate catchment of public transport. Above all, Fine Gael Councillors will support more housing – social, for purchase, affordable, for rent – in their Local Authority areas.

5. LOCAL PROPERTY TAX TO PART-FINANCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

The Local Property Tax raises approximately €500m for Local Authorities every year and is spent on vital services and amenities like local roads, footpaths, lighting, open spaces, parks, community centres and fire services. So, we want to make sure this revenue base is not undermined as that would have a severe impact on these services.

Fine Gael at a national and local level is committed to a fair Local Property Tax. Due to the significant increase of property values across Ireland since the LPT was introduced, the Government deferred the revaluation of properties due to occur this year. There will be no change in the LPT paid by homeowners until 2021 and most homeowners will see no increase or a very modest one in 2021. This deferral is to build consensus for changes to the LPT which delivers on the following conditions:
• Fairness;
• That any increases in the LPT being charged are modest, affordable and fair;
• Allowing Local Authorities to retain all monies raised in their county or city Council;
• An annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer to ensure that counties that have a lower LPT base are financially supported as is currently the case; and
• Greater discretion for Councillors to adjust the LPT rate for their own area, moving beyond their current ability to raise or decrease the rate by 15%.

Fine Gael Councillors will work to ensure that, where possible, the LPT rate levied by the Council is reduced. Upward local Council adjustments will only be approved by Fine Gael Councillors where it will deliver new specific and additional services – e.g. more street cleaning, greater CCTV for communities.

6. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENTS

Reaching 35,000 homes a year

In 2018, 18,000 new homes were built in Ireland, the highest level of output this decade.

We anticipate up to 25,000 new homes being built in 2019. From next year on, we will keep increasing the number of new homes being built with the aim of reaching 35,000 new homes per annum. This level of output will ensure that enough homes are being provided for a growing population and to catch up on recent years without repeating the mistakes of the past.

Delivering more affordable housing

The most efficient way to provide affordable housing is to increase supply, in particular the supply of starter family homes as well as apartments. However, there are people, particularly living in and around our major cities who are earning good wages, do not qualify for social housing, but are also unable to afford to buy their own homes on the open market. To tackle this, Fine Gael is investing taxpayers’ money to:
• Service Council land so that Affordable Housing Scheme homes can be built on that land, and then sold at a discount to people, with the Local Authority retaining an equity share in the home. This €310m allocation will provide 6,200 new homes over the next three years
• Bring vacant and underutilised state land into use for housing, primarily through the Land Development Agency. Where this is done, at least 30% of those homes will be made available through an Affordable Housing Scheme, while at least 10% will be for social housing. The balance will be made available to private homeowners.

Fine Gael Councillors in every Local Authority are committed to delivering more affordable homes.

Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan

€200m was allocated for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan over three years, however, the scheme has proven to be more successful than originally anticipated. By the end of March, €106m had been drawn down, helping 575 individuals and families buy their first home. Fine Gael is committed to further funding for the scheme. Specific allocations to Local Authorities for 2019 will be finalised shortly. The scheme remains open and all Local Authorities should continue to receive and process applications up to and including drawdown of funding, as appropriate.

Homes in Rural Ireland

Fine Gael recognises the importance of living in rural Ireland and in building better homes and communities outside our major urban areas.

Our rural settlements are suitable for a low-density approach to development and tailored design approaches for each local area are needed. Fine Gael Councillors are committed to the National Planning Framework to ‘develop a programme for ‘new homes in small towns and villages’ with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities to provide serviced sites with appropriate infrastructure to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.’

Fine Gael will take a practical approach to ‘one-off’ housing which recognises that in rural Ireland many people seek to have an opportunity to build their own homes to live, to work and to rear their families in their local community.

Encouraging apartments to be built in our urban centres

Construction of new apartments has more than doubled in the last three years, with 2,372 apartments built in 2018. The Government has introduced new rules to enable higher density and taller apartment developments that are sympathetic to their surroundings, to increase availability and decrease costs. Fine Gael is committed to enabling more apartment living in urban centres, close to where many people work and wish to live their daily lives.

A rental sector with long-term security for tenants and landlords

We know that the vast majority of landlords are responsible and that almost 70% of landlords have just one apartment.

Over the past two years, Fine Gael has significantly strengthened protections for tenants and brought in rent pressure zones. We are introducing sanctions for breaching the rent caps, bringing in rent transparency, and requiring longer notice periods for tenants when their lease ends. Fine Gael has is providing additional funds to the Residential Tenancies Board to increase its staff and enforcement ability, thereby allowing it to protect vulnerable tenants better and pursue rogue landlords.

7. A LAND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY THAT DELIVERS

The Land Development Agency, with capital of €1.25 billion behind it, is a step change in the State’s involvement in the housing market. It will enable the building of thousands of new homes. That includes social housing, affordable housing, private housing and cost rental housing on both publicly and privately-owned land.

Established in September 2018, the work of the LDA is progressing with work on sites in Dublin city and county, Nass, Mullingar, Galway and Cork to deliver 3,000 homes on publicly owned lands.

Over the next twenty years, the LDA is tasked with delivering 150,000 homes across the country. A central part of this will be for the LDA to work closely with Local Authorities to identify locations for future housing growth and for the LDA to develop and promote those sites. It will ensure that any uplift in the value of land accrues to the State and can be reinvested in communities, rather than going to private land developers.

In areas of high long-term housing demand Fine Gael Councillors will insist that the Local Authority works directly with the LDA to actively identify locations of future development potential, for those sites to be master planned and developed, and then housing provided. This approach ensures that there is a long-term supply of good quality housing coming on stream and prevent the historic problems of supply – either too much or too little- that has contributed to successive housing crises.

8. PROVIDING 12,000 NEW SOCIAL HOMES EACH YEAR

In 2018 the number of social homes was increased by over 8,000 through new builds, renovations, acquisitions and long-term leasing. This will rise to 10,000 in 2019 and by 2021 reach 12,000. So between now and 2027, more than 112,000 new social homes will be added to the public housing stock. This will be one of the biggest local housing programmes in Ireland’s history. The commitment to maintain this level of investment into the medium term will ensure that the mistakes of the past do not recur. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that social housing is provided as efficiently and quickly as possible.

Developing cost rental as a real option

Fine Gael is determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live as well as work. Cost rental are schemes whereby tenants pay a rent that is closer to the cost of developing and maintaining the property and is designed to be lower than the market rent. Two cost rental projects are being led by Dublin City Council and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Learning from these projects, Fine Gael through its national and local representation will seek to expand the cost rental model in all our cities.

9. DISCOURAGING LAND HOARDING & VACANT PROPERTIES

The hoarding of zoned land and the non-use of vacant properties is a contributor to the housing crisis. The Vacant Site Levy was introduced by Fine Gael in government. It is a site activation measure focused on bringing vacant land in urban areas back into use. The penalty is a 3% levy on such properties left vacant in 2018 rising to 7% for those left vacant in 2019. Local Authorities are responsible for the implementation of the levy, and Fine Gael Councillors are committed to bringing vacant lands into more beneficial use, in particular housing.

Fine Gael in Government has introduced a Vacant Homes Officer in every Local Authority and implemented a Vacant Homes Action Plan. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that the wide range of existing tools to bring vacant housing back into use are maximised. For example, there are grants and incentives such as the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme or the Long-term Leasing Initiative.

Currently Local Authorities have a wide range of powers in relation to compulsory purchase, which have been used well in some counties to bring vacant properties back into use. Fine Gael Councillors will work to ensure that their Local Authority use their powers effectively.


10. HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OUR AGEING POPULATION

The policy statement ‘Housing Options for Our Ageing Population’ provides a framework for the creation of more liveable, sustainable and resource effective housing options for older people in every part of the country.

Fine Gael has been working to develop different types of supported housing or housing with care so that older people will have options to choose accommodation that is suited to their needs in their localities. The aim is to ensure that people can grow old and live in a community of their choosing, with dignity and independence. Fine Gael Councillors will progress the outcome of the engagement to provide greater housing and care choice for people as they grow older.

Vibrant Cities, Towns & Villages

By establishing the Department of Community and Rural Development in 2017, we demonstrated our ambition to back local communities in every part of Ireland, urban and rural. The creation of the new Department reflected a deliberate shift and pro-active approach to ensuring economic recovery and investment is accelerated in rural and urban areas, market towns and villages that have not experienced economic recovery to the same extent as our cities.

Sligo

‘Project Ireland 2040’ - our plan for growth for every part of Ireland

Balanced regional development is at the heart of the Government’s ‘Project Ireland 2040’ Plan and there is scope for the growth of all towns in Ireland. The Project Ireland 2040 Plan ensures sustainable growth over the next twenty years in all parts of Ireland. We are working hard to ensure a more effective balance of development across our country, with the intention that all regions grow at broadly comparable rates.

We want to build up the cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and Galway with each being targeted for population growth of more than 50%, twice the growth range projected for Dublin. Towns with key regional functions such as Athlone in the midlands, Sligo in the north-west, as well as the cross border city-regions of the future like Letterkenny-Derry and Drogheda-Dundalk-Newry will be growth centres under our Plan. Stretching from Kerry to Donegal, the Atlantic Economic Corridor initiative will promote economic development along the western seaboard. It will maximise the assets of the region, better utilise the economic hubs and catchments to attract investment, job creation and contribute to an improved quality of life for people who live in the region.

In tandem with this Plan, the largest ever dedicated funding for urban and rural regeneration and development has been established by Fine Gael in Government. With the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 plan and funding we can reach our aim - to strengthen the social and economic fabric of all our cities, towns and villages so that they are well placed to benefit from growth and opportunity.

To harness this potential, a one-size fits all approach will not work. Fine Gael is therefore also ensuring supports for business, communities, local groups and individuals in the following ways:

11. QUALITY JOBS, ENTERPRISE & INFRASTRUCTURE

Growing the Regional and Local Economy

There are now more people at work than ever in the history of the State. Over 154,000 jobs have been created 2016. Almost two-thirds of these new jobs have been created outside of Dublin. This is the balance of growth that helps reinvigorate regional towns, gives workers greater choice and ensure the economic progress is spread evenly across the country.

Fine Gael is not complacent about job creation. The Government’s new Jobs Plan, Future Jobs Ireland, seeks to future proof our economy by focusing on the quality and sustainability of all jobs. In February, enterprise plans for each of the 9 regions were published – again one size does not fit all. They do share one core focus – bringing Councils, state agencies, third level institutions and local stakeholders together to maximise job and enterprise potential around the country. As well as local jobs targets, we will provide competitive funding to boost regional enterprise projects, help deliver further advance facilities by IDA, and create new opportunities and collaboration between business and the new Technological Universities.

Assisting the growth of our local economies, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund - with a budget of €2bn over 10 years - will help to rejuvenate significant but underused areas in Ireland’s five cities and other large towns with populations over 10,000. The funding seeks to stimulate new residential and commercial developments, along with new services and amenities.

The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund - with a budget of €1bn over 10 years - aims to revitalise parts of rural Ireland by supporting self-sustaining projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000. These projects in sectors such as tourism, agri-food and recreation, will have a knock on economic and social benefit.

The opportunities from both funds are immense (see below for examples of successful projects to date). Fine Gael Councillors and Local Authorities have been to the fore in bringing groups together to bid for project funding. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that Local Authorities remain active in their collaborations with the public and private sector and civil society groups to access and deliver innovative responses that will lift our communities and futures.
> Funding for large scale strategic sites on both sides of the river in the Tivoli/Cork Docklands Regeneration areas.
> Regeneration for O’Connell Street and projects in the city centre of Limerick.
> The regeneration of Athenry Town, including the completion of the existing Bia Innovator Campus, driving entrepreneurship opportunities.
> A national mountain-biking project that will develop recreational facilities in four locations across seven counties (Offaly, Laois, Sligo, Dublin, Wicklow, Limerick Cork) promoting economic tourism potential.

Arts and Culture

Arts and cultural events are a central part of life in Ireland’s cities, towns and villages, providing both a focal point for local communities and making an important contribution to economic and tourist activity. Fine Gael Councillors will work with the main funders of arts and cultural events including the Arts Council, Local Authorities and Culture Ireland to ensure the continued development of world-class national and local festivals and events. Fine Gael in Government will continue to ensure capital funding is made available for the development of theatres, museums and arts centres.

Nightlife and the night-time economy

A vibrant and diverse night-life is an important part of the cultural offering of any urban area. It makes our towns and cities more attractive and interesting places to live and helps attract domestic and international tourists. Fine Gael wants to see the establishment of local committees and ‘night mayors’ to advance and improve our night time entertainment, creative and cultural offerings. Consideration will be given to licensing regulations, venue availability and changes will be balanced with the needs of residential areas.

Supporting Galway 2020

Fine Gael will work with the Galway 2020 board and executive team to drive the project forward in 2019, maximising the funding available and ensuring the expertise and creativity required for a successful 2020 programme is in place.

Consultation on Poolbeg Stacks

The disused Poolbeg Stacks are a symbol of Dublin City and are still owned by the ESB. Fine Gael will launch a public competition for proposals on their future use.

Commitment to Cork Events Centre

The vibrancy of Cork already plays an important national and international role. The Cork Events Centre will be key to providing space for the arts, culture and conference activities. Our Councillors will work in partnership with Cork City Council and Government to deliver this project.

A stronger Local Enterprise Office (LEO)

Fine Gael is committed to our small, local, indigenous businesses. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and established a network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). Five years on, the LEOs have proven a remarkable success in assisting small business and creating jobs in every county, urban, suburban and rural. In order to build on this success, we have increased the budget for the LEOs by 25% for 2019.

Fine Gael is also determined to expand the powers of the Local Enterprise Offices so they can further encourage local job creation. At present, the LEOs can only provide direct grants to businesses with 10 employees or less while Enterprise Ireland usually target larger companies who have exporting potential. This means a cohort of businesses with more than 10 employees operating exclusively in the domestic market are currently not eligible for LEO’s expertise. Fine Gael wants to change this.

With our Councillors, Fine Gael will ensure all ambitious companies, regardless of their size, have access to LEOs. As part of Future Jobs Ireland, we will strengthen the capacity of Local Enterprise Offices to provide a comprehensive range of tools for indigenous Irish businesses and entrepreneurs.

Fine Gael Councillors will demand more ambitious jobs creation targets are met in each county and that further attention is given to boost more start-up businesses.

Fine Gael wants to ensure that new and local businesses are able to avail of the many benefits from having an online presence. We have introduced a new pilot competitive scheme for eligible SMEs in the retail sector. The new scheme will allow retailers to strengthen their online trading capabilities in order to compete internationally. This is in addition to the Trading Online Voucher Scheme available through the Local Enterprise Office.

High speed broadband

Fine Gael will ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland - regardless of how remote or rural - has access to high speed broadband. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investment across Ireland; and a State intervention in those areas, mostly rural areas, where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.

In 2016, 50% of Irish premises (homes, businesses and farms) had access to high-speed broadband. Today, that stands at 75%. The last 25% are the most isolated and difficult to reach. Fine Gael will ensure that every part of the country can partake in the digital future and the opportunities that presents.

For premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be implemented through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to overcome obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.

Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and Local Authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in Local Authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards by ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. We will ensure that a local digital strategy for each Local Authority area is developed so that the benefits of infrastructure development under the National Broadband Plan are fully realised economically and socially.

Local Authorities can play a much bigger role in communications. Fine Gael Councillors will work to ensure that Local Authorities:
• Enable street lighting to be used for the purposes of siting small cell technologies, which would greatly improve the speed of 5G rollout.
• Share lists of all scheduled Road Improvements and provide reasonable access to Local Authority infrastructure to all Telecom operators to assist in scheduling of network improvements and installation of essential infrastructure.
• Agree a standardised procedure for seeking planning permission for new mast sites –including: taking account of County Development Plan, pre-planning meetings and standardised Application Pack.

Education and skills as drivers of balanced regional development

Fine Gael is investing in education because we believe education in the single best route to a better life. Almost €10 billion is being invested in education this year – our highest ever budget. This means smaller class sizes, more subject choice at second level, and much wider options for students at third level, from apprenticeships to the newly established Technological Universities.

We will make multi-campus Technological Universities a driver of regional development; provide greater choice to students by strengthening the further education options to build the skill base of sustainable regional sectors. TU Dublin was established in January this year and TU Munster submitted their application in February. We also support the application for a TU for the south east region and Connaught Ulster.

We believe that Education and Training Boards in every part of the country can drive balance regional development. They will achieve this by providing key resources to boost strong enterprises with a skilled workforce and innovative services, capable of building diversified and sustainable markets.

Affordable and accessible childcare

For the first time ever there are more than 200,000 children benefiting from childcare initiatives across the country. In November this year, the new National Childcare Scheme will commence and is designed to extend further subsidies and quality services to parents. Ensuring greater accessibility for families to childcare is also a priority. With the support of City/County Childcare Committees, increased capital funding allows for the creation of new childcare places by providers.

12. SUPPORTING AND DEVELOPING OUR AGRI-FOOD & FISHERIES SECTOR

Brexit

Fine Gael remains deeply committed to supporting and developing our agri-food and Fisheries sectors.

Brexit is the biggest challenge facing Irish farmers, fishermen and the food industry and Fine Gael’s focus in Brexit negotiations has been to maintain as close to current arrangements as possible, both in terms of trade and access to fishing waters. Fine Gael is working with the European Commission to ensure the traditional market supports and exceptional aid provisions under the Common Agricultural Policy will be made available to assist farmers, as well as increased flexibility under State Aid regulations, in a no-deal Brexit scenario. We are fully committed to supporting farmers and fishermen through the challenges ahead.

A new CAP

An adequate budget for the CAP post 2020 will be vitally important to support farmers in the years ahead, in a post Brexit environment. Fine Gael is prepared to increase Ireland’s net contribution to the EU, but only if core policies, including the CAP, are protected.

In the period 2014-2020 Fine Gael delivered investment of €12.5bn in EU and exchequer funding for the agriculture sector under the Common Agricultural Policy. This has allowed us to invest in every locality across the country. Fine Gael is committed to securing a good deal post 2020 to continue this investment in rural areas through a range of farm gate schemes. This will allow us to build on the supports we have provided to date for farmers and rural communities and rural infrastructure. We will also ensure a greater focus on climate action and environmental protection in the new CAP.

Fisheries and coastal communities

The Government has doubled the funding available under the European Maritime Fisheries Fund for fishermen and coastal communities, investing €240m in the fisheries sector over the period 2014-2020. We are investing in sustainability and the protection of fishing stocks,

Howth harbor

securing fish stocks for the long-term in the interests of both fishermen and the environment. Fine Gael is also investing in harbour infrastructure, providing fishermen and coastal communities with better fishing and marine leisure facilities. The rollout of schemes such as the FLAG programme in coastal communities is also encouraging job creation and social wellbeing in local fishing communities across the country.

Protecting the rural environment

Farmers and fishermen are custodians of the rural and coastal environment. We will deliver further progress on climate action, supporting the ambition of the new CAP which proposes to direct 40% of funding towards environmental and climate action measures. We are investing millions of euro in measures aimed at protecting the rural environment such as afforestation, beef genomics, carbon footprinting farms, agri-environment schemes, knowledge transfer measures, water quality, solar equipment on farms, organics and the removal of plastics from the waters around Ireland. We must and will do more to protect our natural resources for future generations.

13. TOWN, VILLAGE, MAIN STREET ENHANCEMENT

The creation of the Department of Community and Rural Development has added momentum to the work of communities, Chambers and other groups by helping to develop inclusive and sustainable projects around the country. These measures and initiatives are wide ranging and significant in the impact they make towards community engagement, regeneration and revitalisation.

All Fine Gael Councillors will work towards the development and implementation of Local Authority-led tailored masterplans. These plans will ensure that our cities, towns and villages are well positioned to utilise the wide variety of funding streams available. Fine Gael Councillors are strong advocates and encourage participation by Local Authorities and community groups in these funding streams.

We firmly believe in a ground up approach and it is vital that these plans and initiatives are developed in close consultation with local residents, Chamber of Commerce, Town Teams, who are best placed to identify the needs in their own locality.

Financial supports for every community

The Town and Village Renewal Scheme seeks to improve a local environment and amenities, promote the potential for tourism and as a commercial centre in the interests of residents, businesses and visitors. Initiatives such as the development of an education and enterprise hub and community centre (Glenamaddy, Galway), a fitout of a business hub in an old bank building (Edgeworthstown, Longford), and the development of playground tourism (Kildavin, Carlow) help increase sustainability as a place to live and work. €53m has been allocated for this scheme since 2016 alone. Fine Gael Councillors advocate strongly for Council utilisation of these schemes.

The LEADER Programme is a well-known scheme for rural environment, enterprise development and social inclusion projects for both individuals and groups. Over 1,700 projects have been approved for funding since 2016.

Together with the CLAR Scheme, which seeks to attract people to live and work in areas of population decline through small infrastructure projects, towns and villages are receiving greater investment. It is a priority of Fine Gael Councillors that these investments become a tangible benefit to local residents and communities. Fine Gael is entirely committed to the continuation of these schemes.


Play and outdoor recreation

Fine Gael recognises the critical developmental and social importance of providing play and recreation spaces for children and young people. We are committed to ensuring the development, refurbishment as well as new and innovative play and recreation spaces for families. In 2019, Fine Gael in government has increased funding for projects under the Capital Grant Scheme for Play and Recreation by €10,000 to €30,000. Together with local community groups, Fine Gael Councillors continue to press for the provision of more play facilities in their areas and their upgrade. We are committed to increasing funding to Local Authorities on an annual basis.

Providing more outdoor recreation amenities ranging from outdoor gym equipment to walk/ cycleways and greenways has been a priority for Fine Gael. Over 600 projects have been invested in less than three years. The benefits are obvious – residents have recreational opportunities close to home, and visitors are attracted to the area which has knock on business advantages.

This is a priority for Fine Gael. We are committed to increasing and promoting the benefits of play and recreation for children and families across the country.

Heritage buildings

Heritage-led regeneration brings economic benefits enabling our historic towns to prosper through increased visitor numbers and decreased numbers of vacant buildings and commercial premises. Assistance available to Local Authorities and community groups allows for enhancement, repair and conservation of historic and important buildings in our towns and cities. Fine Gael Councillors are committed to leveraging these funds for localities to ensure long term benefits such as increased visitor throughput, business and employment development as well as enhancing the local landscape for residents and preserving communities’ built heritage.

Commercial rates

The Local Government Rates Bill 2018 provides for the modernisation of the legislation governing commercial rates, which currently dates back to the 19th century. Included in the provisions are:
• the removal of the requirement for ratepayers to pay their annual bill in two instalments (moieties) and provision to allow ratepayers to pay rates by instalments or a payment plan agreed with the Local Authority;
• schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties;
• the levying of interest on unpaid and overdue rates;
• the rendering of unpaid rates to be a charge on relevant property; and
• In particular it provides for Local Authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support specific national and Local Authority policy objectives. This will be a reserved function of Councillors. This will be an important mechanism to allow Councillors to introduce alleviation schemes, for example, to reinvigorate town and village centres across the country which in many locations have been disrupted, to say the least, by the construction of large out-of-town developments. The Bill will be enacted later this year.

Enhanced community support

While many towns have bounced back economically from the recession, there are others in need of further targeted support.

Since 2015, the Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme (SICAP) has assisted 110,000 people and 5,000 groups. Real results have come from the programme including:
• 5,801 people got new jobs;
• 15,900 new businesses, creating 1,695 full-time new jobs;
• 9,700 higher education qualifications
• 38,300 people participated in lifelong learning courses
• 12,473 young people no in employment, education or training were supported

Fine Gael is committed to ensuring significant funding is put behind this and other programmes such as CLAR, LEADER and the Community Enhancement. Potential projects that can benefit neighbourhoods and reinvigorate the locality with the backing of Local Authorities includes renovation of community centres and amenities, improvements to town parks, CCTV equipment and energy efficiency initiatives. Fine Gael Councillors will work to ensure that their locality has an equal opportunity to gain from these schemes.

Alcohol and substance misuse in our communities

Unfortunately, alcohol and drug misuse takes place across our country and its impact is felt by every community. The 24 Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play an important role in identifying local need, channelling funding, and ensuring co-ordinated action to deliver a targeted response in communities. Services on the ground are delivered by the HSE, Drug and Alcohol Taskforces, as well as Community and Voluntary Sector organisations. Fine Gael is committed through the National Drugs Strategy to pursue a health-led rather than a criminal justice approach to drug and alcohol misuse.

In order to reduce drug-related intimidation, work is ongoing to strengthen the effectiveness and public awareness of the drug-related intimidation reporting programme by An Garda Síochána and the National Family Support Network.

Healthcare close to home

Sláintecare is all about delivering care closer to home. This year the Government launched a €20m Sláintecare Integration Fund to encourage initiatives to deliver integrated care and the shift to community care. We will build on this in the coming years. Under Sláintcare, Fine Gael in Government is delivering a number of key initiatives to benefit local communities:
• The new agreement with GPs will see a 40% increase in funding for General Practice over the next four years. This will benefit patients and support GP practices across the country. It includes moving more services to primary care and widening access to free and subsidised health care, including extending free GP care to children aged 6 to 12.
• Around the country, there are now 127 Primary Health Care Centres, with the majority of these delivered by Fine Gael in Government at a rate of ten new openings each year. Around 80 additional centres are at various stages of development and 11 will open this year. Fine Gael Councillors will help implement Sláintecare by advocating the expansion and development primary and community care through support for a similar approach to the DEIS model in education for primary health care in designated disadvantaged areas.
• The Government is investing almost €1bn a year into mental health services around the country. This investment could not succeed without the vital support provided by community, voluntary and advocacy groups to people with mental health difficulties, their families and carers. Fine Gael in Government has recently launched a new €3 million Community Mental Health Fund to allow local groups apply for financial support for the initiatives and programmes they run.
• 17 Local Authorities, through their Local Community Development Committee, have already joined the National Healthy Cities and Counties of Ireland Network. The Healthy Ireland Fund also assists key community initiatives, including the Active School Flag, a ‘Healthy Ireland at Your Library’ initiative, Age Friendly Ireland, and Get Ireland Walking Swimming/Cycling/Running strategies developed in partnership with Sport Ireland. Fine Gael Councillors want all Local Authorities to join.
• Under Sláintecare we will deliver the right care, in the right place and at the right time.

Regional Integrated Care Organisations (RICOs) will be established enabling regionally planned care that is right for the needs of the population. In doing so, we will strengthen governance to drive improvements in performance and accountability.

Disability Inclusion

For too long in the past society has placed obstacles in the path of many of our citizens with disabilities - obstacles that prevented them reaching their potential. Fine Gael wants to give people with a disability greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs. We will continue to work with Local Authorities to ensure that the Housing Adaptation Grants are accessible and available to those who need it the most. Fine Gael Councillors will support investment and adaptations that provide improved access in towns and villages, playground, local sporting facilities to those with a disability.

Bringing communities together

The Tidy Towns Competition and more recently Men’s Sheds are two household names across Ireland. They have gone from strength to strength and will continue to be advocated for by Fine Gael at national and local level.

Local services and initiatives that enhance and sustain their communities will continue to receive Fine Gael backing. They are the backbone of our society. The Community Services Programme which provided over €40m in 2018 to more than 400 community organisations countrywide. Fine Gael Councillors will continue to endorse locally developed projects that improve the lives of dependent residents.

Successful projects providing invaluable community services include
> Tralee Community Care provides daily hot meal to older people and to a local creche and special needs school.
> Energy Action provides home insulation and energy efficiency services for older people in the Dublin area.

Realising the potential of our public libraries

A key resource across Ireland are the more than 300 public libraries under the leadership of our Local Authorities. Fine Gael in Government is committed to ensuring continued innovation and expansion of projects such as My Open Library, enhanced digital capacity, new builds and new mobile libraries. All of these projects allow out library network reach out and attract more patrons on a 24-7-365 basis.

Bringing creativity to every community and school

The Creative Ireland Programme is bringing creativity to communities across Ireland, with over 500 community-based celebrations of culture and arts taking place last year as part of Cruinniu na nÓg and Creative Schools, involving thousands of children and young people and nurturing their imaginations and inventiveness. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that their Local Authority is fully engaged with Creative Ireland over its remaining four years, in particular that their Local Authority’s Culture and Creativity Teams, ensuring that the programmes benefits are felt in a meaningful way in communities throughout Ireland.

A sustainable post office network

As communications technologies change, the role of the postal services must evolve so that they continue to serve their communities effectively. An Post’s Plan will make sure that communities across Ireland have the same access to goods as in major world cities; re-invent the post office network so every town in Ireland has a modern post office, providing the financial technology services customers need in a cashless society; develop new strategic partnerships to leverage its network.

A €30m loan to An Post has been made available to assist the renewal of the post office network and to ensure that we can continue to have 5 day per week mails delivery service. Our priority now is to look at how we can deliver new accessible services for all:
• A new Digital Assist scheme is being piloted in 10 post offices, where post offices are kitted out to help citizens engage with services online.
• Ensure we use the post office network to deliver services to those citizens who do not want to use, or are unable to use services online.
• Promote locally the “Trading Online Voucher” so local business keeps up with the changing consumer patterns
• Support community education for digital literacy
• Diversifying and growing its financial service offerings

14. IMPROVING TRANSPORT LINKS FOR ALL PARTS OF IRELAND

Fine Gael has always placed importance on accessibility for all parts of the country. This is recognised in ‘Project Ireland 2040’, which provides funding for an extensive road building programme ensuring that all parts of Ireland are linked not just to Dublin, but also to each other. It also places a particular focus on improving the access to the North-West, which was neglected when it came to roads investment during the Celtic Tiger.

Fine Gael will ensure that there is a strong pipeline of future road development projects so that there can be steady and sustainable improvements in our road network in the decades ahead.

Fine Gael is conscious that despite the strong recovery in the public finances, we have not yet reached the level of roads funding that is necessary to properly maintain our regional and local roads. The €4.5 billion in regional and local roads funding under ‘Project Ireland 2040’, in addition to the €7.3 billion regional road accessibility in national roads, will remedy this and ensure that a ‘steady state’ funding is achieved from next year.

We will work to ensure that with regard to local and regional roads, Local Authorities have the greatest level of discretion into which roads projects are prioritised and funded.

A decisive move to public transport (Trains, Trams, Buses and Bikes)

‘Project Ireland 2040’ is the first time that public transport has been placed at the heart of government expenditure and in the planning process. Over the next decade, more than €7 billion is committed to new public transport projects in our cities, while future planning and development is required to place public transport at its centre.

Fine Gael is fully committed to over the next decade delivering the BusConnects programme in Dublin, Cork and Galway. This will significantly reduce journey times on buses, provide more direct routes and make the bus a significantly more attractive prospect for commuters. It will also segregate bikes from other traffic, thereby making cycling a safer, more enjoyable, and more attractive prospect also.

Fine Gael acknowledges that real concerns have been raised with individual BusConnects routes. It is important that the National Transport Authority works with Local Authority members and communities to ensure that legitimate concerns are dealt with and resolved, while also delivering the broader benefit of the project to commuters stuck in buses and cars for hours every week.

Fine Gael in government will also ensure the delivery of the Metrolink and DART Expansion projects in the Greater Dublin Area. This will ensure that Dublin has a transport network on a par with its European and global peers. As stated in ‘Project Ireland 2040’, the new Cork Transport Strategy will evaluate the potential of a Light Rail Corridor or a Bus Rapid Transit to serve the envisaged huge increase in population in the Cork area. Further movement away from cars and towards walking, cycling, bus, tram and rail will help reduce our emissions. The decision outlined within ‘Project Ireland 2040’ to ensure that all new buses purchased for the urban bus network from mid-2019 are low emission will mean that the emissions from public transport will be reduced.

Improving Rural Transport

Fine Gael recognises the value of rural transport to rural communities, particularly for the elderly and those vulnerable to social isolation. We have expanded the Local Link service which provides safe, secure and reliable public transport in local and rural areas. In addition, Fine Gael is continuing to explore other avenues to see how rural transport can be improved for communities throughout Ireland.

Commitment to the Local Improvement Scheme

Fine Gael in Government re-established the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS). €48 million has been allocated to LIS since it was reintroduced in 2017 with over 1,100 rural roads improved in the last year. Funding will be increased in the years ahead for this important rural roads’ improvement scheme.

15. NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL TOURISM

Tourism is at the heart of the Irish economy, providing opportunities in all parts of the country urban and rural. 2018 was a record year for Irish tourism creating jobs and business revenue in all parts of the country.

Local Authorities are central to this success and Fine Gael will ensure that close partnership continues in the years ahead. At a national level, we will ensure that Tourism Ireland is supported to effectively market Ireland overseas. We will also ensure that Fáilte Ireland is enabled to increase its capital investment programme, as well its backing for festivals, events and targeted campaigns.

New routes off the Wild Atlantic Way are being developed to encourage wider touring. The Shannon Estuary Drive was completed in 2018, relieving congestion in local tourism hotspots. In addition, €1.1m has been awarded to nine projects under New Horizons grants scheme for Skellig/Connemara coasts and Aran Islands. In all 31 areas, we will ensure that Local Authorities place tourism at the centre of their economic development plans. Fine Gael Councillors will fully back their Local Authority bids for funding to develop towns in their area as ‘destination towns’ for tourists.

Over the next 4 years, €56m will be invested into delivering tourism greenways. We are determined to stimulate rural tourism opportunities and build on the success of established greenways, biking trails. Fine Gael intends to create a significant network of greenways that are attractive to domestic and foreign tourists alike and encourage longer stays in more rural areas. Fine Gael Councillors will champion projects with such tourism potential.


16. MORE SPORTING OPPORTUNITIES

In 2017, the Government approved the first ever Sports Policy for Ireland with a commitment to double the spend in sport (incl. community, high performance, Women and Disability Sports) by 2025. At the heart of this are policies to improve sporting participation and Local Authorities are central to the delivery of this. Local Authorities have a key role to play in the delivery of the public spaces and infrastructure that we need for sport and physical activity. Fine Gael will ensure that the provision of public spaces for sporting activities are to the fore of all development plans within their own Local Authority area.

Fine Gael Councillors will also demand that each Local Authority develops a local sports plan consistent with the overall vision and objectives of this National Sports Policy. These local plans will be developed and implemented in cooperation with Local Sports Partnership, clubs, communities, schools and partners within and beyond sport. In parallel, Fine Gael will ensure that each Local Authority carries out an audit of the sporting facilities within their boundaries. This audit will help identify the sporting resources available within the county, and will help ensure that future funding by central and local government is best used. Improving access to sporting facilitate to ensure the greatest level of sporting participation will be central to these local sports plans

17. FIGHTING CRIME

This year, we will see more Gardaí out on the beat through the redeployment of an additional 500 Gardaí from administrative roles to frontline policing duties, through continuing recruitment which will see 600 new recruits in 2019, and through the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CFPI) which places community policing and Garda visibility at the heart of its recommendations. In total almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda Síochána since the Garda College was reopened in 2014. It is important that the increase in Garda numbers results in effective community partnerships to reduce crime in our localities.

Each Council area has a Joint Policing Committees (JPC). Their purpose is to provide a dedicated forum to encourage consultation, cooperation and synergy on policing and crime issues between An Garda Síochána, Local Authority officials, elected representatives and the community and voluntary sectors.

The network of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) all around the country have the potential to be really valuable local forums, bringing the community together with local Gardaí to reduce crime. But, in most cases, that potential has not been realised to date. An analysis of the JPCs by the CFPI has shown that while some JPCs work particularly effectively, most do not. Fine Gael will work to change this situation and to ensure that Joint Policing Committees really work in every locality. Fine Gael Councillors will be a strong an active voice to ensure that the concerns of local people about crime are clearly communicated to An Garda Síochána so that they can be dealt with effectively.

Community CCTV

Community Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) scheme is important to communities. The CCTV scheme can be seen as an additional deterrent that helps to prevent crime and to assist the Gardaí in apprehending criminals where a crime takes place in a locality. In Government, Fine Gael has provided funding for a multiannual Community CCTV scheme, allocating €1,000,000 per annum for the period 2017-2020. The scheme assists local organisations by providing a grant of up to €40,000. Within this limit, grants of up to 60% of the total capital costs of the scheme may be awarded. Since the scheme was established, 20 Community CCTV schemes have been established in five counties.

Clarification on the impact of new data protection laws on the Community CCTV Scheme has been provided by the Data Protection Commission confirming that data protection is not a barrier to the establishment or maintenance of authorised CCTV. We will introduce new elements to the current scheme to allow communities to draw down grants to allow for the upgrading and extension of existing schemes.

Senior alert scheme

Fine Gael Councillors will advocate for the increased provision of personalised monitored alarms for older people through the Senior Alert Scheme. It provides confidence and allows independent living for many. Since the scheme began in 2015, almost 45,000 people have received approval.

Protecting Our Environment

19. LEADING ON CLIMATE ACTION

Local Authorities can be leaders in delivering climate action and set an example of how they can be in the vanguard of public service bodies responding to climate disruption.

We will shortly publish a Climate Action Plan which sets out the actions that we need to take to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate action. Fine Gael Councillors will work to make Local Authorities leaders in the public service in responding to climate disruption, and as a Year 1 priority ensure their Councils to adapt an ambitious climate mandate backed by specific programmes and regular benchmarking of performance across key areas of their Authority.

Local Authorities have a key role to play in combatting climate disruption. We will ensure that Local Authorities develop mitigation and adaptation strategies for their areas. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that local plans match Fine Gael’s national ambition to be a leader in this area. We will push Local Authorities to set new targets, including a 50% improvement in energy efficiency by 2025 (on 2009 levels).

Fine Gael is establishing regional climate action offices to enable Local Authorities to work together in responding to climate change. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that Councils work within their regional structure to:
• Audit good practice and promote mainstreaming of exemplars
• Help form networks across Local Authorities in their region to develop and implement climate initiatives (hosing stock, EV networks, modal shift, waste reduction)
• Facilitate the establishment of Sustainable Energy Communities in their area under the SEAI backed model
• Help form Climate Action Partnerships where Local Authorities partner more widely in their area (enterprise, sporting, public and voluntary sectors)
• Promote the creation of One Stop Shop access to information for citizens on waste management, energy efficiency, and climate initiatives 

The Climate Action Fund offers Local Authorities an opportunity to access additional resources for innovative actions. It has already awarded a coalition of 27 Councils up to €17.5 million to retrofit all remaining 326,000 non-LED Local Authority public lights to high efficiency LED Lanterns.

20. A CLEAN AIR STRATEGY

Air pollution is a major cause of illness and premature death. In Ireland it is estimated that there are 1,600 premature deaths due to air pollution with the overall health-related costs being over €2 billion per year.

As part of the forthcoming Clean Air Strategy, each Local Authority will have discretion to introduce “higher air quality zones” within their control. Within these high air quality zones Local Authorities will be able to restrict the burning of certain fuels, limit high emission vehicles, and other measures to maintain standards of air quality.

Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that these higher air quality zones are utilised so that we can enjoy the best quality air possible, while having regard to what is best for each local area.

21. BETTER WASTE MANAGEMENT

In accordance with the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle), and keeping in mind that 66% of Co 2 comes from materials, Fine Gael Councillors will require Local Authorities:
• To develop initiatives to reduce packaging and waste, improve the level of capture, and reduce contamination through recycling streams.
• To report on the elimination of single use plastics, resource use plans and green procurement.
• Work with the EPA to review the effectiveness of Local Authority waste enforcement through the regional offices and prioritise most pressing enforcement challenges, including a focus on sites of serious illegal waste activity and an initiative to deter illegal dumping.

We will monitor, review and implement appropriate incentives and measures to encourage residential sector to minimise output of household waste and improve recycling.

We will roll out a 2019 anti-dumping plan that will place an increased emphasis on all those who facilitate the unauthorised movement and disposal of waste. Through the Environment

Fund we will back projects across all 31 Council areas, remediating black spots and equipping Local Authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support SMART enforcement of our waste laws, including access to drones.

Our Councillors will ensure that Local Authorities prioritise illegal dumping and unaccounted for waste; construction and demolition activity and capacity challenges; dealing with sites containing illegally deposited waste. Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that Local Authorities have incorporated these priorities into their Environmental Inspection Plans.

Building on the end of the purchase single-use plastic cups, cutlery and straws for use within public bodies, Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that every Local Authority reports by endOctober 2019 on the measures it is taking to minimise waste generation and maximise recycling.

Fine Gael Councillors will ensure that each Local Authority will develop resource efficiency action plans. These plans will help staff make savings in energy and water use as well as preventing food waste and maximising recycling.

Recent decisions by countries, most notably China, to limit their intake of recycling waste increases the need for us to reduce the level of waste packaging being produced greater and also the need to increase the capacity within Ireland and the European Union for recycling to be carried out here.

"Local 2019: Green Party","THE GREEN PARTY BELIEVES IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES

We believe in livable streets and neighbourhoods where you can walk or cycle to the shops with your children or your parents.

We believe in local healthcare services that won’t send you away if you need that hearing test or repeat prescription. We believe that everyone should have access to a park or a green space, that trees and bees deserve our protection and that locally produced food should be available to everyone.

We want communities where your tap water is clean and tastes good, and we believe that almost all household waste could be reduced and recycled.

So much of this is supported by our view that local government should operate as the first and most immediate way of achieving these goals. Your councillors should speak to you and for you. They are your neighbours and friends.

That relationship matters. It is a bedrock for our democracy and we believe in working towards a system of government where local voices are heard; where they carry weight.

They carry the support and knowledge of the people they live amongst.

THE PART YOU CAN PLAY

A VISION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
• We propose to restore Town Councils as new district councils that encompass the rural hinterland of each town in such a way that every rural area is under a district council. The creation of a directly elected mayors in major urban centres with significant powers over services and budgets.
• We will work for the adoption of the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals throughout local budgets and policy development with a view to achieving social equality and climate justice.
• We propose to implement a Climate Action Plan in every local authority in the country. Delegate many of the functions of central government to local and regional authorities including aspects of the administration of health, education, Garda oversight and social welfare based on international best practice.
• Introduce the facility to call a regional or local referendum through the collection of a certain percentage of voters’ signatures (at a level set by legislation).
• Avail of the recent changes in local authority planning procedures that allow for participatory budgeting to allow communities to contribute to the development and delivery of local services.
•  Propose a Localism Bill enabling Local Authorities to transfer powers and budgets from central government in areas such as Sustainable Transport, Social Housing, Renewable Energy, Waste Management and Health Promotion.
• We will transform the Local Property Tax into a more progressive system of Site Value Tax that will dis-incentivise land hoarding and speculation.
• We propose that every local authority should create a local plan for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
• We believe that funding to Local Enterprise Offices should be ring fenced for a period of five years to allow the community and voluntary sector to develop strategic plans, based on sustainable guaranteed funding.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

We believe that people should feel a sense of security and solidarity with those around them and that they have a significant role to play in their community. The Green Party will undertake a thorough, independent review of how best to support community development activity, and of how the relationship between Government and Community and Voluntary sector might be developed and enriched.

As the Government has a major financial commitment to the largely product-centred SICAP programme until 2022, it would be best to carry out such a review in late 2021 and early 2022.

In the intervening three years the Green Party will:
• Develop a people-centered, community programme, supporting existing and emerging organisations engaged in their communities on specific issues.
• This programme will have a strong social justice focus supporting anti-poverty work and work with people experiencing disadvantage.
• It will also offer support for developing other types of activity, social, political, economic, and environmental in which the concept of community may make a positive contribution.
• The same approach to development will be applied in the promotion of new community energy, food, nature conservation, educational and enterprise support projects referenced in this document.


CLIMATE ACTION
• We will promote small locally generated power, including district heating schemes, and resale of locally generated power back into the grid, giving a return on local investment in renewable energy generation
• We propose that, within a National Strategy for Energy, local authorities have devolved and autonomous powers and resources to develop energy plans for their areas.
• The Green party aspires to the principles of passive solar design in all new buildings as a way of greatly reducing heating demands and the future proofing of existing housing stock.
• We propose that local councils lead the way in sustainable construction by budgeting for embodied energy and actively reducing the use of carbon heavy building materials.
• We will promote public transport and active travel throughout all transport and infrastructure planning decisions in order to tackle climate changing emissions.
• To support active travel and pedestrian space we propose that all urban areas in Ireland develop and implement a monthly car free day.
• We will introduce annual audits of local authority environmental performance and invest in local government environmental enforcement capacity.
• The Green party oppose the incineration of waste, as it is the destruction of what could otherwise be a useful stream of recyclable materials and is at odds to programs of reduction, reuse and recycling.

REGIONAL TOURISM
• We will create an All-Ireland Walkways Development Plan to establish long distance off-road walking and cycling routes as well as promoting sustainable, outdoor/adventure tourism.
• We will develop local Food Policy Councils and corresponding local Food Trails to build on our reputation for high quality produce.
• We will develop youth and child friendly water sports to encourage health based activity and to foster an awareness of our maritime heritage.
• We will develop a ‘Livable Cities’ framework with traffic-free areas and new parks to benefit residents and tourists. This initiative will link with developments of public and affordable housing in urban areas.
• We will develop and designate at least two new national parks to nurture our nation’s ailing biodiversity and revitalise our current parks with strategic funding to enhance indigenous natural features.
• We propose to connect Rosslare to Larne and Rosslare to Galway as two new tourist rail routes.
• Develop multi purpose accessible venues to accommate both day time and night time cultural and creative activities such as markets and events.
• Elect a Night Czar for the main cities to revitalise and develop our night time culture. Support and enhance our creative culture by building studios and works spaces for the creative community, and recognising their social & economic contributions and value. Support indigenous and local creative enterprise by actively pursuing platforms to show case their work.
• Strengthen the cultural and creative provisions and objectives in local Development Plans.

THE HOME YOU LIVE IN

The social welfare budget allows us protect people from poverty and reward those engaged in caring work which is not valued by the market.

The introduction of new automation technologies and work practices make the case for reforming our social welfare system and paying people a Basic Income which gives them greater protection and flexibility in mixing caring and working roles.

Reforming the system will not be easy but can be achieved in a step by step approach.

WASTE AND POLLUTION
• We call on the Irish Government to protect Ireland’s bee population by removing Bayer’s new harmful insecticide (Flupyradifurone) from sale in Ireland.
• We will strengthen the role and membership of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Advisory Board and propose additional legislative and funding support to the EPA to increase enforcement.
• We propose to establish a forum of appeal for the Integration Pollution Prevention and Control license system and to provide an independent route to review and redress where the EPA currently has full jurisdiction.
• We propose to resource local authorities to provide 10,000 clean drinking water outlets nationwide in an effort to reduce the use of plastic bottles of water.
• Plastering our roads with election posters clutters our public space and wastefully bombards voters. Candidates, parties and referendum campaigns should be restricted to one poster each in a number of designated areas in each local election area such as outside shopping centres and libraries.
• To deal with flooding we will create a single Emergency Response Agency involving local authorities, Government departments, Gardaí, Defence Forces, Civil Defence and emergency services in coordinated planning and response to emergency situations, particularly in relation to the Shannon Basin.
• We will adopt ecological measures to manage our river catchments to benefit communities who live and work near vulnerable areas. We advocate a regional approach to flood prevention.
• We will develop land use management plans for each river catchment in the State and begin a process of utilising land to attenuate flood waters, build natural revetment barriers and plant broadleaf forestry and willow for coppicing. We will prevent poorly regulated urbanisation which has led to construction on floodplains.
• We oppose plans to build incinerators in any location nationwide. This method of waste treatment simply creates an incentive for waste creation and a centralisation of operation, neither of which are sustainable.
• Air pollution in on the increase. We propose that a system of multiple permanent & continuous air and marine ecosystem monitoring stations be provided to all urban areas and where incinerators have been built or are proposed.
• We support local movements like Repair Café which help people to repair broken or damaged items rather than discard them, both with pop-up café events and internet resources. We propose to support this work through a repair VAT exemption.
• The Green Party proposes to implement a grants scheme supporting infrastructure for the treatment and distribution of water servicing group water schemes and sewerage disposal.We also promote the resource recovery of sewerage as an alternative to treatment and disposal.

CHILDREN AND CHILDCARE
• We propose that each local authority should undertake a review and support service for childcare buildings to ensure that all premises have the correct planning status, the appropriate space and services for childcare and that they meet all requirements for fire safety and air quality.
• We call on Local Authorities to undertake a central role in the direct provision of community based childcare on an affordable and universally accessible basis.
• We propose to make available grant schemes to facilitate the adaptation of suitably located community, youth and sports facilities to operate as after-school service providers which could also be used by community groups operating cooperative childcare.
• We believe that newly built primary and secondary schools should be designed and granted planning permission with appropriate spaces for breakfast club or afterschool/ homework club facilities.

LOCAL HEALTH SERVICES
• We will develop land use management plans for each river catchment in the State and begin a process of utilising land to attenuate flood waters, build natural revetment barriers and plant broadleaf forestry and willow for coppicing. We will prevent poorly regulated urbanisation which has led to construction on floodplains.
• We oppose plans to build incinerators in any location nationwide. This method of waste treatment simply creates an incentive for waste creation and a centralisation of operation, neither of which are sustainable.
• Air pollution in on the increase. We propose that a system of multiple permanent & continuous air and marine ecosystem monitoring stations be provided to all urban areas and where incinerators have been built or are proposed.
• We support local movements like Repair Café which help people to repair broken or damaged items rather than discard them, both with pop-up café events and internet resources. We propose to support this work through a repair VAT exemption.
• The Green Party proposes to implement a grants scheme supporting infrastructure for the treatment and distribution of water servicing group water schemes and sewerage disposal. We also promote the resource recovery of sewerage as an alternative to treatment and disposal.

EDUCATION
• We propose to work with local communities to create school Health Zones that would move car drop off points to a safe distance.
• We will undertake a review of education services at a regional level in primary, post primary, third level and continued education with specific focus on improving engagement and enrolment, accessibility for vulnerable groups and with a view to reducing fees and administrative costs that act as a barrier to entry for students.
• We will work with Education and Training Boards, and SOLAS to support the participation of people who have a disability in local training, education and activation programmes. All education service providers should appoint a Disability expert to liase with students.
• At local level we will prioritize better cycle and pedestrian access to schools in urban areas and villages, and take these into account in planning future housing and school locations. Improving healthy travel to and from school. The Green Party strongly supports the Green Flag and “walking bus” initiatives that support students choosing healthy and ecologically friendly transport to school.

A COMMUNITY YOU BELONG TO

The Green Party believes in decision making led by voters at the lowest possible level. This empowers communities and local regions to envision a future that is tailored to their own specific needs.

We advocate that the local community can take a lead in deciding how local services are provided and give them a key role in planning. Thus, decisions are made in a more transparent, accountable and democratic way.

TRANSPORT
• To facilitate multi-leg journeys, we will ensure that both public and private companies use a central bus station for inter-urban routes, located alongside other public transport modes.
• We call for the creation of an independent Public Transport Regulator within the National Transport Authority, whose remit would be to facilitate greater integration between inter-urban and local transport services
• We will push for a requirement for night-time and early-morning business deliveries, to reduce road congestion during peak commuting hours.
• We will seek the creation of local authority ‘Street Officers’, to issue both parking fines and dog fouling fines and actively patrol communities to ensure that streets and neighbourhoods are accessible to all.
• We will reduce the waiting time to a maximum of 30 seconds for pedestrian signal times and ensure that all pedestrians have adequate time to cross the road.
• We will improve the public realm in our cities, towns and villages by providing wider footpaths with quality materials and design that make it easier for people to walk instead of driving short distances.
• We propose the provision of secure and sheltered waiting spaces to all public transport hubs.
• We propose an increase in the provision of cycling parking at all transport nodes and the facilitation of cycling storage on both coach and rail lines;
• We will provide for longer cycle commutes by considerably increasing the Greenways network alongside canals and National Road corridors.
• We will establish a ‘Dublin Transport’ office to improve coordination between Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority
• We advocate an increase in the provision of Park and Ride facilities, a reduction in parking charges in under-utilised Park and Rides, and heavy discounting of tickets for monthly users.
• We propose a progressive reduction in public transport fares until they are free in con junction with the development of service capacity in public transport. This will include the expansion of free and reduced-fare public transport schemes to more sections of the population, while also prioritising rural areas.
• We propose to extend the LEAP card provisions beyond its current regional boundaries to develop a truly integrated national travel service that would offer regular commuters significant savings on travel.
• We will provide additional express buses for long-distance commutes from Drogheda, Dundalk, Mullingar, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Carlow, Arklow and Gorey.
• We will prioritise funding for the Kildare Route Project Phase 2, the Navan Railway Line and the Interconnector (DART Underground) between Spencer Dock and Inchicore. We will promote a number of key rail routes to improve access for commuters including lines in Limerick, Waterford, Sligo, and Derry.
• We will undertake an in-depth public review of a Light Rail system for the city of Galway to service its residents needs and drastically reduce Galway’s chronic traffic problems.
• We will increase bike space on our trains, with flexible space for bikes (eg fold-down seating), and put in place more car hire, bike hire and vehicle sharing schemes, at main stations.
• We will promote teleworking by allowing more local and semi-state workers to work remotely one day a week or more.

RURAL LIFE
• We propose a proactive approach to licensing local bus services by the licensing authority and the direct support of existing routes, to include school schemes and to provide capacity based on demand.
• We call for the expansion of the Rural Transport Programme and supplement it with more scheduled bus services at lower fare rates.
• We propose to place the farming community at the centre of decision making in the future development of greenway routes across the island of Ireland and will require a consultation process with local representatives, landowners and interested bodies as minimal requirement for applications.
• We will require the inclusion of cycle and walking lanes in all road planning assessments across Ireland, where appropriate, and in keeping with local concerns.
• We will promote greater integration of small scale, bio diverse, forestry into farming systems.
• We will promote co-ops and market gardening; artisan food, including cheese; small-scale poultry, farm-gate enterprises and farmer markets.
• We will promote small industry, craft making by making support available through local authority advice outlets, including on starting up, premises and marketing, and through grant aid.
• We will develop more attractive living options in town centres, including above shops.
• We will facilitate the retention of post offices, Garda stations and banks, they are a vital social and infrastructural resource within communities.
• We propose to increase funding specifically to mental health/rural isolation issues, which become more significant as our population ages.
• The Green Party supports an increase in organic output from tillage and other nonanimal based products to 20% of total output by 2025.
• We advocate a 5% increase in subsidies to existing and new participants on the Organic Farming Scheme for produce in cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes and other non-live stock based outputs.
• We support the launch of a major marketing initiative to encourage consumers to buy locally-grown, pesticide free produce with a particular focus on crops and horticultural produce
• We will promote strong subsidies to local regions to support High Nature Value farming, supporting farmer incomes and increasing the intrinsic, recreational and tourism value of a better rural natural environment.
• In line with our Food Policy and our Agriculture Policy we propose to move towards more regional markets of food production and trade that would deliver greater food security for the nation.

OUR PLEDGE TO NATURE

Nature is the most valuable resource we have in the fight against climate change, and halting the collapse of biodiversity is one of our most urgent tasks. That’s why we’re making a Pledge to Nature – to protect it, to value it, and to help it flourish. We need to halt the extinction crisis, returning threatened species to healthy numbers, restoring our damaged ecosystems, and letting nature thrive.
• We believe it is the right of every citizen to have reasonable recreational access to accessible green space. We propose that every local authority should meet the European average on the provision of green spaces per capita, including parks and woodlands, roof gardens, community gardens, school allotments, forests.
• We want every local authority to recognise role of nature in our national strategy on climate action make natural solutions and native habitats one of our primary means of sequestering carbon. Ireland has less than 14% forestry cover, well below the European average of 40%. We propose to plant 1 million, native trees as part of a national biodi versity plan that would work towards 20% cover by 2022.
• We want every local authority to commit to restoring native habitats, native forests, bogs and wetlands and to designate areas for rewilding.
• We call for an immediate end to the significant spate of tree felling in urban, suburban and rural areas around the country, and for local councils to the protect nature we have with responsible and sustainable tree management in towns and cities and the effective management of hedgerows and Natura 2000 sites.
• We want local authorities to take the lead in the retention and conservation of hedge rows with appropriate species and sustainable management, and to reverse threatened and diminished biodiversity by revising section 40 of the 1996 Wildlife Act (as amended) to continue the closed period on annual hedge-cutting from 1 March to 31 August inclusive.

HOUSING PROVISION

We propose to provide a dedicated fund to each Local Authority nationwide based on relative housing needs to begin a comprehensive program of building delivering 36,000 homes per annum (30,000 net of obsolescence per annum) with a minimum requirement of 35% social housing, 35% affordable housing stock and with 12 % of the total designed to Universal Design building standards.
• Increase in funding to local authorities to acquire encumbered buy-to-let properties for social housing, through purchase or lease.
• We propose to allow Local Authorities to borrow 10% of their annual budget for building housing.
• An end to evictions for refurbishment that result in homelessness for a fixed period and the implementation of long term and ‘forever’ lease agreements to allow renters security of tenure.
• A clear definition of over-crowding in law that is meaningful and enforceable.
• We propose that all local authorities reformulate and strengthen their Housing Department so that they include both long term planning, the implementation of construction and the long term management of their housing sector without division across the authority.
• We propose to allow Credit Unions to invest in housing where their surplus funds are currently invested in overseas financing.
• We propose that local authorities would make available a percentage of land available for self build cooperative housing projects.
• We advocate a review and update to the guidance given to contracting authorities in setting appropriate criteria for tender packages.
• Allow a provision for the division of tenders where geographical location or specialism would benefit from such an action and allow for some specialist works sub contracts to be tendered for directly.

THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
• Landlords (rather than tenants) of rateable properties should be charged local business rates, whether the properties are in use or not. We believe this will discourage brownfield premises suitable for housing being left derelict by speculating owners.
• We propose that, where relevant structures exist and in particular in the case of housing, the retrofit of buildings is the standard base proposal for review before redevelopment is considered.
• We propose reform of the amended Planning and Development Act 2000; increase penalties on public representatives who subvert the planning process for personal gain; the reintroduction of planning reviews at council level; a review of the Part 8 planning clause; the provision of the average industrial wage for all local city and county councillors in return for increases in role responsibilities..
• We propose a three year time cap on developer maintained shared areas in new housing estates where planned handover has not taken place to the local authority. Where developers have not completed works agreed in granted planning permission they will be liable for a cumulative levy to enable residents and local authorities to negotiate completion and recoup costs or decouple completed sections from continuing construction areas.
• We propose that the state identify key communities at risk of gentrification to ensure that direct supports and available safeguards are fully in operation in those areas. We propose that in those communities in danger of becoming unaffordable for local populations the social housing requirement is increased to 35% for all new housing developments.
• The Green Party supports the development of a compulsory public register of all publically and privately-owned land and all options on land.
• The Green Party recognises that conserving the visual fabric of a community is more complex than maintaining any buildings featuring on the national list of protected structures. Social significance, historic resonance, folklore, community usage and even plot size are all currently undervalued and under reported in current planning decisions. We propose that this aspect of planning is given increased significance in the new local authority housing and planning departments we seek to create.

POLICING IN OUR COMMUNITIES
• The Green Party recommends the rapid rollout of Community Policing Teams across the country.
• The Green Party recommends that Community Policing Officers should only be withdrawn from their roles in particularly urgent situations. Policing of large sporting or musical events should not warrant their withdrawal.

The Green Party believes that Joint Policing Committees and local authorities can make an important contribution to creating greater local accountability of An Garda Síochána regarding both monitoring its effectiveness and guiding the establishment of policing priorities within local authority areas.

In order to achieve this, the Green Party recommends a number of changes to the operation of JPCs:
• Oversight of local policing activity should be clearly listed as a reserved function of local authorities.
• Operations of JPCs should be standardised across all local authorities. Meetings should be treated on par with meetings of the county council: broadcast live online, full minutes of meetings should be accessible to the public online within a reasonable time period and the public should be entitled to attend. There should be at least six meetings per year.
• Statistical data needs to be provided to members of a JPC independently of the local Garda stations.
• Where a JPC identifies issues, there should be a clear mechanism whereby the Gardai at local level set out their response and what way they plan to address the issue. If the issue cannot be addressed at local level, there needs to be a clear method of escalating the concern to higher levels within Garda Síochána, and there should be obligations to provide responses to these escalations.

"Local 2019: Labour","Foreword

Labour’s pledge is to achieve stronger, better local government that serves the whole community and improves everyone’s lives. Local government can and should help everyone to be active in shaping and improving the place where they live.

Our Councillors know how to make local government work for the benefit of people and communities. Labour has delivered 107 years of public service in local government: we have provided housing, maintained roads and street lighting, and managed waste and recycling, and we have given everyone access to parks and green spaces, provided libraries and cultural centres, and helped promote local jobs and businesses.

Labour wants to make local public services genuinely public again by bringing them back under the direct control of elected councils, to ensure higher quality services and better working conditions.

Some of Labour’s ambitions for strong local government require legislation that we are striving to achieve at national level. Not least, we have advanced a law in the Dáil to restore Town Councils.

Labour’s vision of a fairer, more equal society begins in towns, cities and rural areas across Ireland. We want everyone to be securely housed, and we want every area to be a good place to live, to raise a family and to grow older. Local councils can be part of the solution to provide affordable, accessible housing for everyone who needs it.

Local government must lead action on climate change too, from insulating council buildings and promoting the local generation of electricity, through to building cycling infrastructure and improving recycling facilities.

I am personally delighted that Labour is putting forward so many excellent candidates to serve their communities, with a great mix of experienced councillors and new candidates.

Local government matters to everyone’s quality of life. And voting Labour this May will help ensure that local government truly serves the whole community.


1. Getting the Basics Right

Labour Councillors understand the job of local government, and we get it done well.

Local councils deliver the basic things that matter to people, like clean streets and parks, road repairs, street lighting and recycling facilities.

Labour believes local councils should provide local services, to provide better quality services and better value to the public. We will return control of local services to our local councils because outsourcing and privatising vital services often does not deliver value for money or good quality, and workers’ pay and conditions are very often worse. Labour will fight for decent pay and conditions, and the right to trade union representation, for any worker working directly for local councils or contracted by them.

HOW WE WILL GET THE BASICS RIGHT:

We will demand that a larger portion of your local council budget is allocated to the basics, so that they are delivered for everyone, in every community

With proper investment we can see improvements in public lighting, street furniture, and the design and upkeep of paths and roads to cater for cyclists and pedestrians as a priority, including for buggies and people using mobility aids

We think that it is important that we see quality standards and continuous improvement across everything local councils do. We think it is important that our local councils are meeting key targets

We will:

Call for ambitious performance improvement targets for each local council

Call for a greater exchange of know-how between local councils, so that councils can learn from best practice

Many European countries are taking back control of basic services – like waste collection and road repairs – or never privatised them in the first place. We’ll insist that local councils provide services directly rather than contract them out to private companies

We’ll improve the quality of waste collection by direct employment by local councils where possible, and strong enforcement of regulations on private operators

Labour councillors know the importance of having someone respond to local concerns. We will seek to establish a new role of Community Warden to be a familiar face in every locality. Community Wardens would keep an eye out for antisocial behaviour and be quick to respond to issues like illegal dumping, dog fouling, persistent noise or anti-social behaviour, with the power to issue fines

We will increase the number of people working as litter wardens, traffic wardens or dog wardens

We’ll call for zero tolerance on dog fouling and introduce intensive enforcement “brown zones” for streets and roads where persistent offending occurs

We’ll make sure local council services are accessible to all

If you want to deal with your local council in Irish, we will make sure that there is someone able to help you with your request

We’ll encourage local councils to produce materials in Plain English to meet the needs of people who do not have strong English or who have literacy problems

We will work with local council officials to ensure that their websites are fully accessible for people with additional needs

We will:

Work with local council officials to ensure that council websites meet the standards of the EU accessibility directive (guaranteeing that persons with sight, hearing or dexterity needs can use local council websites as two-way communication portals)

Advocate for mandatory disability equality training for all local council staff, to include understanding of autism, mental health issues and learning difficulties, for example to simplify application forms

Seek for more weekend services for people with disabilities, especially in rural areas where many supports are only available on weekdays

2. Leadership on the Environment 19 and Climate Action

Labour is committed to real change to Ireland’s economy so that we are less reliant on fossil fuels. This is incredibly ambitious but failure is not an option.

The climate emergency is now, but we can meet the 60 million tonne challenge: the challenge of reducing our collective greenhouse gas emissions from 60 million tonnes every year to net zero in just 30 years. Labour gets it, and we understand how local government can promote action on the environment and provide leadership for communities and businesses to become sustainable.

HOW WE WILL LEAD ON THE ENVIRONMENT:

It is time for greater local council leadership on climate change. That’s why we are calling for there to be Climate Action Committees on every council to drive an ambitious agenda to reduce carbon emissions and to ensure sustainability

We’ll call for specific Climate Action Funds to be allocated in each Council budget, to finance practical ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

We want an ambitious State-led programme to insulate over 100,000 homes a year, including existing council housing. Insulating homes helps reduce energy poverty as people save money on their energy costs. A national insulation programme also has the benefit of reducing Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions

We will seek more investment in flood protection for Irish cities and towns that need protection against extreme weather events

We’ll make sure that local councils improve their recycling facilities. We need to make it easier for people to recycle plastic items. We will explore the option of setting up local deposit schemes on certain bottles and containers

We will:

Help our citizens reduce their reliance on single-use plastic bottles by ensuring that there are water fountains available in Council buildings such as libraries and community centres

Take action on food waste at local level, to minimise food spoilage and to encourage the redistribution of surplus food by producers and retailers

Promote an expansion in the collection of organic waste from people’s homes

Councils need to have Just Transition plans for every local area to show how new good jobs will be created to replace jobs that are linked to fossil fuels. There needs to be a Green New Deal to support new sustainable jobs, to reduce energy poverty and to increase access to sustainable public transport

Apprenticeships and training schemes should be established so more workers have the skills for jobs linked to environmental sustainability

Energy poverty can affect older people and people with disabilities who may need to use more home heating. We will set up schemes to combat this

Labour will call for councils to publish their carbon emissions as part of their annual reports and for local Carbon Budgets to be aligned with the National Carbon Budget

Local councils should be ambitious when it comes to their role in renewable energy uses. It is possible for council properties and land to be used to generate wind and solar power

Communities should be given access to the national electricity grid, to enable

them to generate renewable energy such as wind and solar as a contribution to meeting local electricity needs and reducing Ireland’s carbon emissions

We’ll seek strict planning guidelines to overcome concerns about wind farms

Labour Councillors will make sure that city and county development plans include initiatives that improve our infrastructure for public transport, cycling and walking in order to reduce our reliance on cars

Greater investment is needed to improve and promote walking and cycling facilities. We’ll call for continuous and segregated bike lines through urban centres, safe counter-flow cycle lanes, secure cycle stands in towns and at schools, and safe routes for schoolchildren cycling to school

We believe that 10% of the national transport budget should go into improving our cycling infrastructure. Councils should appoint dedicated cycling officers to promote cycling and insist in the planning and improvement of new cycling and existing routes

Labour has delivered the public Dublin Bike scheme and extended similar schemes to Cork, Limerick and Galway. We believe that these schemes should be extended to all parts of Dublin, not just within the city boundaries. The catchment areas should also be widened in Cork, Limerick and Galway, and the scheme extended to other urban areas

More people than ever are using electric cars. We need to make sure charging points are more widely available, particularly in rural Ireland

We will work with local councils and An Garda Síochána to seek to regularise the responsible use of electric scooters

We support a strategic overhaul of bus transport in Dublin, while we will also advocate for revisions to the BusConnects plan where it has failed to take legitimate local concerns into account

We believe that any contractor receiving public funds should be kept to high environmental standards. All local councils should insist on stronger environmental conditions as part of any contract they issue

The Labour Party will insist that all water services remain in public ownership

Local councils have a role in protecting public land and must do more to protect against illegal dumping and pollution, and enhancing the lands through cultivating a balanced range of native species

Members of the public should be able to access public land for leisure activities

We’ll call for local councils to implement mixed species afforestation and peatland restoration on lands in their control, which will support the direct and indirect creation of sustainable jobs in rural areas

Local councils should report on species diversity in their areas in their annual reports and outline how they plan to protect and enhance habitats to ensure that the populations of nativ species are sustainable

Modern technology allows us to use forensic science to find out who is responsible for dumping, littering, dog fouling and pollution. Illegal dumping is a scourge on many communities. We think more effective enforcement is needed to help stamp out these problems

Local councils should have more powers to control air pollution, as councils are best placed to restrict the activities that cause air pollution

Local councils should work in tandem with local farmers and Education and Training Boards to make land available for allotments and community gardens

We will support the development of more greenways and blueways to support leisure activities and tourism

3. Building Housing 19 and Supporting Tenants

The Labour Party will give local councils the resources they need to end the homelessness crisis.

Labour has developed a new model of public housing that is open to everyone, based on what people can afford to pay, in order to solve the problem of housing costs. In addition to the scandal of homelessness, lack of access to decent, affordable housing is a slow moving crisis that leaves hundreds of thousands of people unable to move ahead with their lives. House prices and private rents have increased at a much faster rate than people’s take home pay. Many young people are living in the family home or else they are renting for more than they can really afford. In previous generations, they would have bought their own homes.

Labour’s solution is the same as what Labour parties have delivered throughout European cities for decades: good quality housing, built by local councils, and rented out at a fair, affordable rent to people from a wide range of backgrounds. More than two-thirds of people living in Vienna rent publicly-provided housing (“cost-rental housing”) and this is a normal housing option right across Europe. The great State-led house-building programmes of the 1940s, 1950s and 1970s owe a lot to the role of Labour, and this can be done again to deliver affordable public housing in our towns and cities.

Labour has a proud record of ensuring planning decisions that benefit the whole community, not narrow commercial interests. Labour Councillors were to the forefront of exposing corruption and campaigning against land speculation and developer-led planning. Labour will fight for good quality planning and development, and to restore planning powers to local government.

HOW WE WILL PROVIDE HOUSING FOR ALL:

Labour representatives in both local and national Government will continue to campaign for proper investment in housing. If the Government followed Labour’s plan for housing, there would be an investment of €16 billion, over five years. This would deliver 80,000 homes under a new model of public housing open to all.

Labour Party Councillors will push for a mixture of traditional council housing and affordable public housing under the cost-rental model to a wide range of people on different incomes, operating under new rules, with opportunities for affordable home ownership

More one- and two-bedroom units of public housing need to be made available

We will introduce binding social housing building targets for councils to respond to local housing needs, and to reduce inefficient spending on Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) tenancies

There needs to be more homes available to those who have additional needs.

All new public homes provided by local councils should be built according to universal design principles and accessible by people who use mobility aids. Older buildings need to be brought into compliance with accessibility standards

Higher-rise apartment developments need to have high minimum standards of build quality, services and maintenance. Local councils should have the responsibility to enforce these standards

The turnaround time to bring back vacant housing and voids needs to be improved in many local councils. Labour councillors will ensure that funds are allocated to help shorten turnaround times

We recognise that a higher percentage of social housing allocations need to urgently go to people with high needs, including people who are homeless, people with health problems and families with children

Many people with disabilities and additional needs are currently living in inappropriate accommodation. Labour will provide supports for people with disabilities moving out of congregated institutional settings

It’s time for local councils to launch an ambitious programme of retrofitting for council homes and buildings

Labour Councillors will work with local councils to ensure repairs to council homes are carried out within three months

There needs to be stronger democracy for tenants and owner-occupiers of apartment buildings and housing estates, to give them control over management companies and a greater say in the management of common areas

Stronger regulation of the private rented sector is needed in order to give more rights and protection to the thousands of people who rent

Labour believes in rent control. Stronger rent control legislation is needed

For many older tenants, security of tenure can be a cause of great anxiety. Labour wants to increase the certainty of tenure for older people in private rented housing

Labour wants to support those single-property landlords who comply with the laws that are in place. We will provide incentives to landlords who provide longterm tenancies and fair rent

The decision by Fine Gael to alter the planning powers of local councils was shameful. The Labour Party wants to see planning powers back where they belong, in local government. Labour councillors have always and will continue to fight for good planning decisions that benefit the whole community, not the narrow commercial interests of the few

Labour Councillors will properly engage with local communities when development plans are being drawn up

Large-scale housing developments should not be granted planning permission without proper services around them, that is why Labour representatives will insist on the provision for schools, public transport, health care, community facilities and other services

Commercial developments must have public transport provision before they are granted planning permission

Labour Councillors will fight for the preservation of sufficient green space and public parks in urban areas, and advocate for the preservation of green belts between existing urban areas

Local councils need to have stronger compulsory purchase powers for the development of housing. Councils should be empowered to impose large fines on those who leave buildings and land vacant for unacceptable periods of time

The Labour Party supports legislation for the compulsory purchase of lands at existing use value, building on the 1973 Kenny Report proposals

Vibrant main streets should be the centre of all activity in towns and villages.

Labour will promote schemes to enable the temporary use of empty shops by artists and community groups

Funds are needed from central Government to offset the additional cost of development of housing in brownfield urban sites as opposed to greenfield sites

We’ll extend the rules on preventing dereliction to include occupied buildings as well as derelict ones

When it comes to solving the housing crisis, we should innovate. Labour will explore options for new forms of home building, especially where this provides additional homes in areas with few remaining sites

Labour will lead a national conversation about how we can plan for old age in a way that maximises people’s independence in sheltered housing and ensures their access to local shops and services

A growing percentage of public housing needs to be dedicated to older people

We will design housing and neighbourhoods to support the growing number of people likely to be affected by dementia in future

Labour will seek the expansion of “empty nester” schemes to assist older people to sell their homes to the council, in exchange for housing that is easier for them to manage

4. Improving Quality 19 of Life for All

Labour wants every place to be a good place to live for everyone, with a special focus on the needs of children and older people.

In most of our communities, local councils provide and look after parks, beaches, playgrounds, sporting facilities, libraries and art centres. Their quality, safety and accessibility can be lifeenhancing for people in terms of physical and mental health. The lack of these facilities can also diminish people’s quality of life.

We have a vision of how local government can raise the quality of life in every town, city, suburb and rural area, by providing access to good quality facilities.

WE WILL PROMOTE LOCAL SERVICES TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL:

Our cities and towns should not be overly focused on commercial concerns. Vibrant cities and towns need to be focused on people’s needs. We will promote liveable towns and cities, and advocate for a European-style culture of comfortable urban living and quality urban housing

We’ll explore schemes for the retrofitting of multiple above-the-shop dwellings in town and city centres into single, integrated housing projects that can have proper access, operating independently of owners/occupiers of ground floor retail premises

Everyone deserves to have easy access to clean, healthy environments like parks, outdoor gym equipment, sports grounds, swimming pools, children’s playgrounds, hill walks, beaches and woods, including for dog owners and for people practising sports

Young people need to have places to go. We will create spaces such as recreation areas, community buildings and youth cafés in council buildings, with the aim of encouraging community leadership and social participation by young people

It is common sense for local councils to have responsibility for the delivery of rural public transport. Labour will push for local councils to be able to fund these types of services, building on the Local Link pilot

Subsidies need to be made available for rural hackney/taxi schemes, to ensure people in rural areas can access shops and services in neighbouring villages and towns. Making more rural hackney taxi licences available will help to reduce the incidence of drink driving

We believe libraries and arts centres should have longer opening hours, especially at evenings, weekends and on bank holidays

We are passionate about the promotion of literacy programmes, that’s why we will heavily promote outreach initiatives by libraries and arts centres targeted at marginalised and disadvantaged groups, including people with literacy or learning difficulties, to encourage their use of these facilities

We’ll enhance the role of libraries as resource hubs for people seeking training or work, or seeking to set up their own businesses

Library programmes that promote computer and Internet literacy are really beneficial to people in our communities, especially for the oldest and youngest in our society. These types of programmes can help people avoid being caught by Internet scams while also promoting safety online

Libraries are a great resource for students, especially those doing exams. Labour councillors will promote funding for homework clubs to take place in libraries and community centres, run by community development workers

We’ll support the use of mobile libraries, especially in rural areas

All Councils should be empowered to work with the communities they serve. Labour Councillors will ensure that your local council is co-operating meaningfully with community, voluntary and neighbourhood groups that work to enhance people’s lives

We will work with local councils to make it easier for community groups to overcome barriers like insurance costs and accessing event permits

We want all neighbourhoods to have access to affordable, and where possible free-of-charge, public spaces for use by community groups. Labour will promote the use of public buildings after hours by non-profit community groups

There needs to be more opportunities for people to be active citizens, especially for people from minority groups, people with disabilities and others who are under-represented in public life

Labour has a track record of supporting our community arts organisations and promoting inclusive community cultural activities. We will continue to do so right across the county

We fully support traditional Irish festivals and parades, including promotion of the Irish language

The benefits of local policing forums when it comes to combating crime cannot be denied. Labour will work to improve the relationship between local councils and the Gardaí, and to promote community policing

More Home Security schemes need to be put in place to help people, especially older members of our community, upgrade the locks and security systems on their homes

Rural crime is on the rise, and many communities are rightly extremely worried.

Labour funded the rural CCTV scheme, and we want to see it developed further to deter crime and speeding

The Community Graffiti Reduction Programme needs to be re-established. Labour will provide funding and assistance for public bodies, community groups and/ or businesses to remove graffiti, to improve landscapes and to divert young people into community arts activities including graffiti art zones, while also calling for a minimum age to purchase spray paint

Make Way Days are brilliant for highlighting the challenges people with disabilities have to overcome while living in our towns and cities. However, we cannot just have one specified day a year where we are made aware of these problems. Labour will work towards making all shared spaces designated as safe travel areas for older people, children and persons with disabilities

We need to make our roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. That’s why we will continue to advocate for policies to maximise road safety for pedestrians and cyclists, including more pedestrian crossings, with a particular focus on disability access on all footpaths and crossings

Town and city centres should be designed to be walkable spaces, not dominated by cars

Working with local councils and An Garda Síochána we will come up with solutions to controlling the unlawful and dangerous use of scrambler motorcycles on public roads and on public land

Ireland is a vibrant multi-faith country. While upholding the principle of State secularism and pluralism we will support religious communities when they wish to hold festivals in line with their faiths

We will support religious communities in attaining planning permission for churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and other religious buildings

We’ll call for all local councils to ensure appropriate burial grounds are available for people of all faiths and for people who are not religious, including those who wish to build new forms of burial ground such as walls for interring the remains of those who have been cremated

5. Supporting Workers’ Rights, 19 Jobs and Enterprise

Working in partnership with trade unions and local businesses, Labour will enhance the economic role of local councils, to provide decent and sustainable local jobs. We will insist on good employment practices and environmental protection.

Local government provides the necessary building blocks for enterprise and job creation: good planning; roads; control of waste and recycling; permits and authorisation; and by implementing local economic plans. Good quality jobs are the best way to reduce poverty and to improve workers’ wages.

Local councils purchase a large amount of goods and services from the private sector, including major construction contracts. We want to see the full use of EU rules that permit social and environmental clauses to be put into contacts, to require: decent wages; local employment; more apprenticeships; good environmental protection; and other gains for local communities.

Labour has a vision for Ireland’s economy post-Brexit, based on environmental sustainability and good quality jobs. Brexit has made it clear that Ireland’s exporters need to move beyond reliance on the UK market alone. We want stronger indigenous Irish enterprise and better linkages with multinationals and with enterprises across the EU. We also must move away from fossil fuels, while replacing jobs that are affected by this transition.

HOW WE WILL SUPPORT WORKERS’ RIGHTS, JOBS AND ENTERPRISE:

Labour will demand that all local councils provide decent pay and conditions to their employees and to anyone contracted to deliver goods or services

There needs to be much stronger social clauses in all local council contracts and procurement, with requirements for decent pay and conditions, paying the Living Wage as the minimum. Council employees and contracted employees must have the right to trade union recognition and collective bargaining

We will work with local councils to ensure that their economic plans are focused on creating sustainable jobs, especially in rural areas and disadvantaged urban areas

Labour councillors are extremely supportive of LoveLocal campaigns. We will support initiatives to ensure the viability of local towns and community shopping streets. There are many way we can do this such as making sure councils provide affordable parking, helping the establishment of local business associations and promoting farmers’ markets

There needs to be better and more affordable public transport links to local shops and services in towns, as an alternative out of town shopping centres. Public transport must be accessible to all who wish to use it

It’s time that public transport providers took their responsibility to local communities more seriously. There should be proper upkeep of transport shelters. Labour councillors will insist on disability-accessible bus stops and shelters, with correct timetables

We know that many businesses are running into difficulties with the levels of local council rates. We will review the effect of local council rates on the ability of local shops and services in order to allow local businesses to complete with online shopping

The rate at which the high-speed broadband is being rolled out in rural Ireland is far too slow. We will seek for local councils to advance the availability of broadband Internet in towns and hubs

We will improve roads and other transport infrastructure that are under local government control, and require harbour plans to be developed

We will encourage all towns to develop local Fair Trade initiatives and Living Wage initiatives

We’ll promote the development of Nightlife Commissioners in urban areas to support the development of the night economy while ensuring public safety and noise control is kept in check. Night Commissioners could explore ways of financially supporting late night venues that are not viable on a purely commercial basis, as well as ensuring evening activities are available for teenagers as a socialising option, such as night time sports

Childcare can be completely unaffordable for so many families. Local councils could and should have a greater role in the provision of affordable childcare facilities

6. Delivering Labour’s Vision 19 of Equality and Fairness

Labour Councillors in local government have always used their powers to advance equality and fairness. Labour will push local councils to meet their public sector duty to eliminate discrimination, promote equality and protect human rights in their daily work.

Decency, equality and justice are made real whenever local government ensures everyone is securely housed and when every neighbourhood is a good place to live, to raise children and to grow older.

HOW WE WILL DELIVER EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES:

The Labour Party fully stands behind the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These goals include eliminating poverty, hunger and inequality. We will make sure they are all included in councils’ long-term strategies, budgets, performance indicators and reports

The powers of local government must be used to improve the lives of people in the most disadvantaged areas

Local Councils need to publish statistics on poverty, deprivation, unemployment, disability, age profile and the number of households on low fixed incomes as part of their annual reports and strategies

At all levels of local and national government, Labour has always been the strongest advocate for greater gender equality

It is time for local councils to adopt gender budgeting practices in their annual budget processes

Labour TDs and Senators will push for statutory quotas for more equal representation of both women and men as candidates for election at local level

Local councils should be leaders when it comes to reporting on gender pay gaps.

We will call for each council to publish statistics on its own workforce in terms of the gender of employees at every grade, the gender pay gap, the employment of ethnic minorities, the employment of people with disabilities, and the employment of people from other minorities

We’ll seek a greater proportion of women to be employed at management level in local government

Labour councillors will continue to advocate for local councils to show leadership by actively encouraging breastfeeding by mothers in all their premises

Labour councillors have been leading the charge when it comes to convincing local councils to provide free sanitary products in their buildings. In the next council term, we will continue this work

It is critical that every local council has adequate provision of refuge accommodation to support people, mostly women and children, fleeing domestic violence

We will make sure that that local councils show flexibility and sensitivity towards victims of domestic violence (some of whom may have tenancies or joint ownership of a home) so that they are not barred from local council housing and then forced to choose between homelessness and returning to an abusive home

Support families and children

Children and families must have access to community-based arts and cultural activities

Local Councils should support schools to provide meals at lunchtime. This will ensure that every disadvantaged child has a hot nutritious meal every school day

Support LGBT+ communities

We will continue to support LGBT+ Parades held in local areas and ensure that their routes are visible

We will ensure that more local councils are LGBT+ friendly places to work or use services, and use the leadership role of local government to combat discrimination or bullying

Support Ireland’s ethnic minority communities

Local councils should reach out more to new communities, through information and education initiatives, in order to foster social inclusion and intercultural understanding

We will make sure the necessary support is there for people from minority communities to hold festivals and other events celebrating their culture and traditions, and support access to public buildings for community activities

We’ll collaborate with local communities to support the successful integration of refugees

We will encourage local councils to use their enterprise role to support shops and other businesses set up by people from ethnic minorities

It’s important for a greater number of ethnic minorities, including Travellers, to be employed by local councils, and we’ll push councils to work with Travellers to ensure better job opportunities

We will demand all funds for Traveller housing are drawn down and used at local level

Support people with disabilities

We will demand that all new local council policies, developments and services are disability proofed, meaning that the effects on people with disabilities should be clearly identified and given due consideration during the planning phases

We’ll seek safe and unimpeded access for people with disabilities on all footpaths and to all public buildings, and we’ll advocate for a greater number of people with disabilities to be employed by local councils

7. Strengthening 19 Local Democracy

Labour wants to strengthen every elected Council’s ability to decide important matters at local level.

Too much power has been centralised in Government Buildings. Only 8% of public spending is under the control over local government here, compared to a European average of 23% and more than half of all spending in some countries. Many smaller European countries have much stronger local government than Ireland, and give local representatives a greater say over education, health, policing, social services and transport.

Labour wants more public money to be under the control of local government rather than being controlled from the centre. With greater financial autonomy comes greater responsibility, and we will promote transparency and greater accountability to local people.

Stronger local democracy also means ending the situation where public agencies by-pass elected local councils when making decisions that impact on local people. Labour wants both local council management and the management of other public agencies to be required to answer the questions of elected local Councillors, to ensure accountability to residents for all public services provided locally.

HOW WE WILL MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRONGER:

We will call for a Citizens’ Assembly to be set up to discuss a new model of stronger local government, and how to fund it

Up to 20% of public spending should be under the control of local government, with the relevant powers over education, social care, employment affairs, policing and transport to be devolved to local government

Too often, central government and its agencies create unnecessary delays for local councils, such as for council housing projects. We will seek to reduce these delays

We will restore Town Councils to every urban area with a population over 5,000 and 1,000+ dwellings

We will reconfigure existing Municipal Districts to cover the areas not covered by Town Councils

Coherent town plans must recognise the centrality of towns as social and economic hubs. To do this we will restore the role of town architects, and seek special status and supports for the largest towns, such as Drogheda, so that they can develop into well-planned cities

We’ll research the possibility of establishing smaller-scale Borough Councils in

Dublin, to replace the existing four local councils in the event of a Greater Dublin Council being established for County Dublin under a directly-elected mayor, with these borough councils having functions and powers analogous to Town Councils

Labour representatives will continue to speak truth to power and to seek greater accountability of public bodies

We believe that public agencies that make decisions that impact on local people should be accountable to local councils

It is vital that local council Chief Executives are held accountable for their actions.

We would reduce the range of decisions that Chief Executives can make without reference to elected representatives

We will encourage and support Labour Councillors to use Freedom of Information requests and other mechanisms to hold to account the management of local HSE, ETBs, Gardaí, etc. for the delivery of services affecting local people

The financial independence of local councils needs to be strengthened. It is time to reduce interference by central government and other public agencies in deciding annual council budgets

Labour Councillors will continue to ensure that the public are getting the best value for money

We believe in the need to look at other countries to see how local councils deal with funding. For example, other countries allocate some tax revenue from income tax or VAT directly to local government

We will call on government agencies to pay local commercial rates as they did until the 1980s, but provide an exemption to local council archives

Labour Councillors will support the principle of a fair taxation of property/assets at local level, and seek for local councils to have greater flexibility to modify the level of Local Property Tax (LPT)

We want to avoid a sudden spike in LPT due to the revaluation of properties, for example by lowering the rate from 0.18%

We would call for a review of Site Value Tax (SVT) and its consideration as an alternative to Local Property Tax (LPT) that could promote the development of affordable housing

We need to explore options to keep 100% of LPT or SVT tax locally while creating national schemes to support poorer local council areas

We’ll advocate for councils to have the option of introducing tourist levies, to fund local arts, culture and heritage facilities and festivals

We’ll seek transparency to residents and local businesses through a Plain English annual statement about local government revenue and spending, to demonstrate value for money for commercial rates, Local Property Tax and other local taxes and charges

Ireland’s cities need to have directly-elected mayors with adequate resources so they can take on the executive powers currently held by council officials

Voters in the relevant areas need to be given clear information about the proposed powers and functions of these mayors, as well as information about how elected councils will function alongside them

The Labour Party supports a Yes vote for directly-elected mayors in local votes being held in Cork, Limerick and Waterford, on the basis of voters being given adequate information on what powers will be held by these mayors

Chief Executives should be renamed Chief Operating Officers in local councils with directly-elected mayors

As we have always done, Labour councillors will support active citizenship and participation in all communities

Local people need to be given a real chance to discuss and propose ideas for the communities they live in, that’s why we will promote “town hall” style public meetings and other productive forums that give local people a voice

We will reform Public Participation Networks to ensure they provide real benefits to local communities

Local people should get a say in how their money is spent locally. We fully support the development of participatory budgeting at local level

Meetings of the Council should rotate through different towns to increase visibility and accessibility of the Council’s deliberations

We need to encourage more diversity in the political system. We need to make it easier for local people to get involved

We will continue to encourage and support the election of candidates from different backgrounds, including to Town Councils, in order to develop the capacity of more people to consider a career in electoral politics

Labour councillors will continue to improve Maternity Leave and Paternity Leave for councillors to make the role more family friendly, and seek for substitute councillors to be co-opted during the time that a councillor is on extended Maternity Leave
",2019,"Local","Labour","Labour_2019_Local"
"Local 2019: Sinn Fein","We in Sinn Féin are leaders. We stand up for what is right, we take risks for peace and we hold the powerful to account. We fight, in local councils and in Europe, for ordinary working people and families.

We keep our word and when we say we are going to do something, we do it.

The Fine Gael government, supported by Fianna Fáil, has overseen an unfair recovery which has been to the benefit of a privileged few and left many behind. For many working people wages have stagnated and job insecurity increased while the cost of living continues to escalate.

The stress of making ends meet is putting those on low and middle incomes under increased pressure and leaving many with little or no reserve for a rainy day.

Families and young people cannot access affordable housing and the health service is in crisis while public money continues to be wasted by incompetent government ministers.

Team Sinn Féin will fight to increase incomes and reduce the cost of living, to build houses and protect homeowners from vulture funds, to make communities safer by tackling crime, to deliver better local services and to oppose punitive carbon tax hikes.

Sinn Féin wants to see a fair and prosperous Ireland.

Nobody who goes out to work every day, or is forced to stay at home through disability or because they are caring for others, should struggle to pay their bills or keep a roof over their head.

No older person should be faced with the indignity of lying on a hospital trolley when seriously ill.

Nobody should have to go to the courts to fight for their rights.

No one should live in fear in their home or community.

We will not stand for it.

We are fighting back.

We want better paid and secure jobs.

Sinn Féin will fight for you.

We want strong action on climate change but oppose carbon taxes.

We want support for rural Ireland with no community left behind.

Sinn Féin will fight for your community.

Sinn Féin will fight for Ireland.

We want affordable homes for all.

We want communities free from the fear of crime.

We will stand up for Ireland’s interests in the Brexit negotiations and believe that now is the time for Irish Unity.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SINN FÉIN PRIORITIES

RAISE INCOMES AND TACKLE THE COST OF LIVING

Fine Gael, backed by Fianna Fáil, has burdened Irish citizens with some of the highest basic living costs in the developed world.

This is not fair. Childcare which costs the same as a second mortgage, historically high levels of rent, and soaring energy charges, which are among the highest in Europe, are not normal costs for families to have to deal with. For all of these basic necessities, and more, Irish citizens are forced to pay much more than our European neighbours.

This is the result of government policies and an unwillingness to deliver high-quality and affordable public services required by citizens.

In contrast, Sinn Féin is driven by a commitment to world-class and universal public services which are already available to citizens in almost every other high-income European country. We are committed to ensuring that every worker in the state is paid a good wage for their efforts.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

A three-year freeze on rents and renter’s tax relief equivalent to one month’s rent

The abolition of the property tax by government and councils use their power to set it at the lowest rate possible

Rolling out affordable, high-quality childcare

Introduction of a real living wage for all workers

Use of social clauses to ensure local authority expenditure promotes quality employment and decent pay

Promoting trade union membership in pursuit of better pay for all

DEMAND SECURE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have taken turns creating crisis after crisis in housing. They aided and abetted the banks and developers in driving house prices through the roof. Now they watch as countless citizens are gripped by a housing and homelessness crisis. This is a disgrace.

Fine Gael’s housing policy serves only to enrich landlords, Vulture Funds and international land hoarders and investors through tax hand-outs. This government has not delivered a single affordable home, and failed miserably to build enough social homes; missing target after target. Meanwhile more and more Irish citizens fall into homelessness, and countless more see their wages gobbled up by historic rip-off rents, unable to save for a home or plan for a family.

Sinn Féin says enough is enough. Renters need a rent freeze and relief. Those in mortgage distress need compassion and assistance, not the sight of more Vulture Funds hovering overhead. Ireland’s homeless need a new approach - we all do.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Continuing to progress Pearse Doherty TD’s ‘No Consent, No Sale’ bill, to give families the power to keep their homes out of the clutches of unscrupulous Vulture Funds

A major public house building programme across the state including social homes and affordable homes for purchase and to rent

Ensuring planning processes are transparent, fair, and timely to prevent delays and blockages to home building

OPPOSE THE CARBON TAX & FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE

The threat posed by climate change is unique in scale and in nature. Never before has the island of Ireland, and the international community, faced such a profound threat to our livelihoods, our society, and our natural environment.

Unfortunately for us as Irish citizens, and our neighbours around the world, Fine Gael has one of the worst records in the developed world. Our legally binding target was 20% reduction in emissions by 2020 – Fine Gael have delivered just 1% reduction. Now they want to pass the buck for this utter failure by hiking the carbon tax on ordinary people.

We all have a responsibility to stand up for a safe climate future for our children and the coming generations of Irish citizens. Sinn Féin is rising to that responsibility, putting forward clear, direct, and effective proposals to prevent further unravelling of the climate. Our recent Climate Action Committee alternative report went further than the establishment parties in many areas. Sinn Féin proposed to invest to make the climate transition just and a real benefit for people’s lives, and by making the corporations and big polluters pay.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER BY TACKLING CRIME

We cannot expect to tackle crime and anti-social problems in our communities when successive governments have cut the heart and soul out of community safety and crime prevention initiatives.

Drug Task Forces have had their budgets slashed, and then asked to do more with less. Youth programmes and probation services have been cut too. At the same time, cuts have been inflicted on policing, causing a reduction in frontline gardaí and local Garda stations.

No community or police service can expect to overcome complex problems such as crime when their crucial supports have been ripped away from them. Worse still, the ability of citizens to scrutinise and support community policing has been undermined by inadequate Local Policing Forums and Joint Policing Committees.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Empowering citizens to support and scrutinise local policing, strengthening and building better links between Local Policing Forums, Joint Policing Committees and the communities they serve

Opposing hikes in the carbon tax

Introducing a Local Authority Climate Obligation Bill to ensure councils makes best use of land for renewable energy generation, charging points for electric vehicles, park and ride facilities and public transport

Ensuring all public housing is built to the highest energy efficiency ratings

Building on our record of delivering public bike schemes

Each council to establish an ambitious target of kilometres of cycle-lanes for delivery

Planting more broad leaf trees in parks, green spaces and on streets

Investing directly into keeping communities safer through more Gardaí on the beat, and equipping them with the best technologies and resources

Rooting out the causes of crimes with more funding towards prevention initiatives, community awareness, youth programmes, Drug Task Forces, and addiction services

DELIVER BETTER LOCAL SERVICES AND AMENITIES

Traditionally, local councils provided essential services that improved people’s lives. Successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil governments’ privatisation and outsourcing agenda has starved local authorities of the vital funding required to deliver services. This has diminished essential council services.

The privatisation of bin collections has led to the end of waiver schemes, increased costs for householders and more illegal dumping. This should return to being a core local authority service.

Councils also need to provide residents with the basic facilities to keep their communities clean and tidy. We need more public bins and dog litter bins, as well as more recycling centres that allow people reduce their waste outputs.

There are many further areas where local authorities can help relieve cost of living pressures. Whether permanent amenities or occasional events, both outdoor and indoor, the various free to use and affordable services offered by local councils can be invaluable, especially for hard-pressed parents seeking to keep their kids entertained.

Essential services such as roads, footpaths, public lighting, traffic-calming measures should be delivered as a priority. Likewise emergency services such as fire services and winter gritting require greater resources.

The Fine Gael Government, supported by Fianna Fáil, continues to underfund flood relief schemes throughout the State. The Office of Public Works, which is responsible for flood risk management, requested an additional €49 million in funding in order to implement vital programmes to up to 300 communities at significant risk of flooding. Despite this, Government has failed to provide additional funding and has cut flood relief schemes by €3 million in 2019. Sinn Féin would ensure that flood risk management is adequately funded, protecting communities and responding to a key challenge of climate change. In Government we would provide an additional €50 million to flood relief schemes in the years to 2021.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Bringing waste collection back under the control of local authorities

More recycling centres, public bins and dog litter bins

Joined-up planning and delivery of playgrounds, bmx and skate parks, gym facilities, modern libraries and many more amenities in conjunction with residential and commercial developments

That central government provide the funding identified as necessary by the OPW for the protection of communities from flooding

PROTECTING AND GROWING THE ECONOMY – BREXIT AND A UNITED IRELAND

Brexit poses a unique and historic threat to politics and prosperity on the island of Ireland. For Sinn Féin, defending the interests of the Irish people is paramount. This means protecting the Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement, and the integration of our island community.

If the DUP and the British government refuse to lift the threat of a Brexit the people of Ireland overwhelmingly oppose, and which the people of the north democratically rejected, then the only solution is to allow the people of this island to determine their future – Ireland united and prosperous in the EU, or an Ireland further divided with the north linked to the sinking Brexit ship.

As the only all-Ireland party standing in the local elections with councillors in all border councils, Sinn Féin is uniquely placed to take effective allIreland and cross-border action to mitigate against any form of Brexit and to promote Irish unity.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Establishing a €2bn Brexit Stabilisation Fund, €1bn of which will be delivered through ISIFCouncil investment partnerships, to protect our island economy from a crash-out Brexit

Encouraging further all-Ireland political and economic co-operation

Government deliver a white paper on Irish Unity and establish a forum on the issue

A referendum on the reunification of Ireland

SELECTED ACHIEVEMENTS OF SINN FÉIN COUNCILLORS

Sinn Féin councillors have used their positions effectively to fight for their communities locally and, working with our team of TDs, Seanadóirí, MEPs, MLAs, MPs and councillors from right across the whole island, they have fought on the big political issues of the day.

Sinn Féin councillors fight to ensure a progressive, republican agenda is pushed in every council chamber to which they are elected and help deliver local, regional, national and international change.

LIVING WAGE AND BETTER PAY

Sinn Féin is determined to ensure that every worker earns at least enough to live a good life, free from financial worries.

It is a scandal that some large employers in Ireland pay their workers so poorly that they must seek additional financial help from the state, while these companies post huge profits. The State subsidised low wage employers to the extent of €431m in 2018 alone.

Sinn Féin has called on the government to introduce a Living Wage of €11.90 to be immediately payable by every employer that can afford it.

To date the government has refused to ensure fair pay for workers.

In the absence of the necessary government action, Sinn Féin councillors will do what they can to encourage a fair share for workers at local level and for those employed as a result of public contracts.

Learning from the successful experience of ‘fair trade’ certificates, Sinn Féin proposes to introduce a Council accreditation scheme with Local Living Wage Employer Certificates awarded to local businesses that demonstrate the minimum wage they pay is the living wage.

Sinn Féin will also continue to work towards Social Clauses being central to any public procurement processes. This will ensure that companies who successfully win public contracts will be required to provide decent pay and conditions. These conditions include a living wage, apprenticeships, community gain, local economic benefit through local contracts, trade union recognition and quality employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These and other social criteria should be put into the core specifications of contracts put out to tender by local authorities.

Where trade unions are strong, wages are better. Sinn Féin propose councils roll out local public awareness campaigns highlighting the value of trade union membership.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Use of Social Clauses for all public contracts

Local Living Wage Employer Certificates accredited by councils

Inclusion of social criteria such as decent pay and trade union recognition in council procurement contracts

Public promotion of trade union membership by council advertising campaigns

RENT FREEZE, RENT RELIEF AND MAJOR PUBLIC HOUSING PROGRAMME

Having a suitable and secure home is increasingly out of the reach of ordinary people. Social housing waiting lists grow ever longer. The number of adults and children in emergency accommodation has reached historic highs. The cost of renting or buying a home is now out of reach for tens of thousands of people.

Households up and down the country live with the worry that they are only ever a few pay cheques away from losing the place they call home.

For those in the private rented sector there is the additional fear of rent increases or the landlord deciding to sell.

According to government figures there are 71,858 households on waiting lists for local authority housing in this state.

But in reality there are an additional 45,000 households in insecure HAP tenancies, 18,915 households on RAS, 24,303 Rent Supplement tenancies and 5,400 households in long-term private leased properties on the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme.

These families are all in need of real social housing. That’s more than 140,000 households in need of real social housing.

Many of these people are living in cramped and unsuitable conditions and, in the current system, will be waiting a very long time to be housed appropriately.

The traditional role of Local Authorities as the main providers of social housing has been undermined. Widespread use of subsidised private rental alongside low levels of investment in public housing has been the policy of choice for decades.

The government’s housing plan Rebuilding Ireland is failing.

Numbers experiencing homelessness or who are at threat of homelessness have risen starkly.

According to figures from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in February 2019 there were 10,264 people in emergency accommodation, this figure includes 3,784 children.

Social Housing output remains slow. According to the Department of Housing’s own figures just 6,861 real social houses owned and managed by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies were delivered in 2018.

Not one affordable home has been delivered via any government scheme to date.

Sinn Féin remains committed to the delivery of cost rental affordable homes and affordable homes to purchase.

Sinn Féin would push for the delivery of over

10,000 social homes per year. This government has delivered no affordable houses. Sinn Féin would initially push for the delivery of over 4,500 affordable rental and sale units per year and greatly expand this sector of the housing share.

Estate management and maintenance is a traditional area of local authority competency which has been neglected. The appearance of communities adds to people’s quality of life, so this is an area we would like to see more resources directed to.

Sinn Féin would prioritise the taking into hand of private estates where this has not been done.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Government introduce an emergency rent freeze lasting three years across the state and introduce tax relief for renters equivalent to one month’s rent

Local authorities be funded by government to deliver a major public house building programme on public land to meet social and affordable housing need

Council-led mixed income public housing estates with social, cost rental and affordable purchase homes

Reducing the time for the approval, tendering and procurement process for public housing from 18-24 months to 6-9 months

Protecting homeless funding, ending long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough.

Ensuring full and timely delivery of local Traveller Accommodation Plans

Prioritising funding of domestic violence emergency and step down accommodation and supports

Demanding of central government increasing funding for disability and wheelchair accessible adaptation grants for council tenants and private home owners to meet need and eliminate waiting lists

Prioritising delivery of one bed apartments for single households and older people looking to downsize within their own community

End to hotels and B&Bs being used for emergency accommodation

Greater investment by councils in estate management and maintenance

Ensuring an adequate supply of homes for people with disabilities and wheelchair users

COUNCILS PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES

WASTE COLLECTION

Essential household bills are crippling hundreds of thousands of ordinary people and adding to the financial insecurity of countless more. The actions and failings of government parties, both past and present, have driven these costs up.

As was predicted by Sinn Féin councillors and activists who campaigned against charges from the outset, the introduction of bin charges was followed by local authorities exiting the service.

This has led to an upsurge in illegal dumping. A recent report by the Consumer Protection

Commission in September 2018 showed that 23% of householders do not avail of a domestic waste collection service. Local authorities are having to foot the bill for cleaning up the illegal dumping.

Once upon a time bin collection was a core service provided by your local Council - now it is a lucrative industry, with the cost being borne by the householder. Beauparc Utilities Ltd, operators of Panda Waste and Greenstar enjoyed a 49% jump in pre-tax profits in 2017. This resulted in a profit of €18.4m. Meanwhile the average cost per householder has increased by 11%, to €228 since 2012. Private companies have also disregarded the waiver system that was in place. Forcing vulnerable households and those on low income to pay the full charge for waste collection.

We are now the only state in Europe with a completely privatised waste collection service. We are also the only EU state persisting with ‘side by side’ competition for waste collection. Leading to multiple companies driving through residential communities adding to pollution and traffic jams.

Our privatised system is expensive, bad for the environment and severely lacking controls and regulations.

Sinn Féin is committed to putting waste collection back under the control of local authorities. Sinn Féin would introduce the successful franchising model, already operating in several countries across Europe and eliminate the ‘side by side’ model. This would be an important first step towards a return to waste collection directly by local authorities.

This model would give power to local authorities to contract a single waste collection service for their area. The council could insist on operating standards including affordable prices for householders and waiver schemes. And the company would be accountable to the local authority on whose behalf it is operating.

This would be the first step in returning the operation of waste collection services wholly into the hands of the local authorities.

The model would also enable local authorities to better take advantage of the renewable energy potential offered by organic waste.

Sinn Féin introduced a Waste Reduction (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the Dáil in an effort to minimise waste, further promote recycling and provide for greater penalties for littering. In the absence of this necessary government action, more can be done by local authorities to tackle fly-tipping, illegal dumping (on a private and industrial scale) and dog fouling.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Putting waste collection back under the control of local authorities

End the ‘side by side’ waste collection system

Introduction of franchise model of waste collection so that councils can insist on standards of delivery including affordable prices for households and waiver schemes

Increasing the number of recycling centres and the range of items accepted, more public bins including dog litter bins

LEISURE AND RECREATION

There are further areas where local authorities can do more to relieve cost of living pressures. Whether permanent amenities or occasional events, both outdoor and indoor, the various freeto-use services offered by local councils can be invaluable especially for hard-pressed parents seeking to keep their kids entertained.

It’s vital that services are planned and delivered in a joined-up way.

Playgrounds, public parks, swimming pools, bmx parks, skate parks, arts centres, theatres, community centres, linear parks along waterways, greenways, blueways, dog parks, gym facilities (indoor and outdoor), community gardens, forestries, walkways, biodiversity parks, libraries etc. should be delivered in conjunction with residential and commercial development - to create healthy and sustainable communities.

Sinn Féin is eager to see much more of this.

Local authorities have worked successfully with Local Sports Partnerships to promote participation in sport at all levels through the promotion of mass participation events.

However, during the recession funding for local amenities such as parks, swimming pools and libraries were cut, Sinn Féin councillors have been to the fore in working with local communities to oppose these cuts and have services reinstated.

Sinn Féin will advocate the full exercise of all local powers and use our collective strength to lobby for additional resources to ensure that each community has equal access to basic public arts, sports, cultural and recreational services and amenities as a right.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Joined-up planning and delivery of sports and recreational services and amenities

Increased funding for Sports Capital Grants, and additional weighting for clubs and organisations based in disadvantaged areas, including increased support for applicants applying for grants

ESSENTIAL AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

Essential services such as roads, footpaths, public lighting, traffic calming measures (especially in built up areas and at schools) should be delivered as a priority and as standard.

Many local and secondary road networks are crumbling and the countryside in particular is beset by accident black spots that regularly claim lives. Most cities and towns also lack adequate provision for pedestrians making it dangerous to even cross a road, particularly for the elderly, people with disabilities and those with prams or small children. Resources and consideration at local authority level can contribute to improving all of this.

Sinn Féin see the potential for Local Authorities to assume a 'Lead Planning' role whereby they could co-ordinate local development with other state agencies to ensure co-ordinated development of areas e.g. school places, public transport routes, Garda resources, etc.

Provision of emergency services is a key function of local authorities. Local authorities have responsibility for fire services (and ambulances in parts of Dublin). Increased investment in fire services and personnel is urgently needed. Ultimately, Sinn Féin would establish a National Fire Authority across the 32 counties that is adequately resourced to ensure adequate cover for the entire country. Having a national authority would also allow for investment to be made in the frontline services which save lives while also freeing up existing local authority money for other services.

Winter gritting is another important responsibility of local authorities. Additional investment in sand boxes, snow ploughs, gritters, etc. is needed and additional gritting routes should be added.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Increased funding from central government for local authority essential and emergency services including fire services and winter gritting

The creation of an all-Ireland National Fire Authority

Improving infrastructure for cycling and walking in both urban and rural areas to ensure people can travel safely.

Initiating local road network accident black spot audits and ensure that councils take appropriate measures.

CLIMATE ACTION AND OPPOSING CARBON TAX INCREASES

We need to tackle the catastrophic reality of climate change in a way that delivers justice and fairness to all. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party have suggested increasing the carbon tax from €20 per tonne to €80 per tonne. This could increase the cost of the tax for middle income households to €750 per year.

Sinn Féin believe the bills faced by ordinary people are already too big. If carbon emission reduction targets are to be achieved fairly, there must be a broad suite of effective policy measures that make climate friendly alternatives truly accessible and affordable to all.

The switch to renewable and low cost alternatives energy sources should be a benefit to households, not a burden. Measures must be taken such as allowing for households to generate their own energy through wind or solar power to be able to sell excess power back to the grid as provided for by Sinn Féin’s microgeneration Bill.

There is also massive potential to allow for community ownership of energy production.

Fairly raised Government investment is needed to reduce people’s bills and enable behaviour change eg through free insulation and retrofits, through making electric cars affordable and by developing the charging infrastructure as well as through public transport expansion and fare reductions.

We must clean up after Fine Gael’s climate failures. Greater public investment in transport, energy efficiency, renewable energies and in sustainable growth in local communities is the way forward.

In the Dáil, Sinn Féin are introducing a Local Authority Climate Obligation Bill to ensure each local authority takes stock of all their land that can be used for the generation of renewable energy, to create electric vehicle charging points, to create supply lines of organic waste material for the production of biogas and to develop public transport and cycle lanes. It would also ensure that local authorities seek to produce their own energy, build homes of the highest energy standards, and facilitate the collection of organic waste and compost.

Local authorities should learn from exciting initiatives undertaken overseas, for example urban forests created in Barcelona.

All of this would help to ensure local authorities play their part in pursuit of a carbon neutral society.

Sinn Féin recognises that there is an urgent need to prevent flooding in Cork City, such as the devastating floods of 2009, and are committed to providing a Flood Relief Solution. We acknowledge the significant research done by Save Cork City in identifying the potential impact on Heritage and disruption to city centre business, and in providing an analysis of the OPW proposals. In government, we would instigate an Independent Review of the current OPW plans, conducted by an independent Internationally recognized expert.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

No carbon tax hikes

Greater public investment in transport, energy efficiency and renewable energies

Councils to identify land available for renewable energy projects, electric vehicle charging points, public transport and cycle lanes

All local authority housing to be built to highest energy standards

Local authorities to plant more broad leaf trees in parks, green spaces and on streets to improve air quality, aid carbon sequestration and make urban settings more beautiful.

BUS SERVICES

Commuting times, accessibility and affordability of public transport all impact directly on the cost of living and quality of life of ordinary people.

Sinn Féin is deeply concerned by the government’s ham-fisted efforts to redesign the Dublin bus network. Under the BusConnects route culling proposals thousands of Dubliners living in the suburbs stand to lose their direct bus to the city centre, to their schools, colleges and hospitals.

There are also potential problems with service frequency reductions and moving bus stops from residential areas and no guarantee that the necessary investment to enable improvements will be forthcoming. These changes have the potential to hit vulnerable transport users hardest, such as the elderly and people with disabilities.

Sinn Féin have called for a further round of consultation on the plan and believe that a formal standing mechanism to ensure input from all stakeholders including representatives of the NTA, Dublin Bus, bus users, drivers and local councilors should be established.

It is unacceptable for any community to be left behind by BusConnects. It must be about providing an excellent bus service for all who need it, including the elderly, people with disabilities and commuters.

In the Dáil and in councils across the state, Sinn Féin will continue to oppose the privatisation of bus routes and demand the very best of transport services for the public and owned by the public.

Council Strategic Policy Committees (SPCs) on Transportation are tasked with preparing and debating policy alternatives for transport and traffic. Sinn Féin councillors will ensure these SPCs reflect the views and needs of ordinary people when it comes to advocating reform of public transport.

Many people living in or around smaller towns have no or only limited bus services and are denied access to decent and affordable public transport. Sinn Féin propose additional bus services for small towns and their hinterlands to address their transport needs.

We need so much more than the Local Link service, important as that is for social inclusion to people who do not drive. We also need services that can act as a genuine alternative for greater numbers of daily commuters.

The SPCs on transportation should play an advisory and facilitation role supporting local communities to get the best out of the additional bus supports proposed.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Council SPCs on Transportation work pro-actively to ensure changes to public transport provision only ever enhance delivery and serve the needs of the people

More bus services for rural Ireland

BROADBAND

For small businesses in rural areas, talking about Brexit supports and ambitious growth plans means little if communities don’t even have access to quality broadband and local businesses can’t even process debit card payments.

It’s time for a new beginning in rural Ireland.

The National Broadband Plan has been mired in controversy and offers bad value for money for the taxpayer, with no guarantee of it ever being delivered. The Government’s plan to privatise broadband represents an historic transfer of public wealth to private hands that will deprive rural Ireland of crucial public services in the future.

Sinn Féin have called for the National Broadband Plan to be delivered through ESB, ensuring broadband infrastructure is delivered to homes, farms and businesses without delay, under public ownership and through a trusted and experienced public enterprise.

This would ensure that existing infrastructure could be leveraged to deliver high-speed broadband with greater public value and under greater democratic control. It means having broadband delivered through a trusted and experienced company with a track record of delivery. It means vital infrastructure being under public control to ensure future investment for future generations.

In addition, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund should partner with local authorities to invest in the creation of broadband hubs with work spaces for local businesses and to facilitate greater remote working.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Using ESB-owned infrastructure to roll-out broadband to rural Ireland

ISIF partner with local authorities to deliver broadband hubs and work spaces

EDUCATION

The education sector in the state is underfunded and disjointed. Educational attainment varies greatly from area to area, with various problems arising from the unique circumstances in those areas. Local communities know what the local issues are, whether it is lack of school places, lack of choice for parents, problems with school transport, lack of opportunities for further education or skills training. These local problems are best fixed with a properly informed local perspective. Local representatives therefore need a greater input in solving the problems identified by local parents, students and educators combined.

Sinn Féin want to see an integrated, cradle-to-grave approach to education, which ensures that everyone reaches their potential and guarantees everyone an equal opportunity to attain their educational goals. To this end, Sinn Féin want to see the strong use of the Strategic Policy Committees (SPCs) in local councils to have input into the education sector in their local authority areas. This should ensure that there is adequate engagement with appropriate local, regional and state-wide agencies and bodies to ensure that early years, primary, secondary, third level, apprenticeship and lifelong learning opportunities are realised for all our citizens.

Sinn Féin would see this as an important first step in a radical reorganisation of our education sector that is focused on delivery of education as a right for all.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Ensuring the coordination of education and training services are incorporated into the SPC schemes of all local authorities

That SPCs would prioritise ensuring there are adequate school transport facilities available for all those in need of transport, particularly those with additional needs or those who must travel lengthy distances in order to access education

That local representatives would be well placed to work with the Department of Education and Skills, the NCSE and parents to ensure appropriate and adequate provision of Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) classes and other special educational services in the locality according to the level of need

CHILDCARE

Sinn Féin believes that high-quality, affordable childcare must be readily accessible to all who wish to avail of it.

We do not believe any parent should have to pay the equivalent of a second mortgage for childcare.

In our Alternative Budget Sinn Féin demonstrated to the government that it is possible to halve the price of childcare for parents while increasing pay levels across the sector through increased public investment.

Investment in early years services not only benefits children educationally and socially, but it has benefits to society as a whole – including allowing skilled and experienced workers return to the workforce, and employing thousands of citizens in the sector. Studies have also showed that investment in Early Childhood Education and Care now has long-term economic returns down the road.

Sinn Féin believes the provision of childcare should be treated as a public service. We believe a model that is publically subsidised, of high quality and universally accessible is achievable if the sector is given the respect and funding it deserves. This includes fair wages for early years educators.

If operated in a progressive way, our childcare system can be a significant employer itself and facilitate further employment growth.

While local government does not have direct control over childcare at present, local councillors can ensure developers and planners include provision of childcare facilities as part of their planning permission. Sinn Féin has recently argued that provision for childcare facilities should be included in all future IDA Business Park developments.

Ensuring that childcare is available to all who need it is a common sense move that benefits local communities both socially and economically, and Sinn Féin councillors will stand with parents and providers to ensure these demands are met.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Rolling out affordable high-quality childcare for all those who wish to avail of it

Increasing public investment in order to halve the price of childcare for parents and increase pay for childcare workers

Ensuring continued support to the Community Childcare Subvention scheme which allows low-income families to avail of quality childcare at a reduced rate and keep community creches open

Supporting provision of core funding to all local community-based creches to ensure equal access for all who need it

HEALTHY COMMUNITIES

While councils themselves have little direct input to health services rolled out by the HSE, Sinn Féin councillors have played an important role in protecting local services and advocating for their expansion where needed. Sinn Féin representatives will continue to fight to ensure your local health services are fit for purpose, accessible and available.

PRIMARY CARE

Primary Care Centres were heralded as a one-stop shop for people’s basic health needs outside of a hospital and in the community. The centres should include a GP and other health professionals such as

nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and counsellors.

However, despite government announcements and fanfare one in five primary care centres have no GP and are lacking in other essential staff. This completely defeats the purpose of Primary Care Centres and transferring staff from other areas in the community to the centres will only further stretch already low staff in certain areas in our communities.

The provision of primary care centres, without the provision of the necessary services within them does not equate to primary care provision. Properly resourced primary and community care can and should play a huge role in delivering healthcare directly to people in their communities and also relieve the pressure on hospitals.

Improved access to GP and other services in the community is proven to deliver better diagnostics and early interventions for patients and it also reduces pressure on hospitals, particularly if there is an increased focus on preventative care in the community.

Strong and effective primary care is fundamental to overall health system performance, delivers improved public health and shifts more towards disease prevention and early intervention, alongside the traditional ‘diagnose and treat’ model.

This can only be done through effective primary care in the community.

A strong Sinn Féin team on your council will fight for the delivery of proper healthcare for our community. Providing free car parking zones for patients around hospitals Car parking charges are an additional burden on sick patients and their families. We need to take a brave step to deal with what is a serious concern. Sinn Féin support the removal of car parking charges at hospitals and will continue to fight for it on a state-wide level. We have seen in Wales how the NHS there abolished all car parking charges, and it offers a blueprint as to how it can be done here.

Car parking charges are an unfair expense on people frequently attending hospitals, whether they are patients, staff, or visitors. We need to work towards free parking so as to provide a fairer and more consistent approach to parking policy.

A strong Sinn Féin team on your Council will work with hospitals and stakeholder groups in order to

provide free parking for patients and their families in the vicinity of hospitals where they are able to do so.

THE ROLE OF SPORT IN PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE

Sport plays a huge role in our communities and for people right across the State. Unfortunately, for many sport and physical activity can be out of reach due to a lack of accessible facilities.

Sinn Féin believe we need to harness the benefits of sport and physical activity in order to help people improve their physical and mental health. We know that physical activity, including regular exercise and sporting activity, is the best way of staying physically and mentally fit. It helps to tackle weight and obesity issues, and plays an important part in preventing or reducing the impact of many other physical and mental healthrelated conditions.

Apart from the individual health benefits, there is evidence on the positive direct and indirect social benefits of participation in sport and physical activity.

However, research at a European level has shown that the proportion of those who say they never exercise or play sport has increased. Indeed, the figure in Ireland is 31%. Too many people across Ireland are not physically active enough, which in turn has a serious impact on physical and mental health generally, as well as the frequency of certain preventable diseases, and contributes to a number of premature deaths.

In order to make physical activity more accessible, we need to make sure sporting facilities are more generally available.

A strong Sinn Féin team on your council will fight for the delivery of proper sporting facilities for our community.

SINN FEIN PROPOSES:

Fighting for fully staffed primary care centres in your communities.

Working with hospitals and stakeholder groups in order to provide free parking for patients and their families in the vicinity of hospitals.

Fighting for the delivery of proper sporting facilities for our community.

MENTAL HEALTH

Despite much greater awareness of mental health issues among the general public, the services which many people depend on in their most vulnerable moments remain under staffed, underfunded and too hard to access.

The failure to deliver adequate services has had a devastating effect on countless people, their families and communities. Mental health is an essential ingredient in the development of a better society where everyone can achieve their potential.

Mental health care is a human right and must be free, accessible and effective in an Ireland which respects its people.

The local election represents an important opportunity to highlight what can and should be done at local level to improve people’s mental health and wellbeing.

Sinn Féin has been a driving force in putting mental health issues on the agenda at local and national level. We played an instrumental part in the development of Mental Health proposals under Sláintecare and in the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Health. In councils across the island we have fought for better services, against cuts and for new approaches to meet the needs of communities hit by mental health, suicide and addiction.

Sinn Féin will continue to work to develop effective local strategies to address mental health and suicide prevention by supporting community initiatives and demanding better from the HSE.

Sinn Féin recognise that gambling, drug and alcohol addictions are first and foremost public health issues. We support a holistic approach to prevention, rehabilitation and recovery.

Sinn Féin supports the development of wellbeing quarters, urban development in line with the cutting edge academic research on how our spaces impact our wellbeing. For example, landscaping, colours, lighting & noise, access to nature and environmentally friendly design have been all found to impact societal wellbeing. A wellbeing quarter aims to be an example of best practice in delivering on the findings of this research, in order to inspire more wellbeing strong community spaces.

SINN FEIN PROPOSES:

Demanding improved community-based mental health services locally for children and adults and the implementation of A Vision for Change, Sláintecare and the Future of Mental Health Report

Supporting and promoting community-led mental health initiatives

Protecting and expanding specialist mental health services for those in homelessness

Mental Health proofing all council budgets

Supporting development of Wellness Quarters in our towns and cities

Working with communities and services to develop Local Response Plans for all areas for suicide prevention and mental health promotion

Improving communities services and facilities which promote mental wellbeing such as mens’ sheds and youth cafes

Supporting the establishment of Jigsaw Youth Mental Health services in all localities appropriate

Putting a focus on the wider needs of those undergoing treatment for addiction including accommodation, education, vocational training, employment and childcare needs

EQUALITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER PEOPLE

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

There are over 650,000 persons with disabilities living in the south of Ireland according to census 2016. Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in March 2018. We now need its implementation and with it a rights based, inclusive and accessible society for everyone. Local authorities have a role to play in delivering this society. In local government Sinn Féin councillors will consider the abilities and different abilities of everyone when making decisions.

In local government Sinn Féin councillors will consider the extra cost of having a disability when making decisions. These costs are substantial and have been estimated to represent 35.4% of disposable household income. Addressing the extra economic costs of disability is a logical step towards alleviating elements of social exclusion for people with disability.

For people with disabilities money is not the only barrier to living a truly equal life, free from worry. Further barriers arise from the built environment and the design and style of services – private and public. By taking an All-of-Authority multi-departmental approach and disability proofing all of its own work local councils can promote greater inclusion and significantly improve the lives of their residents with disabilities.

In local government Sinn Féin will prioritise the development of inclusive and accessible communities. To achieve this, we will ensure that all plans are in line with the National Disability Strategy (NDSIP) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES THAT;

It is ensured that each local authority would promote and work towards disability proofing all of their work including annual budgets and ensure their areas are disability friendly and accessible. There should be a multidepartment and all of Authority approach to disability issues eg Transport / Environment / Finance etc in all local authorities

All local authorities would employ a Disability Liaison/Access and Equality Officer to whom disabled persons can contact and meet if they need specific access supports and to whom they can address any problems they encounter when accessing services

Persons with disabilities should be encouraged and accommodated to take up positions on decision making bodies at local level.

Independent living should be promoted at all times in line with government de-congregation policy and also to allow persons with disabilities to move on from their family home settings where sought.

We ensure all new builds social and private meet universal design standards. Engagement should happen also with Approved Housing Bodies to ensure provision of housing for people with disabilities.

In line with the National Housing Strategy for People with Disabilities, the Housing and Disability Steering Committees in every local authority should regularly update local government representatives on the work of their groups to oversee the drive to improve the provision of social housing to people with disabilities.

Every local authority maintain a register of all wheelchair accessible social housing in their area and occupancy status

All local authorities should ensure that at least 7% of all new social housing is fully wheelchair accessible housing, for the purposes of living, which would increase based on the approved housing list and the demand in the area.

All local authorities would develop a strategy to include and promote the use of Irish Sign Language in the authorities work where possible

We demand of central government adequate funding for all local authorities to meet need as demanded for Housing Adaptation Grants and to eliminate current waiting lists

All local authorities would employ Autism awareness training with staff and work towards developing local autism empowerment strategies

All local authorities would promote and support the employment of persons with disabilities and reach and ideally surpass the statutory targets in place. Disability experts should also be in place within Education Training Boards to assist students towards further education and/or employment.

OLDER PEOPLE

Urban and rural Ireland is a more isolated place for older people than it has been at any time in the past. Sinn Féin recognises the vital role of local authorities working with other agencies and stakeholders to promote inclusion for all people in society and especially the most marginalised including older people. Social participation for all older persons should be actively encouraged in all civic and local authority events. Sinn Féin proposes a number of measures which can be rolled out at Local Authority level to assist older people financially, socially and culturally.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES THAT WE;

Demand of central government adequate funding for all local authorities to meet need as demanded for Housing Adaptation Grants and to eliminate current waiting lists

Promote measures of inclusion for Older Persons to end social isolation and look at setting up an Older Person’s forum in all local authorities

Work with other agencies and stakeholders to hold annual awareness campaigns at local level to eliminate elder abuse

Engage other social care providers along with local authority to promote Independent living in all cases where possible

Provide user friendly information on all supports and services available from local authorities

Encourage social participation for all older persons in civic and local authority events

Engage with local dementia service providers to identify opportunities for collaboration, specifically with regards to accessing appropriate local facilities to extend the range of services available to people with dementia and their families

Provide opportunities at local council meetings for people impacted by dementia to share the issues and challenges they face and ways that the local authorities can support them to address these.

Create dementia inclusive communities by growing and developing the involvement of local authorities in the Dementia: Understand Together campaign

COMMUNITY SAFETY TACKLING CRIME

We have to work together to ensure our communities are welcoming safe places to live, work, study and visit. Unfortunately some of our communities have recently seen an increase in serious anti-social behavior and crime. It is essential that we tackle the causes and consequences of this.

However probation services, Gardaí, youth services and drug task forces have all seen their budgets slashed. This has had a hugely negative effect. It is unacceptable to expect services to tackle a growing problem with fewer resources.

Drug related intimidation is now a daily challenge for many people and their families. A recent report by City Wide Drug Crisis Campaign and the Health Research Board exposed the depth of the intimidation. 74% of those suffering intimidation did not report incidents to Gardaí. 37% of people experienced physical injury, 67% reported mental health problems as a result of the intimidation. But 90% reported incidents to community groups and family members.

Sinn Féin councillors have been to the fore in working with others to demand an end to cuts and increased investment in local services and standing with local communities in the face in intimidation from criminal and anti-social elements.

Structures that were put in place are no longer fit for purpose. There is little connection between Joint Policing Committees, Local Policing Forums and the very communities they were established to represent. Regional and Local Drug and Alcohol Task Forces have had their funding cut and Government agencies are noted by their absence. This must change. With the correct political leadership this can change.

We also need to ensure that those who continue to make life hell for their communities are adequately tackled and imprisoned when necessary. Too often people see serious criminals

with multiple convictions walking free from court with non-custodial or suspended sentences. This undermines confidence in the justice system and leads to a sense of helplessness in communities affected. Sinn Féin recently secured the inclusion of sentencing guidelines in legislation – a landmark in criminal justice reform - which will ensure more consistency and transparency in sentencing.

When farmers and tradespeople lose valuable tools and machinery to theft, it can impact on their ability to make a livelihood. Sinn Féin have introduced legislation to set up a Valuable Items Register that will ensure all such items are uniquely marked and can be tracked when criminals attempt to sell them on.

Rural Crime Task Forces should be formed in all Garda Divisions to ensure resources are adequately focused on the problems affecting those areas, relentlessly targeting the gangs and individuals that are widely known to be involved in crime and anti-social behaviour. Taking an approach that is community led, and adapts as required in consultation with local communities, adopting a more pro-active approach to policing in rural areas.

SINN FEIN PROPOSES:

Restore funding for youth services and drug task forces to 2008 levels as a first step to meeting the current funding deficit

Re-establish the Emerging Needs Fund & the Young Persons Facilities and Services Fund

Prioritise community-based Garda services

Mandate Government departments and state agencies to reengage with Drug Task Forces

Greater coordination between Joint Policing Committees, Local Policing Forums and local communities

Increase Garda numbers in areas of greatest need

Open more Garda stations in rural Ireland

Ensure sentencing guidelines are put in place without further delay

Introduce a valuable items register for tools and machinery to prevent their resale

Establish Rural Crime Task Forces in each Garda Division

AN GHAEILGE – THE IRISH LANGUAGE

Sinn Féin is committed to the promotion and use of the Irish Language in public and private life. We are committed to its protection in legislation and to the implementation of an Irish Language Act in the 6 counties.

Sinn Féin is also committed to using our political strength to ensure local government councils deliver services and protections to fulfil the rights of Irish speakers.

Local Authorities need to live up to their statutory responsibilities with regards the language eg council business should be possible through Irish, in planning - new estates should be named in Irish, the Council should lead out on Seachtain na Gaeilge.

Local councils should deliver Irish Language provision in a planned and strategic way; in cooperation and consultation with the Irish Language Community and Irish Language agencies.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

THE ARTS

Sinn Féin believe that designers, musicians, dancers, visual artists, web developers, emerging film makers and performers can and should be offered insulation from the commercial business rental market, and that such security of tenure can be provided through affordable, local authority owned cultural spaces, rented to creative tenants for short and long-term tenancies that ensure fairness in access.

Sinn Féin believes that creativity is an essential input into the emerging economy.

This is the start of a process that would see each Local Authority (31) appoint an artist in residence, for twelve-month periods each year, to work in a collaborative fashion with staff, in developing an active understanding and awareness of creative thinking and processes and to create work based on their observations and experiences within the public libraries, museums, theatres and community centres of the local authority. They should also have a role in increasing awareness of climate issues through their art to assist in raising public consciousness of one of the greatest challenges of our generation.

Local Authorities have a major responsibility in enabling and empowering work and activity in the culture, arts and heritage spheres.

All local authorities should have an Irish Language Officer and a Coiste na Gaeilge

Councils to promote Seachtain na Gaeilge

New estates to be named in Irish and tied to the culture, heritage or history of the locality

In 2018 the combined local authority arts programme spend was €67.2 million – almost on a par with the Arts Council’s investment. It is important to note that the distribution of this spend varies from council to council, from €1.89 per head of population at the low end to €75 per head of population at the high end. While this disparity reflects the resources and priorities of each local authority it also represents a potential democratic deficit: the right of access to cultural activities is not equal across the state.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Local authorities re-purpose and refurbish existing vacant buildings for use as state owned artist spaces

Each local authority appoint an artist in residence

Local authorities on the lower end of the ‘per head’ spend on culture seek to resolve this over the next five years

LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING

Sinn Féin is committed to the abolition of the Local Property Tax. The property tax is a totally unjust tax which will only increase and increase. We have, where possible, reduced the LPT by the maximum of 15% every year since 2014. We ensured this did not affect any public service or jobs being operated by local authorities.

In the past 5 years in Dublin City Council, Sinn Féin secured the maximum reduction of 15%. By contrast Longford County Council, the only council currently without a Sinn Féin councillor is the only council to have raised it by the maximum amount.

The government have frozen the tax at 2013 prices but this cannot go on forever and big increases are inevitable unless it’s scrapped. This would save 1.9 million homeowners an average of €278 per year.

A Sinn Féin led government would relieve families of the unfair Local Property Tax, while at the same time replacing funding to local councils to ensure that the funds they need to deliver for communities are not reduced.

Sinn Féin would press hard against land hoarders and those blockading the housing market to drive up prices by introducing a Vacant Property Tax, and increasing the Vacant Site Levy.

Local councils rely on business rates collection for a large portion of their annual funding, with which they provide local services and amenities.

However, small businesses often justifiably cite an inconsistency in both the level at which rates are levied, and in how they are collected. This creates a sense of unfairness and difficulty in planning for the time ahead.

Some estimates point to at least €220m in commercial rates which are not collected annually, depriving local councils and communities of essential funding. In fact, collection rates vary between councils within a range of 74% to 96%.

This is a missed opportunity. Local Councils are best placed to drive economic activity and support

for small and medium enterprises which are community based and provide essential local employment. Councils should be resourced and empowered to support these firms and local communities in regenerating ailing town centres and levelling the playing field with out-of-town retail parks and internet shopping providers.

By way of reform, Sinn Féin supports the centralisation of rates collection to ensure more consistent compliance. This could be carried out through designation of a lead council to administer, and by appointing existing staff members in all local councils as a point of reference. This will be aided by the creation of a database of ratepayers to further provide consistency of collection.

We would also empower councils to pursue targeted economic strategies in their areas by encouraging targeted rates rebates, which would allow councils to provide assistance to struggling high streets and town centres to bring vibrancy and activity back to small population centres.

Local Councils are often held back as a result of inconsistent or inadequate funding. The heart of Irish society lies in local communities, and Sinn Féin is committed to a plan of economic and cultural regeneration of our urban centres, small towns and rural communities. Local councils provide the best vehicle to do this.

Sinn Féin propose that local councils should have stability and certainty when it comes to state funding. Government should provide central funding on the basis of multi-annual budgets, instead of forcing Councils to ask for funding if and when they need it. This will provide more predictable and better quality council projects and services. Indeed if councils themselves were afforded the consistency and stability of multiannual budgets then this benefit could be passed on to SMEs by way of greater certainty on rates allowing them to plan ahead more effectively also.

Private Public Partnerships have proven to be a financial and social disaster. PPPs must never be relied upon as the means to provide homes or regeneration for local authorities. They have left communities in Dublin and Limerick decimated through the collapse of redevelopment plans. Sinn Féin believes the redevelopment plans in Limerick and Dublin need to be prioritised and completed.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Abolishing the local property tax and until such time as this happens, to reduce it to the lowest possible amount in annual council budgets

Root and branch review of the current local government funding model which is unfair and inefficient

Targeted rates rebates aimed at reviving activity in struggling areas

Government should provide local councils with stable and certain funding

Oppose the use of PPPs and joint ventures

Seek the power for local authorities to access independent sources of income for instance from the European Investment Bank for building programmes and regeneration projects

LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Since the financial crash, and the relentless austerity years that followed, many communities and town centres have been hollowed out. Family shops that have served their community for generations have been forced to close their doors, and town centres are a shadow of their vibrant and thriving past.

The Irish Strategic Investment Fund is used for investing in overseas and domestic opportunities. However, in recent years, overseas investments have been underperforming.

Sinn Féin believes in using the money of the Irish people to invest in the potential of communities across the state.

We propose that €1bn of the Irish people’s own sovereign investment fund should be put to use regenerating and reviving struggling town centres, and Sinn Féin propose to do this in a number of ways.

This will be delivered in partnership with local councils across the island to ensure communities have the biggest say in how the state should invest in their communities. The use of Town Centre Health Checks can determine how the economy in your community has changed in recent years, and what can be done to allow it to reach its potential.

Investment would be directed towards vacant business units, investing in small businesses (with a focus on those delivering environmental and social value), and setting up remote work centres to give more workers the option of remaining in their communities instead of needless and congesting commutes.

Sinn Féin recognise the critical role played by Local Enterprise Offices in driving economic development. We also see a significant opportunity to grow the co-operative sector in Ireland, which would provide both a counterbalance to the somewhat volatile multinational sector and give greater control of indigenous industries to local workers. Through legislation, Sinn Féin propose giving workers the right to request employee ownership during business succession. Any such initiatives should have access to the full range of supports in their local authority area.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

ISIF partner with local authorities to invest €1 billion regenerating town centres and creating work centres equipped with highspeed broadband to enable greater remote working

OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORMS

DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYORS

Sinn Féin supports the concept of directly elected Mayors – it has the potential to put more powers into local, electorally accountable hands.

We welcome the Plebiscites that are being held in Cork, Limerick and Waterford as a positive first step.

We are disappointed that the proposals announced by government for the role do not devolve any powers downwards from government departments or state agencies.

We are also disappointed that a plebiscite is not being held in the four Dublin local authorities in order to ascertain people’s views on whether they want to have directly elected mayors also.

There is no value in a purely symbolic office of Mayor. To be successful it is essential that it has the powers and resources to make a real difference. Key functions related to transport, major roads, waste management and tourism could be vested in the Mayor’s office. There could also be a strategic coordination function in partnership with other local authorities in areas including housing, planning and economic development.

Sinn Féin are opposed to the salary for the mayors that has been recommended by government. It is far too high.

MATERNITY LEAVE FOR COUNCILLORS

Sinn Féin believes that councillors need to be able to avail of maternity leave when in office. Under current legislation, a councillor who is absent from council meetings for more than 6 months is deemed to have forfeited their seat. This acts as a major barrier for many women who may otherwise seek election to local government, particularly young women.

There also needs to be provision made to ensure that adequate representation is provided for constituents of a councillor availing of maternity leave. This would require a form of cover to be provided by allowing for a temporary co-option or through allowing for proxy votes in council chambers and committees.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

The introduction of directly elected mayors pending the outcome of plebiscites

Extension of the D’hondt method of selecting mayors, SPCs and committees during the term to more councils

Decentralising power and restoring Town Councils

The achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and Equality Budgeting should be brought to the heart of the budgetary process. All budgetary decisions should be equitable, fair and just, protect the vulnerable, address structural inequalities and promote the well-being of this and future generations.

SOCIAL PROCUREMENT – ADDED SOCIAL VALUE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY EXPENDITURE

Procurement by local authorities has tremendous potential to lift local economies while providing socially and environmentally responsible employment in local communities.

Sinn Féin propose local wealth building strategies to bring this about. This involves local authorities working closely with the community and with small local businesses and others to maximise economic potential for the benefit of all.

In essence, this involves Local Authorities using their procurement and spending power to invest in, and secure contracts with, good local employers.

First local authorities must carry out an examination of how much investment and economic potential is leaking out of the community to the detriment of small businesses and local supply chains.

The next step requires forming a database of local employers and providers with a strong commitment to their community, to creating quality employment opportunities for people with disabilities, to decent and living wages and strong at-work protections, and to the local environment.

Local authorities should work with anchor institutions, such as government departments, universities, colleges and employers with a long-term presence in communities to create the database and an online portal for easy-to-use submissions for contract work.

Local authorities should strengthen the ability of these local businesses to bid successfully for contracts through the portal and by hosting events to learn how tendering processes can be made even more user-friendly. This can also be done through the use of Social Clauses. Whereby companies who are successful in getting large public contracts will employ local companies to provide local services, with preference given to those with Living Wage Employer Certificates that demonstrate the minimum wage they pay is the living wage.

The living wage, decent pay, trade union recognition, quality employment opportunities for people with disabilities and other social criteria should be included wherever possible in the core specifications of contracts that are put out to tender by local authorities.

In this way, Sinn Féin is committed to building economic strength and capacity, while securing quality jobs and decent wages, for people in their own local communities.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Councils develop local wealth building strategies to maximise the social value of their expenditure by encouraging the awarding of contracts to good local employers who prioritise decent pay, trade union recognition, quality employment opportunities for people with disabilities and environmental responsibility.

TRANSPARENT AND ETHICAL PLANNING

Planning affects many aspects of our lives. It effects where and how we live. It effects where we work, socialise and how we travel. There is a need for strong local input into the planning of roads, transport, infrastructure, homes and recreational amenities.

The Mahon Tribunal issued damning findings on corrupt payments for land rezoning and planning permissions in Dublin. Findings of corruption were made against councillors from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. A former Chair of Dublin County Council and an Assistant Dublin City and County Manager served time in prison. Judge Mahon concluded that planning corruption had become entrenched because no one was prepared to stop it. Unfortunately Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael colluded to prevent Sinn Féin attempts to introduce an office of an Independent Planning Regulator as recommended by Mahon.

Sinn Fein elected representatives will do whatever it takes to root out malpractice and corruption in planning once and for all – whether among elected representatives or council officials.

The inclusion of communities in the process of planning is critical to ensure successful outcomes. There should be independent checks at various stages of the City & County Development Plans process to ensure community involvement up to that point. Failure to achieve this independent accreditation should see the reversal of that stage of the plan’s development with that part of the process having to be undertaken again in order to achieve proper community involvement objectives.

Years of planning scandals and corruption have allowed the planning process to be brought into disrepute. However rather than reform the planning process and make it more accountable, consecutive governments have simply stripped powers away from elected councillors.

Recent changes to the planning system have not been positive. Strategic housing development changes now allow developments of 100 units or

more go straight to An Bord Pleanála, bypassing local scrutiny. It is the same for student bed spaces of 200 beds or more.

Fine Gael Minister Eoghan Murphy’s recent changes in terms of apartment guidelines, including heights, minimum size and car parking requirements have further eroded the local development plans.

The planning process must be accountable, democratic, open, equally accessible and transparent. Sinn Féin aims to create a more meaningful role for communities in planning and decision making processes and will push for primacy to given to the local area and county development plans.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSE:

Councillors take an ethics pledge linked to an Elected Representatives Code of Conduct

Exercising vigilance against malpractice and corruption in planning in every council area, rigorously pursuing any evidence of same, adequate sanctions against those found guilty of corruption, including prison sentences and advocating on behalf of Whistleblowers that may come forward to defend the public interest

Reversing the planning reforms on apartment sizes and strategic housing developments introduced by Alan Kelly, Simon Coveney and Eoghan Murphy

Making the Planning Regulator fully independent of the Minister and Department of Housing

Holding developers accountable by systematically imposing substantial, index-linked bonds refundable in the event of full compliance with planning conditions

Ensure meaningful community involvement in drawing up local development plans

Primacy for local area and county development plans

Maximising the potential of Public Participation Networks which Sinn Féin will encourage to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

RURAL AREAS NEED A BOOST AND A NEW BEGINNING

Communities in rural Ireland have experienced neglect and decline under successive governments, despite lip service to our rural base as a nation.

Investment, jobs and infrastructure have been focused on some of Ireland’s urban centres while services, jobs, infrastructure and communications are absent in rural areas and so, our young people have left.

Many small towns and villages have been hollowed out by the austerity imposed on them following the 2008 crash and are yet to recover. The post offices, the small shops and petrol stations remain closed, while the age profile grows older and those who receive their secondary education locally must travel for college and never come back. There are simply no jobs for graduates in rural areas.

There is no reason why young people should be forced to move to cities or abroad for decent work. There is no reason why half a million Irish homes should be forced to live without access to adequate broadband. There is no reason why Garda stations have been moved farther and farther away from your home, or that the public transport has been cut back to uselessness.

Sinn Féin recognises the place of Ireland’s rural communities in our society, and we propose a new beginning for rural life to end the neglect and forced isolation of increasingly vulnerable rural areas.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Setting up partnerships between local government bodies and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to invest around €1bn in the coming years in ailing town centres and directly into your local economy

ISIF partner with local authorities to deliver broadband hubs and work spaces to enable remote working and cut down on commutes

Using ESB-owned infrastructure to roll-out broadband to rural Ireland

Opening more Garda stations in rural areas, hiring more Gardaí and improving the technology and resources available to them

Channelling additional state services through post offices to ensure their future

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT – REBALANCING IRELAND’S ECONOMY

Huge sections of our island economy have not benefitted from a meaningful share of economic growth in recent years. In fact, the West of our island, the border region, and many parts of the South East are still struggling with the legacy of the bankers’ crash of 2008.

Foreign Direct Investment and the associated high-skilled, well-paid employment centres on Ireland’s big cities. This acts as a magnet for investment and talent from the rest of our island, depriving Ireland’s diverse regions and communities of much-needed investment. As a result, many domestic small businesses are in decline.

Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are foolishly expecting against all the evidence that foreign investment will begin to flood into the border corridor and the west of Ireland. But why would it, when they have refused to even provide broadband and basic infrastructure?

Fine Gael will point to Project Ireland 2040 as their strategy to address their own failed legacy of huge regional imbalance. But, like all Fine Gael plans, it is little more than a glossy PR stunt – lacking timeframed specifics, formed without any real input from communities across the island, and unsurprisingly neglecting the border and North West of our island in favour of Dublin.

Sinn Féin believes that the time for waiting and hoping that others do the job of the Irish government is over. It’s time to invest, to use our wealth to lift the fortunes of communities across the island, and rebalance our economy more towards deprived regions and domestic SMEs. This will provide high-quality employment rooted in communities, and in doing so will stabilise our public finances.

The people living and working in regions across Ireland know better than anyone else what is needed, and Sinn Féin will empower local communities to decide how their government should invest in their potential.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Setting up partnerships between your local Council and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to invest around €1bn in the coming years in ailing town centres and directly into your local economy

Creating a new and cutting edge government strategy for domestic SMEs, enhancing their role in the economy, preparing them for technological change, and providing them with equivalent support and focus to that provided to international investors for decades

BREXIT – DEFENDING IRELAND’S INTERESTS

Brexit poses a unique and historic threat to politics and prosperity on the island of Ireland.

For Sinn Féin, defending the interests of the Irish people is paramount, and protecting the Peace Process, the Good Friday Agreement, and the integration of our island community is non-negotiable.

For border communities, those who have had to endure the impact of partition for generations, they remain the most exposed to a reckless, crash-out Brexit imposed on them by a right wing Tory-DUP axis.

Ultimately, the solution to this real threat of economic decline and further division of communities on our island is an end to partition and a referendum on the reunification of Ireland.

If the British government and Brexiteers in London refuse to lift the threat of a Brexit the people of Ireland overwhelming oppose, and which the people of the north democratically rejected, then the only logical and appropriate solution is to allow the people of this island to determine their future – Ireland united and prosperous in the EU, or an Ireland further divided with the north linked to the sinking Brexit ship.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Creating a €2bn Brexit Stabilisation Fund to invest in ports and infrastructure, €1bn of which will come from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund in partnership with local councils to support SMEs and vulnerable sectors after Brexit

Investing in public services to protect living standards for Irish citizens and support SMEs

A UNITED IRELAND

Sinn Féin want to build a new, agreed and united Ireland based on justice, fairness and equality. In an Ireland of equals, Sinn Féin is committed to building a prosperous and inclusive society.

Across Ireland, the work of all Sinn Féin councillors will be guided by the drive toward Irish Unity.

Sinn Féin will promote cooperation across councils north and south through enhancing existing cross border agreements and arrangements and pushing for new ones.

Sinn Féin will press forward with the campaign for a Unity Referendum, lead and promote national and international conversations on Irish unity and begin the practical planning for the final reunification of our country. We will push councils to pass motions in support of unity and making adequate preparations at council level as well as nationally.

A partitioned economy has not served the people of Ireland well. Sinn Féin is committed to the development of an all-Ireland economy in which we will build upon existing cooperation and integration of services across the islands, in particular in the areas of health, education, transport, agriculture and tourism.

All-Ireland planning for health will produce better outcomes as services are shared and developed in an efficient manner. An all-Ireland education system will allow the sharing of resources and expertise across the island, strengthen research and development and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the allIreland economy. A united Ireland with a modern and efficient transport system will move people, goods and services across the island building political, economic and social capital among all citizens. An all-Ireland agricultural industry will reduce the obstacles and red tape of working within two separate jurisdictions. As a world-class tourist destination, a united Ireland will see all regions, north and south, reach their full potential by creating employment and economic opportunity.

Presidential voting rights for all citizens of Ireland will be high on the agenda for all Sinn Féin activists. Sinn Féin will continue to lobby the Irish government to hold a 2019 referendum on the extension of Presidential voting rights to citizens living in the north (and abroad), so that we grant a voice to all Irish citizens as we work together to influence and shape the character of a united Ireland.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSES:

Enhanced co-operation between local authorities North and South

Planning be undertaken at all levels for a united Ireland

Referendums be held on Irish Unity and in the interim to extend voting rights to Irish citizens in the North

Introduction

The work of City and County Councils is central to our lives. They plan our communities; they support our economy; they protect our environment. They cover everything from tree -planting to footpaths, from playgrounds to recycling centres, from safe school routes to litter enforcement. The work of Councils underpins the sustainability of our communities.

Every five years everyone on the electoral register in Ireland gets to vote on the local issues that are important to them. They get a chance to set Councils’ priorities and send people to our local Councils who will stand up for their interests and put their communities first. We promise to do just that.

As Social Democrats, our single biggest aim is to improve public services. It is public services that drive equality, promote sustainability, reduce costs for businesses and families, and provide a fair chance for everyone.

This Manifesto sets out how Social Democrats Councillors will approach Council services and projects over the next five years. It is written very much from the point of view of what Councils in Ireland actually do. Some of the areas that we are focusing on include:

Housing: We will prioritise housing. Councils must play a stronger role in ending the crisis in affordability and the scandal of family homelessness. But crucially Councils must also plan for all of the infrastructure that should go with new estates. We just don’t want to build new homes; we want to build sustainable communities.

Environment: We simply must prioritise our environment. One report after another warns us of the impending perils of climate collapse. We are living way beyond the means of our planet and in the process we are exacting irreversible damage to our biodiversity. Councils must play their part in addressing this global issue.

Youth: Our Councillors will also focus on our youth. Our youth were left behind in the recession, and community facilities and services have yet to catch up. We want to strengthen social infrastructure for all age levels but with a particular focus on young people.

People with Disabilities: People with disabilities should be at the heart of all decisions. Our Councillors will prioritise the needs of people with disabilities. Accessibility should be a given. Sadly, this is just not the case. We want to put a renewed emphasis on this issue. 

Doing the Basics Better: We want to focus on getting Councils to do the basics well. That means being pro-active, open and responsive to our communities, taking enforcement seriously, following through on plans.. There are fine examples all around the country of successful Council projects such as on Community Budgeting, recycling projects, regeneration or community engagement. Councils can learn from one another to provide much better services to the public. Our councillors will ensure that their Councils value honesty, integrity and transparency and set high standards for themselves and their work.

Setting high ambitions, doing things right and putting people first will ensure that our Councillors will lead in building sustainable communities across the country.

Building Sustainable Communities

Ireland has been let down by its planning system. So many of our problems the high cost of housing, the traffic choking our towns and cities, our lack of basic amenities - can be attributed to the lack of sound long-term planning.

We need to learn from the mistakes of the past.

Planning is the one area that Councillors have a real say. Social Democrats Councillors will not waste this opportunity.

Planning can make a huge contribution to community development and placeshaping. Social Democrats don’t want to build just homes – we want to build communities. That means making amenities, infrastructure, transport services, schools, retail, accessibility, and environmental sustainability central to every single development that the Council sanctions.

Our priorities on planning are:

Build infrastructure, transport links and public services from the start

Our over-riding priority in planning is that Councils build in infrastructure, transport links and public services into every plan for our communities.

No homes should be built without a credible plan for the array of supports and infrastructure that communities need to thrive. We will ensure that public transport links, cycling, playing pitches, retail and recreation facilities form a central part of all Local Area Plans, Strategic Development Zones (SDZs) and local Master-Plans for all new developments

We will invest heavily in Local Area Plans and site Master Plans so that development is properly planned and is no longer developer-led.

We will ensure that our communities are aware and have a say in every significant rezoning proposal affecting their area.

We will put a very strong emphasis on streamlining the taking in charge process (see later section on this). Too many new communities have been forgotten by their Local Authority in recent years or have been let down by developers from whom they have purchased their homes.

Development Levies must mean Community Gain

We will seek to ensure that there is substantial community gain from development levies and that levies are clearly spent on improving social, community and physical infrastructure in the areas in which they are collected.

We will ensure that development levy schemes capture the existing needs and new needs of local authorities. Too many local authorities do not make enough provision for libraries, playgrounds, swimming pools, and other community facilities as part of their development levy scheme.

Open Planning & Enforcement

We will ensure that there is on-line access to all planning documentation in all local authorities, including the minutes of all pre-planning meetings.

We will ensure that the planning enforcement and derelict sites functions of our local authorities are active and responsive to complaints from the public and that there is proper follow through.

A Sustainable Future for All

We will ensure that the UN Sustainable Development Goals form a core part of and constitute the driving force behind our Local Authorities’ County Development Plan.

Public Land for Public Gain

We will seek to use public land for public gain, particularly in relation to housing, transport and recreation.

We will seek to significantly expand the Council’s land-holding, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency. Assembling public land banks is one of the key tools to addressing Ireland chronic housing problems and will be a key focus of our Councillors.

Promote Local Heritage

We will ensure that our Councils fulfil their responsibilities in relation to protecting and promoting the heritage of their area.

Building New Homes – Solving the Crisis

Ireland is in the middle of its second housing crisis in just a decade. Homelessness is at record levels. If we want to tackle the current crisis and prevent more, then we have to radically change our approach.

The Government is heavily relying on the private sector to deliver the extra homes we need. This hasn’t worked. And even if the private sector supplies more homes, they will be at the highest possible price they can sell or rent for. Under the current system, housing supply and housing affordability do not go hand in hand.

We need to change our housing system around so that the clear aim is to deliver housing at the lowest possible cost to purchasers and renters rather than the highest possible profit to developers and land speculators. To do this, we need to stop approaching housing and land like they are commodities, and start building homes using the extensive resources of the State. Local Authorities have a crucial role to play in this, especially in building on public land that is at their disposal and working with other Government agencies to plan and deliver new homes.

The over-reliance on Housing Assistance Payment works for no-one bar major landlords. It leads to greater demand for housing, inflating prices for those looking to rent privately. The Social Democrats believes that the best way to move away from HAP is the provision of public housing.

Social Democrats Councillors will make housing a clear priority in their local authority. Our clear overall objective is to tackle the housing shortage and homelessness crisis by ensuring homes are built and are made available at affordable prices to rent or buy.

Here are some of the measures we are committed to:

Build affordable homes

We will use the extensive residentially zoned public land that is available to public authorities to build homes that are affordable to rent or buy. We want to move away from a reliance on the

Housing Assistance Payment and expand the role of cost-rental, and we are keen to explore how the “Vienna model” could be applied in Ireland. As we set out in our Alternative Budget for 2019, we believe funding from the Rainy Day Fund should be provided to support the provision of Housing.

We are anxious that the O’Cualann housing model - which has very successfully delivered housing at low cost in Poppintree in Dublin - is rolled out across more Local Authorities. It is a prime example of how local Councils can facilitate and promote affordable housing.

We will reactivate the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme in each Council area

We will build the new affordable housing scheme into every Council housing or development plan and get it up and running in each Council area as quickly as possible.

Ensure Public Consultation

We will ensure that every significant Council housing proposal is subject to public consultation, has a proper master plan, has a good social and tenure mix, and that amenities and services are central to all significant plans.

Promote Voluntary Step-down Housing

We will promote the reintroduction of a voluntary step-down housing scheme for older people as previously existed in North–West Dublin and for which there is a considerable waiting list.

Tackle Family Homelessness

We will absolutely prioritise resolutions to the scandal of family homelessness.

We will insist that our Councils agree new homeless procedures so that children’s rights are included, and respected in how Council officials deal with homeless families. Children are not adequately considered as part of current Local Authority procedures contrary to Ireland’s obligation under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Develop Youth Homelessness Strategy

We will further insist on the development of a youth homelessness strategy for each Council that we are represented on.

Partner with Housing Associations

We will work closely with the Housing Association sector to deliver more units and to ensure the Housing First programme is fulfilled.

We will expand choice-based lettings to the sector and seek to develop opportunities for EU investment in housing delivery.

Address Vacant Housing

We will ensure that every local authority with a significant housing shortage has at least one full-time Vacant Housing officer and that the remit of the officers extends beyond the current two years.

We will use this service to bring hundreds of vacant units back into use, with a particular emphasis on publicly owned buildings. We are particularly keen to address “over-the-shop” vacant units.

We will seek to use compulsory purchase orders where appropriate, and nationally we favour the introduction of compulsory letting orders and a vacant unit tax.

End preferential tax treatment of REITS

We are very concerned about the impact of bulk property purchases by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) on the planning, availability and, ultimately, the price of housing. Under current arrangements REITs enjoy sizeable tax benefits and are using this position to purchase units in bulk.

New estates that were granted planning permission on the understanding that they were to be a mix of owner-occupied units and tenancies are now being settled as tenant only – this prevents planning for good tenure mix, which should be a strong consideration of every local plan.

In addition, first-time buyers are deprived of an opportunity to bid for homes in their area, and the whole process drives up the cost of housing and ensures only supply at the most expensive end of the market is delivered.

The Social Democrats commit to ending the preferential tax treatment of REITs and use the savings from this initiative to provide increased funding to Local Authorities.

Our Councillors and TDs will also endeavour to bring about a change in planning practice so that bulk purchases are prevented by local authorities if they run contrary to the desired tenure mix.

Radically Improve Rights for Renters

We will continue to campaign strongly for improved rights for renters, including a rent freeze in every county in Ireland. Our Bill to reduce the risk of homelessness by extending notice-to-quit periods for renters has been accepted by Government and now forms part of a Government Bill in this area. We will continue to be a voice for renters and to act on our rental charter wherever and whenever we have the opportunity.

Spend funds on Traveller Housing
We will seek to ensure that funding allocated for Traveller housing is spent by Local Authorities.

Reduce Voids
We will work with Councils to significantly improve the number of days “voids” remain vacant.

Improve Maintenance
We will act on behalf of Council tenants so that there are good response times to maintenance issues in local authority housing stock. We will support technological solutions for housing maintenance which will ensure more efficient responses.

Invest in Planning
We will invest heavily in planning so that the public are properly consulted and know what is being built in their communities. This will also ensure that construction costs are minimised as there is less planning risk involved.

Use Brownfield Sites
We will ensure that each Local Authority we are represented on works constructively with the Land Development Agency so that vacant and brownfield sites that are suitable for residential development can be brought into use quickly.

We will invest in Suburban Renewal by utilising unused or under-used brownfield sites across our urban areas.

Enforce Vacant Sites Levy
We will ensure that our Councils properly engage with the legislation governing the Vacant Sites levy and register, and enforce all relevant sites on their lists. We favour new legislation in this area such as our own Bill to eliminate loop-holes and ensure that the levy is workable and prevents land-hoarding and dereliction.

We favour the introduction of a public interest test and approval process at the point of significant land transfers to prevent over-concentration of land ownership.

Review Social Housing Income Limits
We will review income limits applied to social housing so that more people can qualify.

Remove Constitutional Barriers
We will continue to campaign for fundamental Constitutional change so that housing rights are made far more explicit in our Constitution.

Rezoning Industrial Lands
We are open to the idea in principle of rezoning lands that were formerly zoned for industrial use – however, we will approach this issue on a case by case basis. We also feel that the correct strategy is for Councils to acquire land before rezoning so that its value is captured by the State and not used to drive up the cost of purchasing it.

For further details of our priorities in Housing please see our Alternative Budget for 2019.

Community Budgeting – Giving People a Real Say

Community Budgeting is the Social Democrats’ proposal for the introduction of participatory budgeting schemes in all local authorities.

Building on international practice and the award-winning scheme run in South Dublin County Council since 2016, these schemes will bring control of some Council funds back to local communities with an opportunity for broad public participation in deciding spending priorities.

Community Budgeting will allow local residents and groups to propose ideas for Council spending in their communities using a specially-allocated fund. Proposed projects which meet scheme guidelines will then be shortlisted for public vote. Project proposals will take place both offline (workshops, public meetings, etc) and online. Similarly, voting will be facilitated both on- and offline.

Establishing Community Budgeting Schemes

Elected Social Democrat candidates will seek the establishment of Community Budgeting schemes in each local authority. They will seek the creation of cross-party Steering Committees with the involvement of both management and Councillors. Social Democrats Councillors will also seek to identify funding in the Council Budget process to allocate to a Community Budgeting Scheme.

The amount to be allocated and the geographic area covered (local electoral area/municipal district/full Council) will depend on the Council circumstances which apply. An exemplar is the successful €300,000 annual scheme in South Dublin County Council, which has seen projects as diverse as playgrounds, ball skill walls, apple tree orchards and public pianos proposed and voted for by the public and delivered by the local Council. Everyone locally will get a vote on how this fund is spent, including children.

Creating a Community Budgeting Fund

Nationally, the Social Democrats will seek the creation of a Community Budgeting Fund for local authorities to support these schemes. This could draw on dormant accounts funding and national lottery funding.

Community Budgeting can help promote public participation and enhance democracy at the lowest levels. Similar schemes have been highly successful since the first such one in Brazil more than 30 years ago, with hundreds of city and local authorities carrying this out in countries such as the US, Spain and Scotland.

Community Budgeting can also involve those traditionally on the outside of political structures, such as migrants, schoolchildren, disabled people and other marginalised groups. Councillors and Council management play an important role in establishing and steering the scheme, but guidelines will be put in place to ensure they do not back particular projects and instead ensure the public have their say.

Investing in Play, Sport and Recreation

Social Democrats Councillors are committed to prioritising play, sport and recreation opportunities for all age levels.

Our priorities are:

Provide Playgrounds

Our Councillors will prioritise the provision of playgrounds and we are particularly anxious to provide side by side play opportunities for people with disabilities. Our Councillors have already delivered a successful model in Greystones. Co. Wicklow that could be replicated.

Playgrounds should be seen as not only an investment in children but as a great way to bring communities together, foster social interaction and provide a focal point for parents and grand-parents. We want to see greater provision of playgrounds across the country but particularly in counties with high population growth over the past few years.

We are conscious that the positioning of playgrounds in local communities is an important factor for consideration in order to promote community buy-in, to reduce the risk of vandalism and to minimise anti-social activity. Public consultation will be a vital part of every playground proposal.

Invest in Youth Facilities

Having some down time is vital to our health. But where do teenagers go for this? Our young people spend more and more time in school or online. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to physical and mental health problems. They are often lonely and isolated – and may feel overwhelmed by the real life and virtual worlds that they occupy at the same time.

One of the biggest priorities of Social Democrats candidates is the provision of additional community facilities for young people.

With cut-backs in recent years, there has not been enough investment in facilities and services for young people.

Nonetheless, some Councils have shown that even with limited resources and by engaging in a genuine partnership with the community, they can play a key part in helping their local communities provide for this age group.

Social Democrats Councillors are committed to maximising Council resources in terms of empty or underused buildings, community/sports support workers, Council facilities etc. to improve youth services and in particular to offer alternatives to young people who don’t engage in mainstream sports and activities.

For the sake of our young people’s health and well-being they deserve places to be themselves, act like teenagers, entertain themselves and enjoy their limited free time.

Renew Focus on Community Facilities and Shared Spaces

Ireland has poor social infrastructure and were it not for the tremendous success of voluntary organisations such as the GAA and others, we would have very little indeed.

There needs to be a renewed focus on bringing our communities together and investing in shared spaces.

The Social Democrats want to set a general target of a community centre in every significant population base in Ireland. This can be made available to young and old alike and funded by an enhanced Sports Capital Programme and the two Regeneration Funds earmarked under the National Development Plan.

We can also do so much better with the community facilities we already have or those that are in planning. The model developed in Fingal Co. Council, known as the “Fingal Schools model”, is a very good example whereby it was agreed to colocate new schools with community facilities on sites made available by the Council. We would like to see this model replicated in other areas.

We believe all schools should be made available for after-hours community use where this is feasible from a security and residential amenity point of view.

Better Sports Facilities

We should be seeking through the Sports Capital Grants Programme to provide an open access MUGA pitch in every community (multi use games area) where that is feasible. These have worked very well in several communities where an appropriate location was identified and where strong community support was forthcoming.

Social Democrats Councillors will play an active part in maximising the funding of community facilities, such as swimming pools, skate parks etc through the Sports Capital Programme and we are committing that if in Government we will maintain a funding programme on an annual basis.

We want to expand the number of parks with strip lighting so that joggers can use parks safely after dark.

The Social Democrats also wish to maximise playing time for local sports clubs on Council pitches. The upkeep of some Council facilities leaves a lot to be desired. Poor drainage, irregular mowing, poor maintenance, or indeed closing down pitches/facilities at certain times of the year all impact on how active our children, young people and adults can be. This is unacceptable. It breaks very positive routines and is a factor in children dropping out of sport. We will seek to end the practice of Councils shutting down playing pitches during the year (other than for genuine reasons of maintenance or pitch recovery).

Promote Active lives

The emergence in recent years in certain Council areas of mid-night leagues, passports for leisure, and the Park Run phenomenon shows that Councils can play a huge role in keeping people active – and at relatively low marginal costs. We will seek to expand these across the country.

We will also seek to improve access to and expand the number of public allotments and community gardens.

We believe the Council can also play a strong role in supporting local Arts groups and we will look to support such groups in our communities.

Social Democrats Councillors will ensure that there is a play and activities plan for every age category in every local authority in which we are represented. We will place an absolute focus on driving up participation in sports and activities for all age groups. We are particularly keen on driving up and maintaining high participation rates in sports for girls.

Support Festivals & Culture Events

There are some fantastic examples around the country where Councils have partnered with local communities to deliver superb local festivals, cultural and heritage events. These events promote a strong sense of place and civic pride in our communities, and drive tourism and economic activity.

Social Democrats Councillors are keen to promote such activities in our Councils and we will use the resources of our Council as a key enabler for further events. We are also keen to address the escalating insurance costs faced by such events.

Put Strong Focus on Libraries

One of the success stories of Irish Local Government has been our libraries. The Social Democrats value the role libraries play and see them as a key tool in promoting adult literacy, life-long learning and community engagement. We want to put libraries as the focal point in our communities. We welcome recent improvements in relation to library fines and support the national strategy, Our Public Libraries 2022. We will ensure that Councils retain a strong focus on libraries and we will seek to expand the number of libraries and range of library services wherever possible.

Putting People with Disabilities at the Heart of all Decisions

Social Democrats Councillors are fully committed to ensuring that people with disabilities are a priority in the Councils in which we serve.

As a Party, we have signed up to the Disability Federation of Ireland’s campaign, #DisabilityVotesCount. We are promising that each of our elected Councillors will campaign on much better access for people with disabilities, ensure their voice is heard in all Council decisions, and ensure a plan is in place for each local authority by 2020 for people with disabilities.

The calls by the Disability Federation of Ireland are fully supported by the Social Democrats and include the following:

Accessibility – Make all local public services open and accessible for people who have a disability.

Participation – Ensure the participation of people with disabilities on local decision-making structures.

Planning – Make sure local authorities publish an implementation plan for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by 2020.

On a practical level, a Council which adopts these calls will be focusing on issues such as ensuring there is enough housing and parking for people with disabilities, accessible playgrounds, dishing pavements, designing streetscapes so that people with disabilities are not hindered by parked cars, bins, street lights and sign posts, and a thousand other ways to make it easier for people with disabilities to fully participate in their local community.

The Social Democrats believe clear commitments to people with disabilities should be embedded in council strategies and plans, including County Development Plans, and where we have Councillors elected we will lead the charge on this.

We are also making the following specific commitments:

Ensure that local authority offices meet universal design requirements.

Promote Make Way Day in each Council area.

Implement the National Disability Authority ‘Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information provided by Public Bodies’ and the NDA Accessibility Toolkit.

Set a minimum of 7% of social housing to meet universal design standards, and ensure that every social housing pipeline project demonstrates at Capital Appraisal Stage the inclusion of a minimum 7 % of fully wheelchair accessible housing with higher percentages applying for areas of higher need.

Promote the uptake of adaptation and mobility aids grants to enable independent living for persons with disabilities – too many Councils don’t spend their full allocation.

Ensure that local transport vehicles comply with universal design.

Promote the expansion of accessible taxi vehicles.

Ensure that the infrastructure for public bus, taxi and rail stops are well maintained and are accessible for people with disabilities.

Expand the number of playgrounds, pools, gyms, parks and green spaces and venues that are universally designed. In particular, we want to ensure that all future Council recreational projects include accessible changing facilities accessible toilets which include a hoist, adult sized changing bench and larger space for additional assistants, to ensure the health, safety and dignity of those with disabilities and mobility issues.

Encourage local businesses to universally design their premises and services, and in particular, improve access to local neighbourhood shops.

Ensure that people with disabilities are consulted on every Council decision that materially affects them.

Ensure that each Local Authority meets national targets to incrementally increase to at least 6% by 2024 the number of people with disabilities that are employed by the Council. Latest figures suggest some Councils are doing well on this already but some have a considerable way to go.

Ensure Local Authorities review their approved social housing lists and identify the number of people and households who require wheelchair accessible housing, and maintain a register of all wheelchair accessible social housing in their area and occupancy status.

Tackling Climate Change to build Cleaner Greener Communities

Climate Change is the single biggest threat to our environment, to our living standards, to our existence.

The Social Democrats recognise this threat as a fundamental issue facing our country and our planet. Everybody has to play their part in tackling it and preparing for its consequences. We won’t be found wanting.

Climate Change is a global issue that can only be tackled by every part of Government doing its bit.

Nationally, we will continue to advocate for increased support for the development of off-shore wind and other blue energy, electric cars, flood defences, a fair level of carbon tax that penalises polluters but doesn’t push people into poverty, and a new grants scheme for insulating homes that is available to everyone.

Councils must play their part also. Throughout this document we have placed a very strong emphasis on practical environment-friendly policies and actions that our Councillors will take if elected.

In our Councils,

We will drive strong long-term planning and sustainable communities;

We will support cycling and public transport;

We will promote biodiversity, recycling, and strong anti-dumping measures;

We will encourage new energy solutions and put Councils at the heart of delivering them.

We see the new Climate Change Adaptation Strategies that are currently being adopted by Councils around the country as a key part in ensuring there is a workable and actionable plan in place to tackle climate change locally, and we will deliver on these plans. Such strategies are particularly important in respect of coastal erosion, flood defence and extreme weather event planning.

As Councillors, there are hundreds of ways that we can make an impact on climate change.

Some practical measures we are proposing include:

Councils leading by example in housing design and energy saving in its own buildings

Designated drop off points around our urban centres within 1 km radius of schools so students walk on dry mornings

Cycling Buses for children travelling to school

Promote the use of surplus heat in district energy schemes Promote public awareness events on climate change, energy conservation etc Reduce the energy consumption of public lighting Promote and expand number of community gardens and allotments where feasible

Public recycling bins

Better collection opportunity at amenity centres for mattresses, sofas, large plastic toys etc

An end to single-use plastic at council events and time-lines to end or reduce them in council supported events

Bicycle shelters & secure lock-ups at all public buildings Wild flower gardens Water fountains Awards for the most environmentally friendly and most-environmentally improved multiple in your area

Car-charging points in every small town and village

Car-pool initiatives Tree-planting initiatives

Please see the following sections on Transport, Cycling, Litter and Dumping, Recycling and Waste, Plastics, Biodiversity and Energy Communities for further details of actions we are proposing.

Promoting Public Transport

Traffic is choking our cities, towns and villages. Meanwhile, too many Irish communities have no option but the motor car. Ireland has one of the highest rates of car usage in the whole of Europe at 84%.

This didn’t happen by accident. It has been borne out of a longstanding neglect of public transport investment. Under successive Irish Governments, one abandoned or delayed public transport plan has followed another. Our inability as a country to adopt long-term plans and implement them comes back to haunt us again and again.

The Social Democrats are committed to significant investment in both urban and rural public transport.

We believe that the National Development Plan was a missed opportunity with too little provided to this sector. We believe the National Development Plan should be redrawn so that public transport and cycling are re-prioritised over roads expenditure. This simply has to happen in order to reduce carbon emissions from the sector and to be able to plan for additional housing and sustainable communities.

In this Manifesto we are setting out a clear commitment that Social Democrats Councillors will campaign strongly on behalf of their communities for significant improvements in local Public Transport. We will use every power available to local Councillors to facilitate the expansion of public transport services in our communities.

Here are some of our solutions:

We are campaigning in favour of directly-elected mayors for Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford and we strongly believe that these mayors should assume responsibility for transport planning in each of these cities and counties with strong linkages with satellite counties.

We will put transport planning at the heart of all significant housing plans.

We must end the practice of building homes before we build the infrastructure that new communities will depend on.

We will ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are heard and responded to and that universal accessibility is put centrally in all transport decisions affecting our Council areas.

We will continue to campaign for lower fares so that the use of public transport is encouraged and congestion reduced.

We would like to see no/low fare public transport piloted in Ireland.

We will work with local public transport service providers to promote the use of predictive analytics to determine if extra service provision is needed during adverse weather conditions and major public events (Festivals, Concerts and Sports).

We will seek to ensure that Council officials are responsive to local traffic concerns and that requests for roads repairs, traffic lights, pedestrian lights, filter lights, yellow boxes, bollards, ramps and all aspects of traffic management and roads maintenance are dealt with promptly and efficiently.

We will invest heavily in cycling (see below).

We will promote active travel to schools and ensure that every Local Authority prioritises the provision of safe walking and cycling paths around every school in the country, so that those children who choose to walk, scoot or cycle to school, can do so safely.

We will seek to replicate Dublin’s Canal Cordon survey in all Cities and large towns so that Councils have reliable data to work on.

We will ensure that public transport service providers play a full role in Council Transport policy meetings and we will seek to establish good accountability arrangements at these meetings so that Councillors can raise service issues for constituents. We will further ensure that the National Transport Authority is more responsive to meeting requests from Local Authorities.

We will ensure that the public know about every significant transport and traffic proposal relating to their community and that their voice is heard in the decision-making process.

Getting Ireland On Its Bike!

Ireland is far behind much of Europe in terms of cycling policy. We need to recognise that cycling is a major transport area that can contribute hugely to society.

The benefits of cycling are enormous. And cyclist or not, everyone gains from them.

With more cycling we get less pollution, less congestion, less carbon emissions.

With more cycling we get healthier lifestyles and a more active population.  With more cycling we get better mobility and quicker commuting times.  With more cycling we get safer streets and more liveable neighbourhoods Cycling saves time, saves money, and saves lives.

We have produced Safer Cycling for Healthier Communities, our 12 point plan for cycling. It sets out clear commitments to cycling including:

Significantly improved Funding for Cycling

Proper Segregation for Safe Cycling and Improved Infrastructure

More Cycling Greenways and Urban Bike Schemes

Safer Cycling to School

Better Enforcement

Improved Cycling Tax Schemes

Cycling Officers & Training 

Our local Councillors will help put cycling at the heart of the thinking and strategy of each local authority we are represented in. Cycling should be recognised as a core element of transport policy and Social Democrats Councillors will make this happen.

Tackling Litter and Illegal Dumping

We believe our Councils can play a much bigger role in tackling litter and illegal dumping. As judged by the number of fines issued, there is significant variance in the level of enforcement activity by local Councils. And even allowing for population differences, counties such as Offaly, Leitrim, Kilkenny and Kerry are consistently towards the bottom of the list.

Similarly, the level of funding per capita for Local Authorities under the Local Authority Enforcement Measures Scheme varies widely with significantly lower levels in counties such as South Dublin, Galway County, Galway City, Kerry, Kildare and Fingal.

As with general financing of Local Authorities, the Social Democrats believe there needs to be an evidence-based approach to the funding Local Authorities receive to tackle dumping. For instance, why does Longford Co. Council get six times more funding per capita under this scheme than Galway Co. Council?

The Social Democrats will ensure that every Local Authority adopts a clear strategy on dumping, and takes a no-nonsense approach to offenders.

In general, our Councillors will take the following approach:

The Social Democrats favour a naming and shaming policy for people found guilty of illegal dumping. Our Councillors will explore all legal avenues to bring this in. We will seek to deploy technology wherever feasible to catch culprits.

We will seek to reverse the trend of Councils removing public bins. We are particularly anxious that bins are provided in areas such as bus-stops and taxi ranks, on approaches to schools, outside neighbourhood shops, ATMs etc.

We will promote the expansion of Council furniture/junk collection days as resources allow.

We will promote and support residents’ clean-up days and work side by side with Tidy Towns committees to deliver cleaner environments in our communities.

Public facilities for disposal of non-recyclable material should have longer weekend and evening opening hours. The easier it is to dispose of unwanted goods the less likely there will be a problem with dumping.

Charges for bringing disposable items to public facilities should be as uniform as possible across the country and should be pitched at a level that discourages dumping.

We favour doubling the on-the-spot fines for littering and further increasing fines for illegal dumping.

In turn, we want to double funding to the anti-dumping initiative so that detection, enforcement and clean-ups can be improved.

It is vital that penalties for illegal dumping are actually applied. Enforcement bodies are too often failing in their duties to apply appropriate penalties. Our Councillors will work to ensure that fines are applied at a level that reflects the risk posed to or damage exacted on the environment.

An estimated 50,000 households dispose of their waste in an unregulated manner according to the County and City Management Association. We will focus Councils’ attention on reducing this figure.

We want to set strict enforcement targets for local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency to deal with the chronic problem of illegal dumping and infringements of conditions attached to waste licences and permits and we would improve national funding to allow the recruitment of additional staff in this area.

Investing in Recycling

People want to do their best for their environment and play their part by recycling as much as possible. However, we are not making it easy for them.

Our current recycling system is a complete mess. There isn’t enough basic information for consumers on how and where you can recycle material, and the recycling system in Ireland can’t handle lots of goods that are sold in our shops.

We urgently need national legislation on banning certain single use plastics and micro-plastics, and a new national and EU strategy to tackle unrecyclable packaging. Local Authorities and therefore local Councillors have a key role to play in this.

The Social Democrats want our Councils to start taking the lead again on recycling. Some of them have very committed staff doing a great job in their area but many could do so much better.

The three key points are that consumers must have much better information so that they can make informed choices on minimising their waste and maximising their recycling, reuse, and repair opportunities

we need a completely new waste process that is much more effective in minimising waste, so that the amount of unrecyclable products reaching our supermarket shelves is vastly reduced and so that recyclable waste that is currently not collected as part of household collection services can be recycled.

Local Authorities can play a much bigger role by expanding the number of Civic Amenity Centres, making waste charges affordable, expanding opening hours of bring centres, and providing better options for recyclable material that is currently not part of kerbside collection.

We are proposing a mixture of practical local and national measures to vastly improve the effectiveness of Councils’ work on recycling and promoting the circular economy:

Better Recycling/Repair Options

We believe that funding for the development of recycling centres should be reinstated and the number expanded so that there is at least one civic amenity centre close to the population it is meant to be serving. We believe the general target should be to have one in every Dáil constituency at a minimum. Currently there is no civic amenity centre in Co. Longford and only one serving Cork City, one for Galway City and only two covering the City Council part of Dublin.

We will seek to spread best practice around the country. The recycling centre in Bray, Co. Wicklow is a very good example where the public service has partnered with charity shops to allow residents dispose of certain unwanted material.

We would like to end the practice of waste collected in public bins going to landfill and we will seek to roll-out segregated public waste bins.

The Social Democrats wish to support the creation of more social enterprises such as the Rediscovery Centre, Food Cloud, and Recreate Ireland . We will ask the Government and Councils to examine how the tax code or a preferential commercial rates policy could help promote better second-hand markets and repair businesses.

We will explore through the European Institutions the possibility of reduced VAT rates for the repair of goods and how better regulation could ensure goods are longer lasting and repairable.

We will promote local repair options for consumers – such as for mobile phones and other electronic devices.

Improved Information and Education for Consumers

We need far better customer information on recycling – what can be recycled, where and what bin can it go in. While the development of www.mywaste.ie has been welcome, it is far too basic. If waste can’t go in a household recycling or compost bin, then consumers should know where in their area an item can be recycled. Such information is not readily available in many local authorities.

And if it’s sold here with a recyclable label on it, then it should be actually recyclable here. There is also much confusion among the public as to what the different recycling emblems on packaging mean. Our Councils can play a much stronger role in such basic information.

We believe education on recycling, reducing and re-using can also be improved in our schools - building on the success of the Green Flag initiative.

New Recycling Targets

We want to see new targets established for the percentage of domestic households and businesses that have recycling bin and compost bin services, with a particular focus on apartments and rural areas.

At the last count, the percentage of households with three bins in some counties remained disgracefully low close to a million houses don’t have a brown bin service. For instance, it was as low as 2% in Donegal, 5.51% in Westmeath, 6.37% in Cavan, 8.9% in Mayo, and 9.86% in Kilkenny. Leitrim, on the other hand, has managed a rate of 64.29%. If such a rate is possible with Leitrim’s rural profile then this should be readily achievable for all counties, and we should be aiming for even higher than this.

We also want to see new specific targets set for recycling in places of employment – an area that we feel has been badly neglected.

Promote responsible disposal and exploitation of waste

We strongly support the principle that waste is treated/disposed of as close as possible to where it is generated. This is not only in the interests of fairness but it also incentivises waste reduction within regions, and minimises emissions, congestion and pollution risk associated with transporting waste across the country

We will insist on transparent emissions monitoring for all waste facilities. We believe current systems are inadequate, especially in respect of waste incinerators.

In some cases, waste licences are being granted on inappropriate sites close to residential homes. We will insist that the EPA and Local Authorities meet their responsibilities in terms of only allowing waste operations on suitable sites and under strict and enforceable conditions. We will insist on proper compliance with the assessment process.

We favour the introduction of a levy on aggregates such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone that are extracted from the ground and used in construction and it should be set at a level to encourage the recycling of construction and demolition waste and to reduce the amount of waste being landfilled. All proceeds should be set aside for the environmental fund.

Set New Waste Structures

We are calling for a fundamental review of the effectiveness of the Repak Scheme in terms of how we approach waste and the respective roles of producers, retailers and consumers. In particular, we need to re-examine responsibilities of retailers and manufacturers in terms of reducing the amount of plastics used for the packaging of products, especially loose products. Local Authorities end up picking up the costs of this flawed system.

The waste sector in Ireland is not adequately regulated. There is still no economic regulator for the sector. This has meant that several areas of the country have no competition for their waste services. It has also led to a situation where, almost uniquely in developed countries, Ireland has a “side-by-side” competition model for waste services – by far the most cost-intensive model a country can have. The lack of a regulator also makes it very difficult to apply basic standards to waste companies.

The Social Democrats support calls made by the More Power to You campaign but in particular the call that a regulator be appointed immediately to the waste sector. The Social Democrats believe the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities should be established as the regulator of the waste industry, and that in the short-term we should transition to a system whereby competition works on a “for the market” basis. We believe this can allow for the remunicipilisation of waste services in certain circumstances and we note the savings that accrued in Lyon and some other cities when this happened.

Ultimately, we would like to see a transition to full remunicipilisation where resources, costs and consumer interests allow. We would also set the new regulator the task of introducing a national waiver scheme.

The Plastic Problem and how our Councils can help

Plastic has become endemic in our culture. It is now almost impossible to avoid purchasing daily necessities without also having to purchase some plastic packaging.

And while plastic brings many benefits, there is a growing problem worldwide of plastic pollution and particularly with single use plastics and our “throwaway” culture - everything from vinegar and shampoo sachets to birthday party goodie-bags and drinking straws. We use them once for perhaps thirty seconds and it can take half a millenium to break down. It is the very definition of unsustainable.

The damage to our oceans is potentially catastrophic with some estimates warning that we could have more plastic than fish in our oceans by the middle of this century. And scientists still have yet to confirm what exactly plastic pollution is doing to our food chain and the potential long-term risks to human health.

The Social Democrats recognise that there is an urgent need to reduce the demand for and supply of plastics and we commit to the following measures:

The Social Democrats welcome and support EU initiatives on this issue. However, we believe a 2030 target for the achievement of some of the objectives around plastics is not ambitious enough and we believe Ireland should go much further much sooner.

As an interim measure, we are seeking a levy on plastics that cannot be easily recycled in Ireland at the moment. In the medium-term, we would put the onus back on producers to recover plastics that they produce or else just stop using plastic in their production. In tandem with this, Local Authorities should take a pro-active approach to ensure the development of further recycling facilities so that a wider range of material (for instance black plastics and some soft plastics) is recyclable right across the country. Our Councillors will take a lead on this.

We support the introduction of a ban on all unnecessary single use plastics such as takeaway coffee cups, knives and forks, and other items.

We favour the immediate banning of micro-plastics – legislation in this area is taking far too long.

We would introduce a deposit return scheme for recyclable containers (and other waste streams where possible)building on the excellent examples in Norway, Sweden and Germany and Local Authorities can help with the roll-out of such a scheme.

We would aggressively promote the development of re-fill options in retail to minimise the unnecessary production of more plastic containers and we will encourage more local authorities to provide refill water dispensers so that the demand for plastic bottles is reduced.

We will promote beach, canal, and neighbourhood clean-up days with a special emphasis on removing plastic pollution.

We will seek to put an end to singleuse plastic at council events and insist on time-lines to end or reduce them in council supported events.

Promoting Biodiversity – Green Communities

There is growing concern worldwide about the impact of human development on biodiversity on our planet. Depletion of wildlife and insect loss have become very significant environmental issues.

The Social Democrats will ensure that each of our Councils take biodiversity seriously. We will promote a concept we are calling Green Communities, whereby Councils would seek to promote biodiversity as much as possible within a given zone.

Under our proposals, the Council would prioritise measures such as:

The planting of trees and flowers in existing and new developments, and on streets.

Significantly reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides in public green spaces and, where possible, in gardens.

Create native Woodland Walks and Wildflower Meadows in existing and new parks.

Place more bins and reduce litter to keep parks, waterways and beaches clean.

Create wild picnic bench spots in developments and near offices, and encourage the creation of rooftop gardens in offices and apartments.

Where feasible we will seek to recruit biodiversity officers and ecology officers in the Councils we are represented on or appoint an existing staff member to that role.

We also favour the development of a national hedgerow conservation strategy so that a correct balance can be struck between the interests of landowners, road users and the habitats of our native wildlife.

We will vigorously pursue blue flag status for beaches in our coastal communities.

Creating Energy Communities

The Social Democrats believe that Local Authorities can play a much bigger role in relation to energy.

At the moment, over a million Irish household overpay for their electricity. The number of gas customers who overpay is probably over 400,000. A significant part of the problem is that the consumer model that has developed for gas and electricity is based on the capacity, inclination and confidence of customers to keep switching their energy provider. If you don’t switch regularly, you end up paying more. In some cases, you will pay more if you switch only once than if you never switched at all.

This model doesn’t work and a growing body of international research shows that under this model the most vulnerable pay the highest prices. For this and other reasons, the UK has brought in price controls for three categories of customers.

Meanwhile, those dependent on oil fired central heating face sporadic fluctuations in their heating bills depending on the international price of oil at the time of purchase and how competitive the local market is. There is no regulator for the sector in Ireland and people who can only afford small top-ups pay the highest prices.

At the same time, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is sponsoring an initiative called Better Energy Communities, whereby communities come together to promote energy saving in their communities. This has had some success but most communities in Ireland have not benefitted from it and many have not even heard of it.

The Social Democrats believe that Ireland can do much more to promote sustainable and affordable energy and that Local Authorities can be significant players in this.

Too often, the debate on energy pits environmental sustainability against affordability. We have seen this in the debate on higher carbon taxes. This is unfortunate in our view.

Sustainability and affordability should be dealt with side by side. Climate change is a real thing and the role of carbon is undeniable. Equally, energy poverty is a real thing and blindly lumping more taxes on the most vulnerable in our society is simply creating another problem and undermining public support in the fight against climate change.

The Social Democrats believe that energy policy should be based on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals set us the objective of tackling climate change and preventing poverty at the same time – ie: the two go hand in hand.

In that vein, we believe Local Authorities can play a very significant role in promoting a new community-focus on energy policy.

The Social Democrats are proposing the establishment of an energy unit in multiple Local Authorities on a regional basis. These units would facilitate the development of local energy communities (leaning on resources of the SEAI) and would help roll out pilot energy programmes across multiple Local Authorities.

The new units would facilitate a new pilot programme of group switching of electricity and gas customers and of group purchase among oil customers. It would be open to all residents in the Councils’ administrative area – whether a tenant or owner-occupier.

Such models have already worked well in Northern Ireland in terms of oil clubs, and there are some good examples in England where group switching has been accommodated by either the Regulator or by Local Authorities. By grouping together, energy customers can enjoy savings from bulk purchasing and do not have to go through the tortuous ritual each year of switching energy provider just to protect themselves against big increases.

Under our proposal, a condition of participation in this scheme would be that a proportion of the savings accruing from bulk switching would have to be applied to energy efficiency improvements in people’s homes.

In this way, the Local Authority can play a very significant role in reducing the unit-cost of energy faced by residents, reducing the overall cost of energy by energy efficiency measures, and facilitating the retro-fitting of hundreds of thousands of homes in Ireland.

Other proposals on Energy
We will heavily promote the retro-fitting of existing Local Authority Housing stock to reduce carbon emissions from this sector.
We will ensure that housing energy standards on all new developments is rigorously applied in planning conditions.
We will use all influence available to the Council to promote, facilitate and grow community micro-generation.
Bodies such as the Tipperary Energy Agency have shown the enormously positive impact communities can make. We will seek to emulate this right across the country.
We will extend the number of public charging points for electric vehicles

Council Services – Focussing on the Basics

The Social Democrats want to set new standards in how public services are delivered by local authorities and how local officials engage with local communities. As is evident throughout this Manifesto, we want to spread best practice across the country. What works in the recycling centre in Bray or the Community Budgeting in South Dublin can work everywhere else.

As a first step, we want the role of National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) to be expanded. Far more measures of Council activity or lack thereof, should form part of its auditing processes. Communities should know how well their local Council is doing across every possible measure of service.

Social Democrats Councillors will vigorously pursue Council management on doing basic public services well and as promptly as possible.

Our Councillors will use the Council’s Service Delivery Plan and our monthly Council meetings to focus Council attention on delivering these basic services and improving Council performance in the following key areas:

In addition to these, there are specific areas where we feel Councils generally can do so much better:

We would like Councils to make it as easy as possible for residents to pay their bills with them – in particular we would like to see a pay-as-you-go book scheme adopted by Councils to facilitate the payment of Motor Tax so that low-income households are not faced with very large one-off annual bills that send them into the hands of money-lenders (we believe this model could also improve rents collection). We would also like to a see a restructuring of motor tax charges so that people who can only afford nonannual tax discs are not ripped-off by unjustified additional charges.

We will seek to improve Council training and other supports for the establishment of Residents Associations or local environmental groups. We will promote active community sections within our Councils and we are keen to spread best practice around the country such as community days, street feasts, summer projects, and events for older people.

We will establish a specific Council forum for apartment dwellers so that their concerns can be heard and responded to by Council officials and to facilitate peer learning. Such forums have worked very well in some Councils and have proven useful in advocating the interests of people living in apartments.

We are keen to promote customer service initiatives in our Councils so that there are strong and regular feedback opportunities for the public on services that are working well or are under-performing.

We are particularly keen to explore how leaf collection could be expanded by Councils.

The issue of having road safety and basic traffic requests considered is cumbersome and slow in several Councils and we believe can be vastly improved with a better management system.

We will ensure that Councils meet their obligations under the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.

We will work with Councils to adopt an anti-racism strategy for each Council area in respect of Council services and duties.

We will work to improve the relationship between Councils and utility network providers so that the visual impact of unsightly electricity and gas housing is minimised and does not present a hazard to people with disabilities. We will also seek to place far greater onus on such providers to ensure that their equipment is kept graffiti-free.

We will use our position on the boards of Education and Training Boards to promote educational access for all and high education standards and to uphold the constitutional rights of children and their parents to not attend religious instruction classes.

We will support fair and equal access to Council commissioning processes and we will work to extend the supports available through Local Enterprise Offices to community and voluntary groups, charities and social enterprises.

We commit to a “plain English” approach in all Council material, and we will be encouraging each of our Councils to work with the National Adult Literacy Agency in executing this approach

We will use the Council’s role as part of the County Childcare Committee to promote much better information to parents on childcare options and to better inform policy in respect of capacity shortages and fee increases.

Unfinished Estates

The communities who are currently worst served by our Councils are those of new and unfinished estates.

The Social Democrats have huge concerns about how long the taking-incharge process can be in some local authorities. Many residents have been left with completely unsatisfactory services such as roads, pathways, public lighting, green spaces, lack of amenities and in particular service connections. This leaves residents in limbo and in some cases residents end up having to pay for basic public services such as street lighting, road repairs and liability insurance. In some cases, estates have been waiting since the 1990s.

At the last count, 4,854 housing developments were waiting to be taken in charge. We are particularly concerned that 834 estates remain who continue to rely on temporary water infrastructure – so called DPI estates.

We are also concerned that a €10m Local Authority fund dedicated to takingin-charge was not fully drawn down by Local Authorities and that three councils, Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and Louth did not avail of any.

Our Councillors will make this a priority issue and fervently represent the interests of residents living in unfinished estates. We will ensure that all available funding is applied for.

We will ensure our local authorities have a proper tracking system in place so that these estates are not forgotten and that developers are constantly reminded of their outstanding responsibilities. We will put a particular emphasis on resolving outstanding issues in DPI developments.

We will not accept sub-standard finishing from developers and ensure that a robust bonds system is in place so that there are appropriate incentives for developers to finish out estates.

Nationally, we will seek much stronger protection for residents, including strengthening the powers of local authorities to be much more pro-active in taking new developments in charge, stronger powers of enforcement for local authorities to pursue developers, and having a dedicated fund to help the worst affected estates. We will ensure that Irish Water has a much more constructive approach to the problem and that there are clear targets set for it in relation to taking in charge.

We also want to see the Local Property Tax reviewed so that some arrangement is in place for lower charges where estates are liable for the tax but are waiting to be taken in charge. This will be fairer to residents and give every incentive to local authorities to work with developers to get estates finished quickly.

Promoting Enterprise and Strong Local Economies

Councils can contribute hugely to the economic success of their administrative areas by promoting and facilitating strong partnerships with the local business community, and by setting the right conditions for business.

In the context of Brexit and the looming economic threat that this entails it is all the more important that Councils have enterprise at the heart of their strategies.

Each Council must be cognisant of the key drivers of economic development in their area, the key industries at the heart of this, and adopt strategies to protect and enhance these sectors. Below we set out some of the priorities for Social Democrats Councillors.

Our Councillors are committed to the following measures:

We will work with the business community to facilitate and sustain jobs-rich enterprise opportunities and to promote economic development.

We will ensure that sustainable economic development, job creation, and job sustainment are key goals of the development plan in every Council we are represented on.

We will prioritise tourism and heritage and believe our Councils can contribute significantly to better offerings on these across a number of their competencies including planning and development, planning enforcement, signage, promotion, litter control, beach and parks maintenance, and in the expansion of festivals, cultural events, eco-tourism and greenways.

We endorse Chambers Ireland’s calls for greater focus on enterprise training, through the Local Employment Offices (LEO) and other state agencies, and new strategies that seek to maximise the participation of everyone currently excluded from the workforce. We will seek to create local skills censuses and develop complementary training programmes which address local skill gaps.

We will insist on fair and transparent public procurement processes and seek to give stronger weighting in procurement competitions to bids from those with strong labour and environmental protection offerings.

We are keen to promote all green economy and social enterprise possibilities and we will explore all avenues to fund green energy and enterprise training in rural and regional areas to help people supplement their agri-food income - as proposed by Chambers Ireland.

We will prioritise the rejuvenation of our Main Streets to encourage greater footfall, discourage vacancy, to improve vibrancy, and make them places people want to regularly shop, visit, meet friends and live in.

We will seek to expand the shop-front scheme as it is currently quite limited in scope.

We will ensure that the rates regime is fair and transparent and promotes competitiveness. We will seek to raise collection rates to 97% so that Local Authorities have more revenue and so that compliant businesses are not competing against non-payers. We will seek to use some of this extra funding to lower rates where possible.

We will promote the development of Community Hubs which would provide hot-desks, co-working facilities, hi-speed broadband and conference and meeting spaces to local businesses and remote workers.

We will ensure that adequate rates rebate schemes are in place for businesses facing genuine trading difficulties and for start-ups – as long as such a scheme would not distort competition between neighbouring outlets.

Nationally, we are very concerned about the failure of Government to tackle the high cost of public liability insurance faced by many businesses, but particularly those with high footfall. Our representatives will strongly push this issue on behalf of local businesses until the excessive court awards for minor injuries (which is at the heart of our very high insurance costs for public liability) are more in line with international norms. We also need to see far more action by the Government and regulators to promote sustainable competition in the insurance market – the current competition model has failed.

Fair Funding for Local Authorities

There are four main income sources for Local Authorities.

These comprise of:
Local Authority Rates (collected from local businesses), 
- Local Property Tax Receipts (collected from local home-owners but distributed from a central fund) 
- Grants from Central Government (mainly from the Departments of Housing, Transport, and Communications) 
- Goods and Services provided by Local Authorities Under this system Local Authorities depend very heavily on Central Government to fund basic public services.

However, the Social Democrats are not satisfied that the current system is evidence-based. There is wide variation in how different counties benefit under this system. In particular, population size, population changes, staff ratios, and infrastructure deficits are not adequately factored in to how grants and the proceeds of the Local Property Tax are distributed to local Councils.

Local Property Tax funding

There are a number of key problems with how funding raised through the Local Property Tax (LPT) is distributed. We set these out in a submission on the review of the tax in July 2018.

The first issue is that the Local Property Tax has not boosted Council funding. Part of the rationale for introducing the Local Property Tax in the first place was to ensure that funding to Local Authorities could be stabilised and improved and, in turn, used to improve local services. This simply hasn’t happened. The financial position of Local Authorities has not significantly improved since before the LPT was introduced. What gains the LPT has provided to Local Authorities has been taken away by the withdrawal of Motor Tax funding and a reduction in central Government grants in roads and housing. It is a sneaky element of austerity that has yet to be corrected.

Communities can rightly ask: “what am I getting for my Local Property Tax?” The answer is - not a whole lot more.

Another key problem is that the allocation of the LPT to our local Councils is not evidence-based.

Under current arrangements, the equalisation fund redistributes funding from high-revenue counties to lowrevenue counties and does so on the basis of each Council’s needs (or so-called “baselines”).

This is fine in theory. However, in practice it presents a severe disadvantage to Councils experiencing significant population growth.

This is partly because each Council’s baseline has not been properly updated since the early 2000s. It means that baselines no longer reflect the true financial needs of each Council.

This results in a transfer that particularly advantages counties such as Donegal, Mayo and Tipperary but means that Councils such as Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, Fingal, South Dublin, Galway City Council, Clare and others lose significant funds.

Some of the Councils with the lowest staff ratios per head of population lose the most out of this process. It is simply unfair.

The Social Democrats believe that the way in which the proceeds of the Local Property Tax are distributed needs to be overhauled. It firstly needs to factor in population growth and the needs that clearly arise for Local Authorities from that. It also must allow far greater weighting to the number of staff and skill mix in each county.

The Department of Housing should go back to the drawing board and reestablish each Local Authorities’ true needs. These needs should be updated regularly to allow for demographic shifts, infrastructure deficits, and other changes. Critically, allocations need to be based on workforce planning so that the Councils with the lowest staffing levels per capita do not also lose significant amounts of LPT revenue. The Local Property Tax should then be distributed on a much fairer basis than is currently the case.

This would mean increased funding for those Councils with the biggest population increases in recent years. It would also mean that the Local Property Tax would be much more of a true “local tax”.

We recognise that this will impact on some Councils who rely on the equalisation fund. With that in mind we proposed as part of our Alternative Budget for 2019 that a transition fund starting with €25m be established for these Councils. In addition, we sought extra funding to invest in extra personnel to help with the collection of commercial rates in each county. The collection rates in some counties remain too low and a proper system could significantly boost income for some Councils.

Local Authority Grants

The distribution of Local Authority Grants from Central Government is also not done on a fair basis. Many of the same local authorities that suffer from the unfairness of how the Local Property Tax operates, for instance Meath and Kildare, are hit with the same unfairness under this grant system.

The Social Democrats are calling for a complete overhaul of how this system operates so that allocations operate on the basis of an objective resource allocation model. Population growth and service deficits should be much more central to the value of grants given out.

Collection of Commercial Rates

While there have been some welcome improvements in the collection of Local Authority rates in recent years, there is still much room for improvement in many areas.

There is a collection rate of 97% under the Local Property Tax. Disappointingly, the average per Local Authority in Commercial Rates is only 84%.

The most up to date comparative data across Local Authorities shows that while Fingal Co. Council leads the way on 96%, eight local authorities have collection rates of less than 80%.

Such a low collection rate means that compliant businesses are doubly disadvantaged. They are paying rates while their competitors are not, and the level of the rate struck is higher than it otherwise would be if everyone was paying their fair share. If we want our local Councils to provide all of the basic public services that we rely on, then everyone who can afford to contribute must do so.

The Social Democrats would invest in supports and expertise to assist those poor performing local authorities to boost their collection rates so that these Councils can become more self-sustaining

and less reliant on central funds. This would entail reviewing where each authority is falling down and providing them with advice and extra staff to improve rates collection. We also believe there is much scope for peer-learning on this issue.

Vacant Units

Several Councils offer discounts on rates for vacant commercial premises. The Social Democrats believe significant rates discounts for vacant premises encourages the dis-use of shops and is one of the main factors in why so many of our Main Streets and Town Centres are empty, run-down or littered with shuttered premises. Indeed, vacant units impact on footfall and impede the commercial interests of neighbouring outlets.

Our Councillors will, over time, seek to eliminate discounts on commercial rates to encourage occupancy.

We accept this measure will impact differently on different areas depending on the level of economic activity in the area so we would allow local Councillors apply discretion as to how long a unit would have to be vacant in a given area before the discount would no longer apply.

Rejuvenating our Main Streets and Neighbourhood Shops

Our Town Centres, Main Streets and Neighbourhood Shops are often the centre-points of our neighbourhoods. They are some of the most prominent spaces we share and come together as a community. They significantly contribute to our identity and give a strong sense of where we come from.

Yet, too often in Ireland, they can be the worst kept, worst planned, least loved areas. We have to rethink how we support businesses and enterprises at local level to ensure the vitality of our towns, villages and urban villages.

It is no surprise that towns and villages with a vibrant, bustling core, with well-maintained shops, a diverse range of outlets, attractive streetscapes, a strong traffic plan and good access, are often the places where communities are most active. Thriving, vibrant main streets are central to the sustainability of our towns and villages as places to live and work.

The Social Democrats want to put these shopping areas back at the top of the Councils’ agenda. We will prioritise rejuvenation of these parts of our towns and villages to stimulate economic development and local job creation, promote regional economic development, protect the interests of main street traders and give a leg-up to small businesses, innovators and entrepreneurs, encourage re-population of our town centres, while also encouraging community, sporting and arts groups to use our main streets in practical and innovative ways. Alongside our other plans for strengthened local government and stronger communities, we are making the following proposals to boost support to our Main Streets and Neighbourhood Shops:

Promote Regional Economic Development

We should be using the National Development Plan to invest in projects that boost industrial and commercial capacity across the country such as improved rural broadband, transport, electricity capacity and third level technological centres. This will improve local economies, employment opportunities, boost purchasing power and retail possibilities across the country, and help provide economic counterweights to Dublin.

End Rates Rebate on Vacant Premises

As we have set out earlier, at the moment the owners of vacant commercial premises can claim a refund on commercial rates from their local authority if their premises are vacant. This simply encourages the proliferation of shuttered, empty and under-used premises on many of our Main Streets. No rebates should be available for premises that remain vacant after a reasonable period is allowed for re-letting or re-use, to be set by each local authority. We will especially encourage the use of empty premises by community, sports, social and arts groups.

Improve Local Authority Funding

Central funding of local authorities must be improved to allow them adjust their commercial rates and street-parking rates to promote the commercial viability of Main Street businesses. Funding should also be provided for environmental improvement works such as street lighting, footpaths, parking, cycling infrastructure, accessibility for wheelchairs and buggies, landscaping and street furniture.

As we have referred to earlier, we would also like to see seed funding provided to local authorities to help improve the collection of commercial rates and apply at least some of these savings to help lower rates overall.

Town and Village Regeneration

A Government scheme, the Town and Village Scheme, currently provides funding to help rejuvenate local communities. However, many urban pockets in need of such funding cannot currently qualify. This scheme needs to be better funded and to be expanded to allow urban villages to benefit.

In addition, we would ensure that the shop-front improvement grant scheme is enhanced and available to all towns and villages.

Each of our Councillors will push for a specific budget for “neighbourhood shops” in their Council area to improve the appearance of these key focal points in communities and to make such shops more accessible for people with disabilities, cyclists and pedestrians.

We will support our communities in making bids under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.

Strictly enforce out-of-town shopping centre planning guidelines

A strong set of planning guidelines exists to protect the interests of Main Streets and Town Centres when planning applications for out-of-town shopping centres are being considered.

However, these have not always been well observed or applied by planning authorities.

We are in favour of setting the new planning regulator with the task of ensuring that planning authorities strictly enforce planning guidelines so that Main Streets are not adversely affected by new developments.

Tackle Vacant and Derelict Sites and run-down shops

The law needs to change to give better powers to local authorities in tackling vacant and derelict sites and shops.

In 2017, the Social Democrats introduced a Bill, the Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill, to the Dáil which would promote the development and activation of vacant and derelict sites in our cities, towns and villages.

We need to see all Local Authorities take the Vacant Site Levy seriously, apply it to all vacant sites, and apply a higher vacant site levy the longer a site remains vacant. Such measures would help end the underuse of town centre sites, counter land-hoarding, and minimise dereliction.

We also favour the strengthening of the role of local authority staff, such as Public Domain Officers, to intervene with businesses who fail to maintain their premises to an acceptable standard at the expense of neighbouring businesses.

End Upward Only Rents

Rents are a key part of the cost-base for Main Street businesses and are a major factor in the viability of many independently-owned stores.

Upward-only rents can undermine businesses because their sheer inflexibility does not take account of the ups and downs of the business cycle. We will seek to amend the Constitution to ensure that legislation could be enacted banning upward only rents.

Repopulation of Main Streets

We will promote the repopulation of urban centres by encouraging over-theshop conversion to residential through new planning guidelines and using existing Government incentives such as the Repair and Lease scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Town and Village scheme.

Town Website & Local Branding

We will promote the development of a Town website and social media presence with listings of all shops, services, contacts, events, promotions, opening times etc.

We will also push for some funding for the development of local branding, such as a county flag or other regional branding, to support indigenous producers and local independent shops.

Promote Community Banking

It is a long-standing aim of the Social Democrats to support the provision of community banking across Ireland.

This would improve the availability of credit in local communities using Credit Unions and Post Offices.

It would provide far better competition in lending to small businesses and in basic banking fees. Keeping post offices and credit unions viable would also animate town and village centres and increase footfall for local businesses.

Community Hubs

We will promote the development of Community Hubs which would provide hot-desks, co-working facilities, hi-speed broadband and conference and meeting spaces to local businesses and remote workers. These could be provided in under-used or disused buildings or as a section of a local library or Council office. The more we can promote a communitycentred approach, the greater vibrancy and economic sustainability in our local communities.

Rates Rebates

Our Councillors will ensure that adequate rebate schemes are in place for community facilities, businesses facing genuine trading difficulties and for those who need assistance in the start-up phase – subject to a provision that such a scheme would not distort competition between neighbouring outlets.

Stricter Planning Rules

We will use the Council development plan process to set down strict conditions in planning applications around delivery times and access points.

We will set down strict conditions on the duty of take-away shops to have litter control plans in their communities. We will adopt a “no-fry zone” in relation to new takeaways proposed close to schools (and seek to restrict advertising also).

We will restrict the proliferation of off-licences and bookmakers. Every Social Democrats Councillor will ensure that a plan for neighbourhood shops is a clear objective of their County Development Plan.

Honest and Open Councils

Most Councillors strive to do their best for their communities. Sadly, however, the history of local government in Ireland is also littered with malpractice, corruption, back-handers, and abuse of our planning system.

The Social Democrats want to stamp this out once and for all.

A long-standing aim of the Social Democrats is the establishment of an AntiCorruption Agency. Such an agency is a vital law enforcement tool to help eradicate corrupt practices in politics and business in Ireland. We remain absolutely committed to its establishment.

If we are to build public trust in local democracy, then transparency, accountability, and integrity must be the defining features of local decisionmaking.

At local level, the Social Democrats are putting honesty and transparency at the heart of what we do as Councillors.

Our Councillors will proactively publish their annual declarations of interest online and will work to ensure that this becomes routine practice in all local authorities.

Our Councillors will also ensure the highest levels of integrity in dealing with lobbyists – this includes declaring their status as Designated Public Officials under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.

We will strive to ensure that all Council meetings are web-cast.

Social Democrats Councillors will not participate in the “conference culture” that still affects many Councils and will seek to eradicate this practice from all Councils of which we are a member. We believe that training for Councillors should be provided in-house as much as possible. This must include training for Councillors and council staff alike in their obligations under our ethics laws and related codes of conduct.

The Social Democrats accept all of the recommendations for Local Authorities made by both the Mahon Tribunal and Transparency Ireland (TI) in its report “Integrity Index 2018”. The TI report highlights the good practice and shortcomings in all 31 local authorities in the State. It highlights the strong work on ethics and transparency in Local Authorities such as Galway City, Monaghan, Dublin City, South Dublin and Fingal and the much weaker systems in Local Authorities such as Galway County, Waterford, Wexford and Offaly.

The Social Democrats will seek to develop and maintain up-to-date, comprehensive Corruption and Fraud Prevention and Contingency Plans in every Local Authority on which we serve. We will ensure there are proper procedures in place for Ethics Registrars. We will ensure that all consultations that qualify as preplanning consultations under Section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (not just formally requested consultations) are adequately documented and published on the Council’s website. We also want Councillors’ annual declarations of interests published on every Local Authority website.

We believe the tool-kit set out by Transparency Ireland is a good reference point for Local Authorities to work from and we will strive to improve the position of every Council on which we are represented.

At national level, the Social Democrats will continue to highlight the government’s inexcusable footdragging when it comes to implementing the ethics reforms recommended by the Mahon Tribunal in 2012. The Public Sector Standards Bill was introduced to the Oireachtas in 2015 and is going nowhere fast because there is simply no political drive behind it. We are determined to have this legislation passed.

Directly Elected Mayors

The Social Democrats favour the introduction of Directly Elected Mayors in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford.

In our vision of the role, a directly elected Mayor would provide strategic leadership and vision for our cities.

Each candidate for the office would have an opportunity to outline their plans for their city and county over the course of their mandate. This electoral mandate would provide a powerful impetus for modernisation and change. It would raise service standards in local authorities and make them far more accountable.

We are particularly keen to see Directly Elected Mayors take a role in Transport policy. We believe this could have a hugely positive impact on tackling traffic congestion, promoting cycling, and would help with the championing and implementation of transport plans.

Directly Elected Mayors would bring stakeholders together – in particular, the multitude of public service bodies that are active in our cities. They would take the lead on areas such as economic and tourism development, engaging with Gardaí, and creating safer public spaces. The Directly Elected Mayor would also lead on waste management, environmental sustainability, housing and homelessness, and social inclusion.

Initiatives and collaborations to make our cities more inclusive, including an age-friendly strategy and promoting cultural diversity and youth programmes, could be led by the Mayor and could include public art programmes and cultural events. A directly-elected Mayor would have the mandate to bring people together to lead a safer cities initiative to make public spaces safer and more accessible for everyone. The Mayor could provide a leadership role in co-ordinating actions amongst agencies to meet Climate Change and recycling targets.

We set out our thinking in relation to a Directly Elected Mayor for Dublin last year in Democratising Dublin. and with careful tailoring, we believe this can be the blueprint for all Irish Cities with such an office.

We believe that additional central funding should be provided to pay for this additional office and the election process.

Better Policing

The Social Democrats believe policing in our community could work so much better if there was greater co-operation and consultation with communities and local Councillors.

The Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) and especially Community Safety/Policing Forums around the country are good models. They bring together Gardaí, senior Council officials and communities to discuss crime and anti-social activity in the local area. They have been a welcome improvement on making local Gardaí accountable and a good way of exchanging information on local issues. However, we are not maximising output from them.

For a start too few people know about them. Their effectiveness depends far too much on how active individual residents, Gardaí and Council staff are in the given area. Far too few people know how they can interact with them or how to have an issue raised and responded to. There are often unnecessary restrictions on the number of Councillors who can pose questions to them. And the remit of the JPCs is currently too restricted.

The Social Democrats wish to reform the JPCs. They have a more formal role in setting local policing plans. All elected Councillors should be able to pose a limited number of questions at their local JPC and Community Safety/Policing Forum. Gardaí should be required to provide information well in advance of meetings to allow for the smooth operation of JPCs. Contact details for the public and minutes of meetings should be clearly available on each local authority’s website and in public libraries. We will also seek to further improve co-operation between JPCs and drugs task forces.

All Social Democrats Councillors will actively engage with their JPCs and Community Safety/Policing Forums to represent crime and safety issues arising in their areas and ensure that their communities are well informed as to how the Council and local Gardaí are responding.

Separate from JPCs, we will promote development designs that promote “passive policing”, and seek to ensure that all public parks and public places are well lit and safe for all users.

On a national level, the Social Democrats will continue to seek the restoration of community Gardaí staffing levels.

Dogs

Dog Litter
Dog litter is a real nuisance as well as presenting a verifiable danger to public health – causing some eye diseases and in some cases, sight loss.

The Social Democrats wish to replicate a successful community experiment carried out in Beaumont in Dublin where dispensers with free doggy bags were erected at entrances to a park. The experiment has resulted in a very significant decline in the problem and we are keen to expand it to as many areas as possible. The marginal cost for the Council is very low and can be met out of existing funding.

We also wish to expand the number of bins so that dog-owners can easily dispose of dog litter.

On the spot litter fines should be doubled from €150 to €300 to improve the deterrent of dog-owners not picking up after their pet.

Numbers Destroyed and Dog Pounds

There has been a welcome downward trend (PQ: 11332/19) in the number of dogs that are euthanized by local authorities – falling by over half in recent years according to the official statistics. However, some counties continue to have high rates, including Kerry, Tipperary and Wexford.

Our local representatives will be working towards bringing down these rates across all counties with a clear priority of finding homes for dogs.

Meanwhile, we remain very concerned that some of the standards at our publicly-funded dog pounds are not at the required level. We will seek to put new standards in place, to improve the regularity and stringency of welfare inspections, to insist on mandatory transparency of conditions in pounds to members of the public, and overall to ensure high standards for dogs that are in the care of the local authority or those contracted to them.

Dog-walking

We wish to encourage the use of our public parks by dog-owners. However, we recognise that a balance has to be struck between the interests of dog-owners and the interests of other park users, particularly young children. We are committed to adopting a dog-walking strategy for each Local Authority that will seek to balance these interests.",2019,"Local","Social Democrats","Social Democrats_2019_Local"
"Local 2019: Social Democrats (Cork)","Introduction

The Cork City Social Democrats believe that Cork can become a city that leads Ireland and the world in terms of quality of life. We believe that there is the potential to build an economic and cultural powerhouse in what will be soon the second largest English-speaking city in the EU.

To achieve this vision, bold decisions need to be taken across the city. We need plans to tackle the transport, environmental and housing problems that the city faces. We need focused action to make our city more liveable than it is today.

The City Council and our elected representatives should be the fulcrum for these bold decisions. They should be the ones driving the strategy for how we make Cork an even better place to live than it is today.

Our council should be working towards ensuring that every Corkonian has a roof over their heads by having a Cork City action plan for Homelessness and having an ambitious plan to build more social housing across the city.

Our council should have a plan to improve transportation across the city by focusing on how we can improve roads and public transport.

We know that not all the problems that Cork faces can be fixed by City Hall and we need a strong social democratic voice, at local, national and international level, but those elected to the City Council will be the voice of Cork for the next five years and as such they speak so that both those inside and outside of Cork will hear.

In this manifesto for Cork City, we outline the priorities that Social Democrat Councillors will be pushing for if elected to the City Council. Focusing on the following areas
• Democracy and Transparency
• Housing
• Transport
• Environment
• Planning

If you want change, vote for it. It’s time.

Democracy and Transparency

The Cork City Social Democrats believe that open and transparent government at the local level is a key factor to ensure that we have public services that deliver for the people of Cork City and that public trust in our institutions remains.

To support transparent government in Cork City we will support the following initiatives

City Council meetings should be open and accessible to all. To facilitate this, all council meetings should be streamed live on the internet via the City Council website.

Support the adoption of a Directly Elected Mayor for Cork City. Under the plans announced on 2 nd April by the Minister for State for Local Government JohnPaul Phelan, there will be a local plebiscite on a Mayor for Cork, and we urge the citizens of Cork to vote Yes.

If approved we will urge the Government to legislate for the new Mayor to have significant executive powers over budgets, resource allocation, planning, housing and transportation. This may require powers to be devolved from Central Government as well. We support this plan because we strongly believe that the path of democracy is best served by having the power to elect those who govern us. Today Ireland has the second weakest local government structure in Europe and Local Councillors have very little ability to influence the strategic direction for the services in the communities that they represent.

We support the introduction of a participatory budgeting scheme in Cork City. This is similar to that implemented in South Dublin County Council. A participatory budgeting scheme will democratically empower the citizens in a local community to determine how a portion of their public budget is spent to improve their community e.g. a new playground, GAA club improvements etc.

It is vital for citizens of Cork to understand how the City Council is raising and spending its money. Therefore, there should be within one week of the Council budget being approved, a one-page financial summary is to be made available publicly on the City Council website, that shows, the key sources of income and expenditure and what this means at a per citizen level. This will allow Corkonians to understand what services are being provided by the council, how much they cost and how they are being funded.

The City Council should continue its efforts to register voters and to encourage everyone to participate in elections.

Housing

Today, the average rent in Cork City is nearly €1,200 per month and the average cost to buy a home in County Cork has risen from 151,430 in 2014 to 228,000 today. As the city sees continued growth, there is ever more pressure on a limited stock of housing.

Cork Social Democrats believe that not only is housing a human right, but a lack of affordable housing is both detrimental to the sustainable economic growth and the social wellbeing of the people of Cork.

There have been calls from across the community including from pressure groups, unions, Business leaders and the Cork Business Association (CBA) for action on both derelict sites and on new housing.

To tackle this problem, Cork City Council needs to make more efficient use of its existing housing stock and work to address the issue of derelict sites and vacant homes.

Cork City Council needs to plan for the future. As the population of the city is projected to double over the next 25 years, the Council need to decide now on the location of new housing, the provision of services and transport and ensure that large housing projects are centred on building new communities, and not just a never-ending series of new estates.

Use of Existing Housing

Today Cork City Council has an average re-let time of 61 weeks whereas the best councils (SDCC) can do this in 10 weeks according to the National Oversight and Audit Commission Report Performance Indicators report 2017 report. The Cork Social Democrats would target council officials to reduce time and cost to the National averages of 29 weeks and €17,106 as opposed to the 61 weeks and €29,558 by leveraging best practice from other councils.

Cork Social Democrats would request funding for the Vacant Homes Officer become a permanent position from the 2 years trial it is today.

Would request the Council to publish online its register of Vacant Homes and Derelict sites in the same way that Cork County Council does today.

New Housing and Derelict sites

Cork City Council has a housing capital budget of over €500m for the years 2019 to 2021. The Cork Social Democrats believe that that number needs to double to €1bn in the period 2022 to 2025 to take into account the expanded population of the city and need for new housing.

We believe Cork City Council should establish an aggressive Housing plan that would aim to deliver an additional 5,000 new social houses from across the city in the period between 2022 and 2027. This is in comparison to the 2260 target for 2017 to 2021.

We will look for planning guidance that there is sufficient provision of accessible social housing across the city to ensure that there is adequate housing for those with additional needs.

To do this the Cork City Council should seek additional loan funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB) of €50m. EIB funding is available to local authorities and Government agencies at preferential rates of interest to fund infrastructure projects. We believe that a significant loan proposed will be revenue neutral as the loan will be repaid from income generated by the sale or rent of properties purchased. Funding should be secured for capital projects from 2022 onwards. Matched funding of €50m will be required from Central Government to enable this loan.

New funding should be directed towards two objectives:
• €50m to fund the purchase and redevelopment of Derelict sites.
• €50m for seed infrastructure to new development areas.

There should be a focus within the new developments on providing homes for downsizers, those over the age of 55 who wish to move from their existing large family homes into something that is easier to maintain.

We would encourage the development of apartments above shops on our Main Streets to encourage more people to live in the heart of Cork. This would not only help young professionals and young families relying on public transportation to live in the city, but it would also provide a boost to businesses on our Main Streets.

Transportation

Ease of getting around any city is one of the keys to making a city liveable. The Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS) will outline plans for future transportation links in Cork City and surrounding areas, and we urge for its speedy publication.

Cycling

The Bike Sharing scheme in Cork is popular. On average in 2017, there were more than 23,000 journeys undertaken by a “Coke bike” every month.

The Cork City Social Democrats will lobby for an extension of the Bike sharing scheme, especially to parts of the city such as Blackpool and Blackrock where the topography of the city makes it suitable for cyclists of all abilities.

Cork Social Democrats will work closely with the Cork Cycling Campaign who have led in the area of cycling alternatives for the city.

We also support segregating cycle lanes from vehicular traffic.

Public Transport

Bus Usage in Cork City increased by 19% between 2013 and 2017 and overall Bus Eireann usage increased 13.2% in 2018.

To support further increases in Public Transport in Cork, Social Democrats will lobby for increased bus services including increasing frequency of services on the Northside of the city and Glanmire.

We would support a city-wide public transport and traffic survey to tackle congestion and heavy traffic at rush hour. With our population increasing and more cars on our roads than ever, we must look at new solutions to make it easier to get around the city.

We support the continuation of the Pana bus lanes implemented in 2018 which are helping buses get through the city centre at peak hours in the evening.

We also support the ongoing City Centre Movement strategy that prioritises public transport corridors.

We will advocate for the continued expansion of Bus Éireann’s Regional Service accessibility fleet to ensure Cork City is accessible to all residents as well as those coming to the city for business or pleasure.

Roads

There is increasing traffic congestion in Cork City. To tackle this congestion, we believe that a citywide traffic management strategy, for the enlarged city needs to be developed. This should focus on traffic crunch points such as traffic entering Douglas, Grange and Rochestown, the main road in Ballincollig and the traffic entering the Blackpool shopping centre.

We believe that there should be a coordinated effort between the Garda and the city council parking enforcement team, to ensure that the existing rules on driving and parking in bus lanes, on yellow lines and in misuse of disability parking spaces in Cork City is enforced.

We would also lobby for analysis into a second crossing of the River Lee beyond Tivoli to reduce congestion on the Jack Lynch Tunnel, that now sees more than 68,000 cars per day, more than 3 times the number when the Tunnel opened 20 years ago. We would also lobby for a further study into a Northern relief road for Cork between Glanmire and Ballincollig.

Environment

Flood Defences.

The Cork Social Democrats believe that flood defences for Cork City are crucial for the success of the city and support schemes that will ensure that business and individuals are protected from flooding in the city centre.

While welcome the current OPW plans for flood defences are still flawed.

We believe that
• The cost estimates provided are too low, and this may lead to cost overruns and funding difficulties in the future.
• There has been a limited assessment made on the impact of the construction activity on the city, especially increased traffic congestion during construction.
• More research is needed into the effectiveness and location of pumping stations across the city centre island.
• Serious consideration should be given to a Tidal barrier scheme as proposed by the Save Cork City.

We support the Save Cork City campaign.

Parks and Public Spaces

Cork is underserved by public parks and play amenities. We believe that every child should be within 15-minute walk of an outdoor play facility and as such the investment in play facilities should not just be focused on Fitzgerald’s Park, Ballincollig regional park and other large facilities but must instead be located in parks and council-owned open space across the city.

We would like to see an additional €250,000 invested in additional play equipment across the city. This should be funded by increasing the Development Contribution.

Any future investment in parks should be designed with accessibility in mind. We will lobby for additional funds to upgrade existing park facilities in Cork City to make them more disability-friendly.

Community spaces that are open and accessible to all are vital in developing a thriving community.

The Cork Social Democrats will advocate for additional public meeting rooms to be developed in the City Centre and advocate for the purchase and development of city centre spaces for open-air public events.

Planning

Under the National Planning Framework published in February 2018, the Cork Metropolitan area is expected to grow its population from approximately 209,000 to 314,000 by 2040. To achieve this level of growth in addition to the massive expansion of infrastructure and expenditure there will need to be a local strategic framework developed to deliver this growth.

We would like to see local development plans created for each of the major settlements in Cork City.

These local plans should focus on how the additional housing and additional employment is developed in each of those communities.

An overall development plan should be created for the expanded City.

We believe that these plans should focus on bringing brownfield sites back into use, increasing the resident population within walking distance of the City and should focus on increasing density in central parts of our community.

We believe that planning guidance for new property development must ensure that new developments are linked to their communities and that the needs of pedestrians and cyclists be prioritised by the provision of well-lit paths between estates.

Accessibility

13% of Cork City’s population experience disability or impairment.

Cork City Social Democrats believe the city should be accessible to all its citizens.

To improve accessibility in the city, we would advocate for the following:
• That all future Cork City recreational projects include Changing Places facilities - accessible toilets which include a hoist, adult-sized changing bench and larger space for additional assistants, to ensure the health, safety and dignity of those with disabilities and mobility issues in Cork.
• That Cork City council implement the recommendations made by Inclusion Ireland in their 2016 Consultation on the Statement of Strategy for Transport, Tourism and Sport to install Changing Places facilities at large tourist destinations such as Blarney Castle as well as stadia, airports, train and bus stations.
• To place universal design at the forefront of all future Cork City developments.

Climate Change is the single biggest threat to our environment, to our living standards, to our existence.

The Social Democrats recognise this threat as a fundamental issue facing our country and our planet. Everybody has to play their part in tackling it and preparing for its consequences. We won’t be found wanting.

Throughout this document we set out a range of practical measures that our Councillors will be taking the lead in tackling climate change and protecting and enhancing our environment.

Our clear goal is to make each Council a Climate-focussed Council.

1. We will drive strong long-term planning and sustainable communities.
Strive for a climate-focussed Council with emphasis on reducing carbon footprint in everything the Council does or plans for - from transport planning and street lighting to treeplanting and recycling
 
Agree Local Area Plans that plan for public transport and community facilities before homes are built

2. We will support cycling and public transport.
Revise the National Development Plan so that spending on public transport and cycling are prioritised over roads

Build a Network of Segregated cycle lanes and new Greenways, and heavily promote cycling at all age and ability levels 

Pilot no/low fare public transport in a region/city/county in Ireland

3. We will promote biodiversity, recycling, and strong antidumping measures.
Create “Green Communities” with a special emphasis on enhancing biodiversity 

Introduce a completely new waste system so that unrecyclable packaging is phased out and plastic pollution is significantly reduced 

Increase fines for dumping and litter, and double funding for anti-dumping measures

4. We will encourage new energy solutions and put Councils at the heart of delivering them.
Pilot a new energy group scheme to be delivered by Local Authorities to help reduce costs to consumers and improve energy efficiency in homes 

Insist on high energy standards in every new building sanctioned by local authority planners and in all local authority housing stock

Climate Change

Climate change is a global issue that can only be tackled by every part of government doing its bit.

Nationally, we will continue to advocate for increased support for the development of off-shore wind, other blue energy, electric cars, and flood defences, a fair level of carbon tax that penalises polluters but doesn’t push people into poverty, and a new grants scheme for insulating homes that is available to everyone.

At local level, we see the new Climate Change Adaptation Strategies that are currently being adopted by Councils around the country as a key part in ensuring there is a workable and actionable plan in place to tackle climate change locally, and we will deliver on these plans. Such strategies are particularly important in respect of coastal erosion, flood defence and extreme weather event planning.

As Councillors, there are hundreds of ways that we can make an impact on climate change.

Some practical measures we are proposing include:

Councils leading by example in housing design and energy saving in its own buildings

Designated drop off points around our urban centres within 1 km radius of schools so students walk on dry mornings

Agree Local Area Plans that plan for public transport and community facilities before homes are built

Cycling Buses for children travelling to school

Promote the use of surplus heat in district energy schemes

Promote public awareness events on climate change, energy conservation etc.

Reduce the energy consumption of public lighting

Promote and expand number of community gardens and allotments where feasible

Public recycling bins

Better collection opportunity at amenity centres for mattresses, sofas, large plastic toys etc

An end to single-use plastic at council events and time-lines to end or reduce them in council supported events

Bicycle shelters & secure lock-ups at all public buildings

Wild flower gardens

Water fountains

Car-charging points in every small town and village

Car-pool initiatives

Tree-planting initiatives

Awards for the most environmentally friendly and most-environmentally improved multiple in your area

Please read further for other proposals in this area such as public transport, cycling, waste, dumping and energy

Promoting Public Transport

Traffic is choking our cities, towns and villages. Meanwhile too many Irish communities have no option but the motor car.

This didn’t happen by accident. It has been borne out of a longstanding neglect of public transport investment. Under successive Irish Governments, one abandoned or delayed public transport plan has followed another. Our inability as a country to adopt long term plans and implement them comes back to haunt us again and again.

The Social Democrats are committed to significant investment in both urban and rural public transport.

We believe that the National Development Plan was a missed opportunity with too little provided to this sector. We believe the National Development Plan should be redrawn so that public transport and cycling are re-prioritised over roads expenditure. This simply has to happen in order to reduce carbon emissions from the sector and to be able to plan for additional housing and sustainable communities.

Social Democrats Councillors will campaign strongly on behalf of their communities for significant improvements in local Public Transport. We will use every power available to local Councillors to facilitate the expansion of public transport services in our communities.

We are campaigning in favour of directly-elected mayors for Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford and we strongly believe that these mayors should assume responsibility for transport planning in each of these cities and counties with strong linkages with satellite counties

We will put transport planning at the heart of all significant housing plans. We must end the practice of building homes before we build the infrastructure that new communities will depend on.

We will ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are heard and responded to and that the issue of universal accessibility is put at the heart of all transport decisions affecting our Council areas.

We will continue to campaign for lower fares so that the use of public transport is encouraged and congestion reduced.

We would like to see no/low fare public transport piloted in Ireland.

We will invest heavily in cycling (see below)

We will promote active travel to schools and ensure that every Local Authority prioritises the provision of safe walking and cycling paths around every school in the country, so that those children who choose to walk, scoot or cycle to school, can do so safely.

We will ensure that public transport service providers play a full role in Council Transport policy meetings and we will seek to establish good accountability arrangements at these meetings so that Councillors can raise service issues for constituents.

We will ensure that the public know about every significant transport and traffic proposal relating to their community and that the public voice is heard in the decision-making process.

Getting Ireland Back on Its Bike

The benefits of cycling are enormous. And cyclist or not, everyone gains.
 With more cycling we get less pollution, less congestion, less carbon emissions.
 With more cycling we get healthier lifestyles and a more active population.
 With more cycling we get better mobility and quicker commuting times. 
 With more cycling we get safer streets and more liveable neighbourhoods 

Cycling saves time, saves money, and saves lives.

The Social Democrats will launch a 12-point plan for cycling. It sets out clear commitments to cycling including:
 Significantly improved Funding for Cycling 
 Proper Segregation for Safe Cycling and Improved Infrastructure 
 More Cycling Greenways and Urban Bike Schemes 
 Safer Cycling to School Better Enforcement 
 Improved Cycling Tax Schemes 
 Cycling Officers & Training

Our local Councillors will help put cycling at the heart of the thinking and strategy of each local authority we are represented in. Cycling should be recognised as a core element of transport policy and Social Democrats Councillors will make this happen.

The Plastic Problem and How Our Councils Can Help

Plastic has become endemic in our culture. It is now almost impossible to avoid purchasing daily necessities without also having to purchase some plastic packaging.

And while plastic brings many benefits, there is a growing problem worldwide of plastic pollution and particularly with single use plastics and our “throwaway” culture. In Ireland, only 36% of plastic packaging is recycled and we believe every level of Government must pay its part in improving this record.

The Social Democrats recognise that there is an urgent need to reduce the demand for and supply of plastics and we commit to the following measures:

The Social Democrats welcome and support EU initiatives on this issue. However, we believe a 2030 target for the achievement of some of the objectives around plastics is not ambitious enough and we believe Ireland should go much further much sooner.

As an interim measure, we are seeking a levy on plastics that cannot be easily recycled in Ireland at the moment.

In the medium-term, we would put the onus back on producers to recover plastics that they produce or else just stop using plastic in their production.

In tandem with this, Local Authorities should take a pro-active approach to ensure the development of further recycling facilities so that a wider range of material (for instance black plastics and some soft plastics) is

recyclable right across the country. Our Councillors will take a lead on this.

We support the introduction of a ban on all unnecessary single use plastics such as takeaway coffee cups, knives and forks, and other items.

We favour the immediate banning of micro-plastics – legislation in this area is taking far too long.

We would introduce a deposit return scheme for recyclable containers (and other waste streams where possible) building on the excellent examples in Norway, Sweden and Germany and Local Authorities can help with the roll-out of such a scheme

We would aggressively promote the development of re-fill options in retail to minimise the unnecessary production of more plastic containers and we will encourage more local authorities to provide refill water

dispensers so that the demand for plastic bottles is reduced.

We will promote beach, canal, and neighbourhood clean-up days with a special emphasis on removing plastic pollution

We will seek to put an end to singleuse plastic at council events and insist on time-lines to end or reduce them in council supported events

Tackling Litter and Illegal Dumping

We believe our Councils can play a much bigger role in tackling litter and illegal dumping. As judged by the number of fines issued, there is significant variance in the level of enforcement activity by local Councils.

The Social Democrats will ensure that every Local Authority adopts a clear strategy on dumping and takes a no-nonsense approach to offenders.

In general, our Councillors will take the following approach:

The Social Democrats favour a naming and shaming policy for people found guilty of illegal dumping. Our Councillors will explore all legal avenues to bring this in. We will seek to deploy technology wherever feasible to catch culprits.

We will seek to reverse the trend of Councils removing public bins. We are particularly anxious that bins are provided in areas such as bus-stops and taxi ranks, on approaches to schools, outside neighbourhood shops, ATMs etc.

An estimated 50,000 households dispose of their waste in an unregulated manner. We will focus councils’ attention on reducing this figure.

We will promote the expansion of Council furniture/junk collection days as resources allow.

We will promote and support residents clean-up days and work side by side with Tidy Towns committees to deliver cleaner environments in our communities.


Public facilities for disposal of non-recyclable material should have longer weekend and evening opening hours and we will push for extended hours where resources allow. The easier it is to dispose of unwanted goods the less likely there will be a problem with dumping.

Charges for bringing disposable items to public facilities should be as uniform as possible across the country and should be pitched at a level that discourages dumping.

We favour doubling on-the-spot fines for littering and increasing fines for illegal dumping.

In turn, we want to double funding to the anti-dumping initiative so that detection, enforcement and clean-ups can be improved.

It is vital that penalties for illegal dumping are actually applied. Enforcement bodies are too often failing in their duties to apply appropriate penalties. Our Councillors will work to ensure that fines are applied at a level that reflects the risk posed to or damage exacted on the environment.

Reducing our Waste

People want to do their best for their environment and play their part by recycling as much as possible. However, we are not making it easy for them.

Our current recycling system is a complete mess. There isn’t enough basic information for consumers on how and where you can recycle material, and the recycling system in Ireland can’t handle lots of goods that are sold in our shops. The Social Democrats want our Councils to start taking the lead again on recycling.

The three key points our Councillors would concentrate on are that
(a) consumers must have much better information so that they can make informed choices on minimising their waste and maximising their recycling, reuse, and repair opportunities
(b) we need a completely new waste process that is much more effective in minimising waste, so that the amount of unrecyclable products reaching our supermarket shelves is vastly reduced and so that recyclable waste that is currently not collected as part of household collection services can be recycled.
(c) Local Authorities can play a much bigger role by expanding the number of Civic Amenity Centres, making waste charges affordable, expanding opening hours of bring centres, and providing better options for recyclable material that is currently not part of kerbside collection.

We are proposing a mixture of practical local and national measures to vastly improve the effectiveness of Councils’ work on recycling and promoting the circular economy;

Better Recycling and Repair Options

We believe that funding for the development of recycling centres should be reinstated and the number expanded so that there is at least one civic amenity centre close to the population it is meant to be serving.

We would like to end the practice of waste collected in public bins going to landfill and

we will seek to roll-out segregated public waste bins.

We will promote local repair options for consumers – such as for mobile phones and other electronic devices.

Improved Information and Education for Consumers

We need far better customer information on recycling – what can be recycled, where and what bin can it go in. While the development of www.mywaste.ie has been welcome, it is far too basic. If waste can’t go in a household recycling or compost bin, then consumers should know where in their area an item can be recycled. Such information is not readily available in many local authorities.

And if it’s sold here with a recyclable label on it, then it should be actually recyclable here. There is also much confusion among the public as to what the different recycling emblems on packaging mean.

Our Councils can play a much stronger role in such basic information.

We believe education on recycling, reducing and re-using can also be improved in our schools - building on the success of the Green Flag initiative.

New Recycling Targets

We want to see new targets established for the percentage of domestic households and businesses that have recycling bin and compost bin services, with a particular focus on apartments and rural areas.

At the last count, the percentage of households with three bins in some counties remained disgracefully low about a million homes don’t have a brown bin service.

We also want to see new specific targets set for recycling in places of employment – an area that we feel has been badly neglected.

Promoting Responsible Disposal and Exploitation of Waste

We strongly support the principle that waste is treated/disposed of as close as possible to where it is generated. This is not only in the interests of fairness but it also incentivises waste reduction within regions, and minimises emissions, congestion and pollution risk associated with transporting waste across the country

We will insist on transparent emissions monitoring for all waste facilities. We believe current systems are inadequate, especially in respect of waste incinerators.

In some cases, waste licences are being granted on inappropriate sites close to residential homes. We will insist that the EPA and Local Authorities meet their responsibilities in terms of only allowing waste operations on suitable sites and under strict and enforceable conditions. We will insist that the assessment process is properly complied with.

We favour the introduction of a levy on aggregates such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone that are extracted from the ground and used in construction and it should be set at a level to encourage the recycling of construction and demolition waste and to reduce the amount of waste being landfilled. All proceeds should be set aside for the environmental fund.

We want to see new targets established for the percentage of domestic households and businesses that have recycling bin and compost bin services, with a particular focus on apartments and rural areas.

Setting New Waste Structures

We are calling for a fundamental review of the effectiveness of the Repak Scheme in terms of how we approach waste and the respective roles of producers, retailers and consumers.

In particular, we need to re-examine responsibilities of retailers and manufacturers in terms of reducing the amount of plastics used for the packaging of products, especially loose products. Local Authorities end up picking up the costs of this flawed system.

The Social Democrats support calls made by the More Power to You campaign but in particular the call that a regulator be appointed immediately to the waste sector.

The Social Democrats believe the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities should be established as the regulator of the waste industry, and that in the short-term we should transition to a system whereby competition works on a “for the market” basis. We believe this can allow for the remunicipilisation of waste services in certain circumstances and we note the savings that accrued in Lyon and some other cities when this happened.

Ultimately, we would like to see a transition to full remunicipilisation where resources, costs and consumer interests allow. We would also set the new regulator the task of introducing a national waiver scheme.

Promoting Biodiversity – Green Communities

There is growing concern worldwide about the impact of human development on biodiversity on our planet. Depletion of wildlife and insect loss have become very significant environmental issues.

The Social Democrats will promote a concept we are calling Green Communities whereby Councils would seek to promote biodiversity as much as possible within a given zone.

Under our proposal, the Council would prioritise measures such as:

The planting of trees and flowers in existing and new developments, and on streets.

Significantly reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides in public green spaces and, where possible, in gardens.

Create native Woodland Walks and Wildflower Meadows in existing and new parks.

Place more bins and reduce litter to keep parks, waterways and beaches clean.

Create wild picnic bench spots in developments and near offices and encourage the creation of rooftop gardens in offices and apartments.

Where feasible we will seek to recruit biodiversity officers and ecology officers in the Councils we are represented on or appoint an existing staff member to that role.

We also favour the development of a national hedgerow conservation strategy so that a correct balance can be struck between the interests of land-owners, road users and the habitats of our native wildlife.

We will vigorously pursue blue flag status for beaches in our coastal communities

Energy Communities

The Social Democrats believe that Local Authorities can play a much bigger role in relation to energy.

At the moment, over a million Irish household overpay for their electricity. The number of gas customers who overpay is probably over 400,000. A significant part of the problem is that the consumer model that has developed for gas and electricity is based on the capacity, inclination and confidence of customers to keep switching their energy provider. If you don’t switch regularly, you end up paying more. In some cases you will pay more if you switch only once than if you never switched at all.

This model doesn’t work and a growing body of international research shows that under this model the most vulnerable pay the highest prices. For this and other reasons, the UK has brought in price controls for three categories of customers.

Meanwhile, those dependent on oil fired central heating face sporadic fluctuations in their heating bills depending on the international price of oil at the time of purchase and how competitive the local market is. There is no regulator for the sector in Ireland and people who can only afford small top-ups pay the highest prices.

At the same time, the SEAI is sponsoring an initiative called Better Energy Communities, whereby communities come together to promote energy saving in their communities. This has had some success but most communities in Ireland have not benefitted from it and many have not even heard of it.

The Social Democrats believe that Ireland can do much more to promote sustainable and affordable energy and that Local Authorities can be significant players in this.

Sustainability and Affordability

Too often, the debate on energy pits environmental sustainability against affordability. We have seen this in the debate on higher carbon taxes. This is unfortunate in our view.

Sustainability and affordability should be dealt with side by side. Climate change is a real thing and the role of carbon is undeniable. Equally, energy poverty is a real thing and blindly lumping more taxes on the most vulnerable in our society is simply creating another problem and undermining public support in the fight against climate change.

UN SDGs

The Social Democrats believe that energy policy should be based on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals set us the objective of tackling climate change and preventing poverty at the same time – ie: the two go hand in hand

In that vein, we believe Local Authorities can play a very significant role in promoting a new community-focus on energy policy.

New ‘Energy Communities’

The Social Democrats are proposing the establishment of an energy unit in multiple Local Authorities on a regional basis. These units would facilitate the development of local energy communities (leaning on resources of the SEAI) and would help roll out pilot energy programmes across multiple Local Authorities.

The new units would facilitate a new pilot programme of group switching of electricity and gas customers and of group purchase among oil customers. It would be open to all residents in the Councils’ administrative area – whether a tenant or owner-occupier.

Such models have already worked well in Northern Ireland in terms of oil clubs, and there are some good examples in England where group switching has been accommodated by either the Regulator or by Local Authorities.

By grouping together, energy customers can enjoy savings from bulk purchasing and do not have to go through the tortuous ritual each year of switching energy provider just to protect themselves against big increases.

Under our proposal, a condition of participation in this scheme would be that a proportion of the savings accruing from bulk switching would have to be applied to energy efficiency improvements in people’s homes.

In this way, the Local Authority can play a very significant role in reducing the unit-cost of energy faced by residents, reducing the overall cost of energy by energy efficiency measures, and facilitating the retro-fitting of hundreds of thousands of homes in Ireland.

Other Proposals on Energy

We will heavily promote the retro-fitting of existing Local Authority Housing stock to reduce carbon emissions from this sector.

We will ensure that housing energy standards on all new developments is rigorously applied in planning conditions.

We will use all influence available to the Council to promote, facilitate and grow community micro-generation.

Bodies such as the Tipperary Energy Agency have shown the enormously positive impact communities can make. We will seek to emulate this right across the country.

We will extend the number of public charging points for electric vehicles.

"Local 2019: Workers Party","Introduction

Dublin is a difficult place for working people to live.

Growing sections of the economy revolve around low-paid insecure employment — or even bogus self-employment — while workers such as nurses, teachers, and plumbers, struggle to make ends meet. The days when most families could survive on one income are long gone. Quality of life in the city is affected not only by the pressure on wages, lack of affordable housing, and expensive childcare, but by underfunded public transport and the epidemic of dumped waste on our streets that impinges on our daily lives.

Meanwhile, the multinational takeover of Dublin city continues - our public spaces are privatised, our city turned into a conglomeration of hotels, office blocks, and overpriced student apartments. Dublin should be a living city for working class people, not the plaything of multinational tech, property, and financial corporations.

Fundamental change on the range of problems facing Irish society requires national government intervention. But there is still much that local government can do. It can choose not to sell off public land to private developers; it can build mixed income public housing; it can restart collection of household waste; it can ensure that every contractor for a public service pays at least the living wage to its employees.

But the senior council officials and establishment parties from Fine Gael to Sinn Féin won’t do it. These senior officials are enmeshed in a neoliberal framework which aims to remove the public service from providing direct public services and to outsource them to the private sector. It thus reduces both their expenditure and responsibility while increasing the prospect of profits for the private sector. The private sector is driven by the need for profit and this necessarily forces them to cut workers’ wages and skimp on the quality of service. The result is a lower quality city for everyone.

It can be different. But different results in terms of housing, waste, and public transport requires a different approach: a state-led public sector drive to directly deliver these services. Neither the corporations, the right-wing government, nor the senior council officials are interested in changing the dynamic. Change must come from the outside, from working people organising to fight for their own interest. At a political level it requires representatives who prioritise working class interests and who are not afraid to stand up to the officials to do so.

Working class interests are advanced by two equally important strategies: trade unionism and a workers’ party. Both have been under attack in recent decades and the result has been a dramatic loss in relative living standards compared to the wealthy in our society.

If the race to the bottom is to be avoided, then both need to be revitalised. The establishment media like to spread the message that all politics is corrupt, self-serving, or pointless posturing. This should be recognised for the propaganda that is: the self-serving interests of the establishment to disorganise working people from fighting for their own interests.

We offer no false promises. Local government elections are not going to change the world. But not only can they make a difference in pressurising the establishment, they are part of rebuilding the working class movement in this country, the primary agent of progressive change in modern times.

Our manifesto offers a vision of a different type of city – a Dublin that works for the great majority of people, not the wealthy elite.

We envision collective solutions – public provision of housing, waste collection, childcare, transport. We believe in democratic accountability and transparency in local government, in the place of unelected council bureaucrats. We want to fund a better future for all our citizens by introducing heavily progressive taxation at a local level.

Only a strong and principled socialist party, rooted in working class communities and trade unions, can make such a vision reality.

Democratic and Accountable Local Government

As a socialist party, the Workers' Party believes that local government must serve the public good, not private greed. We believe in democratic control of local government and we want to deliver quality public services that enhance people's lives, not shoddy services that cheat communities and benefit only the fat cats.

Instead, the local government we have today faces a variety of challenges:

Through privatisation and Ministerial control, few services are run at the most appropriate level, i.e. the local level.

So-called reforms (including merging councils) have made local government less democratic and less responsive.

The system of ‘reserved’ and ‘executive’ functions leaves the Chief Executive with a monopoly on information and the elected councillors unable to do the job they were elected to do.

Anyone living in one of the wealthiest countries in the world should be able to go to sleep knowing that in the morning the bins will be collected, there’s a local creche for their child to attend and there’s a safe park to walk through. What’s more, they should know that there’s a well-resourced local government providing these services and who to hold responsible if they don’t work.

If we want to achieve that then we must directly confront the structural factors that perpetuate the commodification of all aspects of our daily lives and offer a vision that is public and inclusive.

The developer-led planning model has meant that where profits are to be made, development has happened regardless of how appropriate it is. And where there is no profit, little or nothing has happened, regardless of need. Ultimately, our State’s reliance on private speculators for investment and corporations for delivery means those private interests hold all the cards and democracy is held hostage.

We need to recognise that the local level is often the appropriate one at which services should be organised, to disentangle those services from the web of private interests and support local government to provide them through a radically restructuring and proper funding. Then, we can create liveable communities where people can finally begin to gain control over their own lives.

Our proposals

1. Get rid of the unelected, unaccountable council Chief Executives and introduce a new ‘cabinet style’ system of local democracy
• The current system of ‘reserved’ and ‘executive’ functions should be abolished and replaced with a parliamentary model. The party or coalition with the most seats elects a cabinet comprising a mayor and vice-mayors with responsibility for the council’s various competencies. The mayor and vice-mayors would have the power to make decisions and the responsibility to be accountable for them.

2. Increased power for local authorities – including responsibility for childcare, transport, and education
• Local government must be recognised as the basic level of democratic representation. Its function is to respond to the needs of the community and so its powers should arise from the need to fulfil this role. The first step to rebuild capacity within local authorities should be to remunicipalise waste services, create a new model of community childcare and early years education, and divest all publicly-funded schools from private bodies and transfer them to a locally accountable and democratic body.

3. Neighbourhood councils to keep neighbourhood decisions close to home, and a new Dublin regional authority governing the Greater Dublin Area
• Neighbourhood or district councils should be composed of members elected by direct universal suffrage, by a system of proportional representation, and for areas of approximately 10,000 people. A parallel system of elections should elect members to a new municipal / regional council, which should comprise areas which form a coherent economic and commuting unit e.g. the Greater Dublin Area.

4. Introduce a Public Accounts Committee on every local authority to make council officials and councillors accountable for their spending

Homes for All: Public Housing on Public Land

Housing is a fundamental right. With secure and suitable housing, the rest of our lives open up - whether that means space to study, to cook, or to have the peace of mind to think about the future.

In Dublin right now there are over 10,000 people homeless. The Government admits to having over 70,0000 families on the social housing waiting list. Two full-time minimum-wage workers cannot afford to raise a family in the Dublin area without State intervention, while hotels in the capital made €47m from accommodating homeless families in 2017 alone. For homeowners the problems are different but they are no less real; Ireland’s dependence on mortgages means that any change in income levels can quickly cause an arrears crisis. And the vultures aren’t just circling, they’ve been invited in.

The problem isn’t moral failing or young people’s ‘lifestyle choices’. Contrary to the dogma of its ideologues, the private market is not up to the task of universal provision. Even before the crash it couldn’t provide, with housebuilding far exceeding demand and ghost estates left scarring the landscape.

Official government policy continues to maintain that the various private market subsidies are just short-term measures, but they continue to be the sole component of social housing provision which is growing: only one in three of the Government’s Rebuilding Ireland ‘social housing solutions’ are actually new social housing.

The Housing Assistance Payment, rent supplement and the other long-term leasing programmes show clearly how market solutions push costs onto society, never mind the stress to tenants and the additional costs of regulating them.

Sometimes it’s worthwhile stepping outside the bounds of conventional wisdom and questioning whether our current ‘normal’ is an eternal feature of society or has been created. For example, rent as a percentage of average wages has more than trebled since 1991. People want affordable housing in sustainable, inclusive communities.

The current environment is antagonistic to collective solutions because there are existing powerful interests - private landlords, property developers, banks, and vulture funds who will lose out from change. But the case for public ownership of housing is too strong. In cities like Vienna and Copenhagen, public ownership delivers affordability, quality, and security. That’s what people in Ireland want and deserve.

The Workers’ Party introduced the ‘Vienna Model’ of ‘cost-rental’ or mixed-income public housing to Ireland through our ‘Solidarity Housing’ proposal in 2016 and built on this policy framework in our recent publication Homes for All: A Public Housing Revolution.

Our ideas on mixed-income public housing are now becoming mainstream, with city council officials and right-wing parties, who once rejected them, now claiming to support them.

We will continue to fight for mixed-income public housing as the solution to the housing crisis and force the establishment parties to put their money where their mouth is.

Our proposals

1. Build Public Housing on Public Land
• End the sell-off of public land to private developers. Public land should only be used to build mixed-income public housing – rented to a mix of people, paying according to their income.
• Establish a state housing corporation to fund and construct mixed-income public housing along the lines of the Workers’ Party’s Solidarity Housing proposal. Solidarity Housing proposes a radical widening of public housing provision to cater for a greater range of households, paying according to their income.
• For all new developments, provide green space, infrastructure, and amenities, before housing is built.

2. End Landlord Rule – Rights for Renters
• Introduce leases of indefinite duration in place of the current system of Part IV tenancies (where landlords can evict tenants without reason every 4-6 years). Any new tenancy signed would only come to an end when the tenant chooses, and fixed-term leases would only be granted (by the Residential Tenancies Board) in exceptional circumstances.
• Introduce anti-eviction legislation, including ending the loopholes which allow evictions where the landlord or their family want to move in.
• Introduce a ten-year cap on current rents
• Establish a rental index setting the maximum rent for a one-bedroom property at a third of the current average wage and reducing rents for existing tenancies.
• Establish neighbourhood rental tribunals, under the auspices of the Residential Tenancies Board, where tenants can challenge unaffordable rents
• Make landlords - not tenants - pay for improvements to rental properties.
• Establish a Tenancy Protection Fund (to fund repairs where landlords refuse to do so) paid for through collecting a landlords’ income levy, and set up the Deposit Protection Scheme.

3. End ‘AirBnB’ rentals other than principal primary residences

A Public Waste Collection Service

In an era of looming climate catastrophe, the primary objectives of household waste management should be to reduce the amount of material which households dispose of to the smallest amount we can, while at the same time ensuring that as much of our disposed material as possible is recyclable.

Ireland’s system of multiple providers competing with one another to collect waste from households (‘competition within the market’) is a total failure. And for good reason:

Workers’ rights have deteriorated significantly since privatisation;

Competition and ‘choice’ are illusory where bin collection is less profitable; and

Local authorities now face higher costs in clearing dumped bags and in monitoring and prosecuting illegal dumping thanks to higher bin charges.

This system is neither environmentally sound, socially acceptable nor financially sensible.

The Government’s willful misinterpretation of the ‘polluter pays’ principle shows just how seriously they take climate change. With the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive it is the producer not the purchaser who bears the cost of recycling but whenever possible the Government forgets this model so as to defend private interests.

For example, the Government set out a suite of measures to implement the EU Waste Directives. Yet somehow only the measures which fall to households (pay-by-weight charges) have been progressed significantly since 2012. There has been no movement on having private providers reduce waste, provide food waste collection, deal with recyclables sustainably and in Ireland, or bear the cost of monitoring.

The situation is too stark to risk continuing with failed policies and failed ideologies. Private interests cause the damage so they can pay their fair share.

Environmentally sustainable capitalism is a contradiction in terms. We have succumbed to the idea that private companies are the rightful owners of all profitable enterprises no matter what the consequences.

If our objective is to ensure the protection of our environment while preserving people’s employment and their health and well-being, then the only option is a publicly-owned and publicly-provided household waste collection service.

Our proposals
1. Re-introduce a public household waste collection service, free at the point of collection.
This should be a single-collector, publicly-owned waste collection system, funded primarily through the operation of a publicly-owned recycling industry. It should include the free collection of all recyclable material for all households.

2. Transform Bord na Móna into a national recycling company, with profits from recycling used to fund the household waste collection service.
Establish a national recycling ‘centre of excellence’ under the auspices of Bord na Móna, which is run on a commercial basis and with the surplus reinvested into subsidising waste collection services. Given that it already operates a minor waste-to-energy facility and the need to transition away from peat production in a socially responsible manner, transforming Bord na Móna into a national recycling company simply makes sense. Each local authority would have shares in the new company and would be issued with a rebate proportionate to the amount of recyclable material it collects, to be reinvested into fully covering the costs of waste collection in that area.

3. Focus on the real waste producers – introduce mandatory packaging reduction measures for retailers.
It is not possible for individual households to ‘choose’ to reduce the amount of waste they produce.
Radically re-interpret the ‘producer pays’ principle to place the burden for waste reduction on the entity (almost always a profit-making company) which takes the decisions as to how to package the good and makes profit from the sale of the good,
Disband REPAK and create in its place a publicly-owned body which establishes mandatory waste reduction and packaging standards for all goods retailers, including 
○ A ban on the use of non-recyclable or non-reusable materials for packaging, 
○ The elimination of packaging for the majority of fresh produce, and,
○ Introducing a rating system for retailers and goods producers.

Introduce free public childcare

Relying on the market has directly led to the spiraling costs of childcare in Ireland. We now have the fourth-highest net cost of childcare as a percentage of family income in the OECD. For lone parents, only the US and Canada have higher childcare costs.

The cost of childcare is a huge burden on working families and parents, and often means that taking up employment is unaffordable, pushing some parents out of the workforce.

It has also meant that there is little planning – unlike at primary or secondary level, where the Department of Education and Skills uses a demographic model to assess where we will need schools now and into the future, the market model leaves us with vacancies in some areas and over-subscription in others.

And it’s not the workers who are making profits off this system. Another innovation of the market model is that it has led to low-paid, precarious employment for a skilled and almost-entirely female workforce.

Childcare and preschool matter in childhood development and they are an important factor in women’s ability to participate in the workforce and access education and training. Instead of squandering potential, let’s develop it.

Our proposals
1. Childcare and pre-school education should be viewed as part of a mainstream education system that aids a community’s development and resources.
2. Childcare services must be free at the point of service and universally accessible.
3. The system needs to be both planned and accountable. Planning and funding should be organised centrally through either the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, with local government taking responsibility though the local joint ETB/County Childcare Committee.

Unclogging Dublin: urban transport

Currently, transport sits with national government and the National Transport Authority (NTA). The effects of this on Dublin, a large city, are clear to see: Dublin is one of the slowest-moving cities in the world. The proposals below remain primarily the concern of national government. However, as city representatives, we have a role in promoting them and campaigning for them.

The high rate of car usage in cities is no accident. Since the early twentieth century, personal car ownership was regarded by corporations as one of the single biggest areas where money could be made. In cities like Los Angeles, light rail ‘streetcar’ transport systems were systematically bought up and destroyed by large motor vehicle producers, in order to create a demand for personal car ownership. The reality is, dependence on car usage for day-to-day transport benefits those corporations - but not many other people.

The clogging of Dublin’s roads is worsened by poor urban planning and the housing crisis. It should not be tolerated as ‘normal’ that people are forced to travel hours each day to their place of work. The proposals set out below should be read in conjunction with the rest of this manifesto, which aim to build cities where it is possible to work, live, bring children to care or school, and socialise with friends and family, within one vibrant, sustainable neighbourhood.

Our proposals
1. A real Rapid Bus & Tram Corridor system
• The Workers’ Party supports the development of a Rapid Bus Corridor (or equivalent light rail) system, as the primary transport mechanism for all residents not within walking and cycling distance of their destination. The current ‘BusConnects’ proposal has many benefits, however it will not function properly without modifications:
• Fully-segregated cycle lanes along the entire route
• Pre-boarding payment / tagging system, similar to the LUAS
• Single decker, multi-carriage vehicles with multiple entrances to allow for quick boarding
• The segregation of the corridor from traffic to prevent its use by drivers
• The removal of taxis from Bus Lanes. An exception to this will be taxis carrying a passenger who holds a disability parking permit, or a passenger aged 80 years or older. Taxis carrying such passengers will display a window sign for easy monitoring.

2. Free public transport - for those who ditch the car
• The Workers’ Party supports free public transport. However, we believe that, as it is introduced, it should be used as a tool to reduce car ownership across the city. Over time, this can move towards universal free public transport. We support the extension of the free travel pass to all one-parent households, and free public transport for all adults who do not own a car, and their under-18 dependents.

3. Public money for public solutions - not private subsidies
• No private corporate involvement in public transport. All routes should be funded publicly - not through costly PPPs - and run by state-owned companies with trade union representation on the management and board.
• An end to subsidies for electric cars, which only benefits those who can afford costly vehicles. Public financing should be used to fund transport options which are equally available to all. Tax breaks and subsidies for expensive consumer goods benefit the wealthy disproportionately. As a principle, our transport system should be built up through public investment in infrastructure, education, and ending harmful practices - not tax breaks. Tax breaks as incentives are right-wing policy tools which reduce the public budget, and favour the wealthy.

4. Create space for non-car transport 
• All the investment in the world will not change the fact that there is only limited space on our roads and, currently, they are at capacity. It is not credible to support increases in buses and trams, without supporting a reduction in the numbers of cars on our roads - whether driving or parked. We support:
• A dedicated Public Transport bus lane on the M50, for orbital routes operating on an expanded public bus network
• The gradual introduction of a car-free zone from Parnell Sq to Grafton St, Capel St to Gardiner St, and George’s St to Westland Row, with permits for those with mobility limits. This could be trialled with ‘Car Free Sundays.’
• Wherever necessary, the removal of on-street city centre parking to make way for segregated bicycle lanes.
• An urban congestion charge.

5. Make Dublin pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly 
• As well as the high profile – and expensive – infrastructure development, there are plenty of inexpensive measures that can make Dublin a better city for pedestrians and cyclists. These include:
• Ensuring pedestrian crossings have timing schedules which favour pedestrians
• The removal of the vast majority of bollards taking up pedestrian space
• Moving street furniture relating to car parking and road traffic (meters, signs) onto the road (through the removal of parking spaces). Why should pedestrian space be sacrificed?
• The removal of commercial advertising sandwich boards from public property
• The introduction within the city council’s planning department of a ‘school transport liaison officer,’ with responsibility for working with schools to make small changes that help more children walk and cycle to school.

4. Dramatically reduce commercial road traffic

• Commercial road traffic - HGVs, delivery vans - has a very detrimental effect on quality of life in urban centres. It adds enormously to congestion, road damage and noise. We propose the establishment of a national haulage company, with decent, unionised employment, responsible for considering how to reduce the impact of freight, delivery, construction and heavy goods vehicles in our cities. In Dublin, one initial project should be the establishment of freight trains on the LUAS system, something already in operation in Dresden and St. Éitienne.

Tax corporations and landlords to fund public services

In the EU-15 countries, grants from central government account for a little over half of all government spending. In Ireland it’s 95%. Unless we change this, increases in local government responsibility would be meaningless as they would have very little ability to actually do anything.

One of the present sources of revenue for local government is taxes and tariffs. Commercial rates should be a significant source of income but as of 2016 local authorities were owed €340m in unpaid rates. Another source of funding is the Local Property Tax. At present, 80% is retained in the local authority and the remaining 20% redistributed to other areas with lower tax bases. This is a completely blunt tax that pays no heed to ability to pay and should be abolished.

In Austria, however, around 90% of the revenue of municipalities and states comes from shared federal government taxes. This ensures continuity from year to year. Tax revenues are distributed to each individual state based on population, combined with a fixed ratio, rather than by the local revenue base. States and municipalities also levy their own taxes (e.g. on property, second homes, pets, tourism, etc.). The states also have access to the Austrian Federal Financing Agency.

Funding from central government needs to be combined with new revenue raising capacities for local government. These new taxes should be aimed at the wealthiest sections of society. In Dublin, we want to introduce new taxation measures aimed at the giant corporations, developers, and landlords, who make huge profits from our city, using our infrastructure and our people, but don’t pay an adequate share of tax, if any at all.

Local government should also engage in commercial activities, including waste services, gardening and landscaping services, building and development, training on energy management, recruitment, and health and safety.

Our proposals

1.) Local government should be funded in part through a block grant from the Exchequer.

• This should be primarily funded through ring-fenced taxes that impact on local areas (betting, alcohol, tobacco, emissions, plastic bags, etc.), collected by the Revenue Commissioners and distributed based on population and need.

2.) However, and to ensure an element of political independence from central government, efforts should be made to identify autonomous sources of
funding also. These should be aimed primarily at the corporations, developers, and landlords who profit from our city but don’t pay their way.

These new taxes and revenue raising measures could include:

A ‘Landlord’s tax’ in which large landlords owning 2+ properties pay commercial rates on those properties

The elimination of rebates on commercial rates for owners of vacant commercial properties and the enforcement of the charge of interest on non-payment of commercial rates (as currently provided by law).A local income tax for those earning €70,000+, feasible now that the property tax is collected by Revenue

A local corporation tax, in which corporations with a turnover above a certain defined threshold

A mansion transaction tax, levied as a percentage of the sale of homes sold at above €1million, or office and commercial space above an agreed defined threshold

A bed tax, payable by tourists staying in hotels, has the potential to raise €100 million nationally, with most of that revenue in Dublin, if levied at a rate of €5 / night - typical in other European capital cities.

"EP 2014: Fianna Fail","Introduction
Fianna Fáil is committed to a stronger, simpler and more democratic European Union. We believe that the EU must pursue policies which promote growth, jobs, equality and fairness for all citizens.

Since Ireland applied for membership under former Taoiseach Seán Lemass, Fianna Fáil has been a pro-European party. As a member party of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), Fianna Fáil will continue to be a strong voice for Irish citizens in the European Parliament.

We have a very strong team of candidates that are committed, experienced and constructive. Our candidates will give Irish citizens strong representation in the European Parliament, tackling the issues that affect them and shaping European legislation that reflects the concerns of our communities.

As the European Parliament is the only directly elected European body of the European Union, the policies it produces must deliver for every Irish citizen.

We are five years into the biggest crisis since the Union was founded. A financial crisis became an economic one which has hit many millions of citizens throughout the EU. Fianna Fáil wants the world to have confidence in the Eurozone Financial System and we want our single currency to have a genuine banking union.

The European Union must focus more on creating jobs and growing the economy. We believe that Quantitative Easing (QE) is the correct response to low growth and threatened inflation.

Europe needs to start offering workable solutions to the challenges we face instead of compounding them.

Fianna Fáil in the European Parliament will continue to fight for a better EU which serves its citizens. We will be a constructive voice for the Irish people on the issues which matter to them.

Ending the Eurozone Crisis
Separate Sovereign and Banking Debt

Fianna Fáil believes that the EU must fulfil its commitment to separate sovereign debt and banking debt within the Union. European leaders agreed in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt.

This is the most crucial issue for the Irish people and its economy. Ireland and Europe’s recovery will be much, much slower if this is not done. Unemployment will remain high and consumer confidence across the EU will remain too low.

The Irish people need to know that the 2012 agreement stands and will be acted upon in good faith and in solidarity.

There needs to be action on retroactively recapitalising Irish banks and recognising the unfair burden Ireland took at the beginning of the financial crisis.

Everyone now acknowledges that the structure of the Eurozone as a currency union was flawed and impeded countries who tried to combat the Eurozone crisis at the beginning. There was no European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in place until July 2013.

Create a Fiscal and Transfer Union

The EU needs to recognise the mistakes of the past and the errors that were made. Fianna Fáil believes there should be a more ambitious fiscal union within the EU. In particular, one which involves transfers between states and allows the Union some modest revenue rising capacity in order to balance the economic equilibrium of the EU.

Banking Union
Fianna Fáil believes that a fully functioning banking union must include common regulation, common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism. Without these elements, a fully functioning banking union will not be achieved. The EU operates in a single market for goods and services. It makes sense for a full banking union with a strong regulatory system to operate within that market.

Therefore we welcome the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism by November 2014 and the agreement on the single resolution mechanism, which will become operational in January 2015.

Banking Regulations
In order to achieve financial stability within the EU it is necessary to have soundly regulated and safe financial institutions. Fianna Fáil believes now is the time to establish a common framework ensuring prudential oversight and consumer protection all over the European internal market. The new EU regulator must be well resourced, have strong dissuasive sanctions and clear enforcement mechanisms in order to ensure that the banking crisis which we are only now recovering from, never happens again.

European Banking Salary Caps
Fianna Fáil is in favour of a pay structure at a European level for senior bank staff that discourages reckless and speculative ventures. Bonuses to senior executives should be structured such that they can be rescinded if a financial institution incurs significant losses in subsequent years as a result of actions which initially led to short term profits.

EU Focus on Jobs
Deepening the EU Single Market

Fianna Fáil believes in the power and success of the European single market, which has laid the foundation for thousands of new jobs in Ireland.

We will prioritise the completion and expansion of the single market. Europe must complete the market in services, and must identify and create new opportunities for economic growth and greater innovation. These measures will boost Ireland’s competitiveness.

Defending our Corporation Tax
Fianna Fáil will continue the fight to maintain Ireland’s control over our Corporation Tax rate. National taxation rates are a national competency in the EU. We will fight to ensure that this remains the case. We are committed to the principle of tax competition. We are convinced that we need to do more to fight tax avoidance and evasion.

We welcome any progress made on international tax agreements and believe that the Irish government should cooperate fully with these talks.

The establishment of a favourable financial framework to encourage the setting up of new businesses in Ireland and Europe is a key priority and one which is central to boosting investment in Ireland and Europe.

Youth Guarantee
Fianna Fáil believes that our young people have been affected disproportionately in the current economic crisis. We support the swift and effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee scheme in Ireland. The Youth Guarantee scheme must offer high quality, properly structured work experience for young unemployed people. This Scheme must develop the skills and talents of our young population and enable them to gain long term full time employment on completion.

The EU must assist governments more to ensure that all young people under 25 whether registered with employment services or not – get a good-quality, concrete offer within 4 months of their leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. We believe the Finnish model is the correct model to follow in this regard which links the education, skills and interests of the young person to a well-structured, high quality internship.

Europe and European leaders need to do more to address the employment problems facing our young people. The Youth Guarantee Scheme and internship programmes can only be effective if they are balanced with the creation of sustainable employment opportunities and targeted job creation programmes under the European Social Fund.

Infrastructure Investment
Further investment at an EU level is needed to fully integrate all regions of Europe in order to ensure all citizens benefit from the single market. Fianna Fáil fully supports European Investment Bank lending for Irish infrastructure projects and believe more funding should be sought for strategic national infrastructure projects such as the DART Underground Project and the Western Arc Project.

Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership

Fianna Fáil fully supports the successful conclusion of the EU-US free trade agreement. This agreement could boost the European economy by over €100 billion annually.

However, we will ensure that Ireland’s interests in agriculture and the agri-food sector are defended in the negotiations of this deal.

Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

Fianna Fáil understands that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) drive prosperity in Ireland and in Europe. Our MEPs will work to facilitate the creation of more jobs through easier access to finance, simpler rules for investment funds and increased market access to support new, innovative businesses across Ireland and Europe, and opportunities for young entrepreneurs.

We will prioritise cutting red tape for SMEs, simplifying access to EU funds for SMEs and ensuring that Irish SMEs benefit more from EU structural funds.

An EU of Innovation

Promoting the Digital Economy
Fianna Fáil will work to create a modern economy that simplifies life through more e-services, and stimulates e-commerce by improving faster internet access, expanding broadband access in rural areas and creating a genuine single market in telecommunications.

Given that all roaming costs are to be abolished in the European Union by December 2015, Fianna Fáil will work to ensure that customers will not be unfairly penalised for domestic calls by providers seeking to recoup costs.

A Single European Sky
Fianna Fáil supports the plan to create a Single European Sky which will see the design, management and regulation of airspace in Europe coordinated throughout the European Union. The Single European Sky will reduce costs to air passengers, reduce journey times within the EU and reduce the environmental impact that air travel has on our environment.

Horizon 2020
Fianna Fáil believes that the Government needs to ensure that Ireland benefits fully from the Horizon 2020 programme. This is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020). The public and private sector must work together in order to seek Horizon 2020 funding and guarantee smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs for Ireland in the future.

Agriculture: Sustaining the Family Farm

Preserving CAP
Fianna Fáil will continue to fight for European farming policies which will deliver a fair return for fair work to all farmers and ensure sustainable, vibrant and viable rural communities.

The Common Agricultural Policy has played a vital role in keeping the agricultural heartbeat of rural Ireland beating, preserving the countryside across the continent, and providing high quality, low cost produce to the European consumer.

The new CAP deal, due to come in place in 2015 marks the first budget reduction for the policy in its history. With a smaller budget we must ensure that programmes are targeted at the farmers who deliver high quality produce and public goods to the highest environmental, health and safety standards.

Empowering all Farmers
Fine Gael’s preoccupation during the CAP negotiations appears to have been focussed on preserving the interests of a small number of farmers in receipt of large grants based on historical circumstances. Fianna Fáil believes in a CAP package that would sustain as many family farms as is practicable and empower all farmers with the opportunity to improve their holdings. Separately, we have published detailed proposals on implementing the CAP package.

Future of Irish Agriculture
Currently, exports for the Irish agri-food sector are worth close to €10 billion and there is significant scope for growth here as new and emerging markets are targeted.

Fianna Fáil MEPs will ensure that the interests of this sector are promoted and protected in all EU trade negotiations and deals.

The future of Irish agriculture and the agri-food sector needs Europe to take a serious approach to ensure a fair price for farmers from both multiples and processors.

If we want to sustain farming into the future and meet the targets of Harvest 2020, farmers must be able to receive a fair price for their produce.

Fianna Fáil is also calling for EU legislation to ensure small food producers are paid within 30 days of the sale of goods in order to ensure the sustainability of the small scale food production industry.

Implementation and future reviews of the CAP agreement should have considerable social and economic implications meaning the purpose of farming is to maintain the family farm at the heart of European agriculture and to ensure that all farmers, no matter where they are from and irrespective of the size and type of land, will receive a fair return from agriculture.

Fisheries
Fianna Fáil has welcomed the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund agreement which contains a new scheme for young fishermen under the age of 40. This scheme offers new funding for small ports affected by a decline in fish landings to allow for diversification and funding for quality and safety initiatives. The provision of seed capital in this fund is clearly required to allow smaller ports to diversify into new economic activities.

This fund will help build on the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy within the EU. Fianna Fáil will continue to seek fisheries policy at an EU level which focuses on maintaining employment in the fisheries sector and in peripheral coastal communities dependent on fisheries.

An Equal Europe

Sharing our Health Services
The European Union is a world leader in health service provision. Fianna Fáil believes that there is huge potential in the sharing of expertise and research in the health care sector on a European level. We also believe that services provided by Member States should, in principle, be accessible to all citizens of the European Union. Shared health services across the borders of Europe would reduce inefficiencies and provide a better coverage of services for all our citizens.

Three and a half million Europeans will die from smoking related diseases during the term of the next parliament and more than €100 billion will be spent treating the effects. These are horrifying facts and we must face up to them. Fianna Fáil welcomes the passing of the new directive earlier this year but more needs to be done. Ireland needs to be at the forefront of that and be a strong anti-tobacco voice in Europe.

Building on the new EU Youth, Education and Sport Programme - Erasmus+

The new Erasmus+ programme aims to boost skills and employability, as well as modernising Education, Training, and Youth work. The new programme has a budget of €14.7 billion; a 40% increase compared to previous budgets.

Fianna Fáil will work to ensure that the benefits of this new programme will be realised by Irish students, youth organisations and those involved in lifelong learning.

Sport
Under the Erasmus+ Programme sport benefit from programmes to develop transfer, and implement innovative ideas and practices at European, national, regional, and local level with cross border cooperation.

We will ensure that the opportunity is taken to utilise this new programme and budget to support grassroots projects and address cross-border challenges such as combating match-fixing, doping, violence and racism.

Promoting Equality

Fianna Fáil believes that the best way of promoting equality in the EU is by guaranteeing the right to education for all. The EU should also seek to secure, in particular, the rights of women to be treated equally across the world. The EU should ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.

European Social Fund - Building Stronger Communities
The European Social Fund is Europe’s main instrument for employment promotion and supporting the most vulnerable in our society. With an overall budget of €80 billion this Fund will play a crucial role in the 2014 - 2020 programming period in terms of ensuring quality jobs for Irish citizens, supporting solutions to address social, employment and educational needs.

Fianna Fáil’s aim is to ensure that the actions of this Fund are supported by and accessible to local authorities, social partners and NGOs in order to bring the benefits of this Programme to the widest number of Irish citizens.

The allocation of at least 20% of the Fund to social inclusion will mean that people in difficulties and those from disadvantaged groups will get more support to have the same opportunities as others to integrate into society. With an estimated 5,000 people homeless in Ireland at any one time, the gaps in society must be closed with target measures in Ireland on poverty and social exclusion.

Ireland also has access to additional funding under the Youth Employment Initiative. The priority for Fianna Fáil MEPs is to ensure that Ireland effectively and efficiently utilises this Fund to assist young people to enter the labour market with meaningful and sustainable employment opportunities.

Reforming the EU
Restore the fairness and equality of the Community Method of Decision Making

Fianna Fáil believes the EU must rebalance the institutional powers of the EU back in favour of the European Commission and Parliament and away from the intergovernmental approach which has become increasingly prominent in recent years.

The European Commission as the guardian of the EU Treaties and the common European interest, including protection of the interests of smaller EU Member States, must be restored as the guiding force in European affairs. The influence of Germany and France throughout the EU must be balanced by a strong European Commission which represents all interests of the Union.

Fianna Fáil will continue to fight to retain Ireland’s seat at the Commission table. In order to hold an EU wide view in decision making, it is important that every Member State has equal representation at the European Commission table.

Rebuilding the EMU

Fianna Fáil also calls for a re-examination of the structures of the Economic and Monetary Union as well as the mandate of the European Central Bank. The architecture to ensure the long term sustainability of the Eurozone is still absent.

This must be corrected and provide a basis for the future prosperity of the Union. The ECB’s mandate must require policies for targeted growth as well as targeting inflation.

A Single Location for the European Parliament
Fianna Fáil is committed to making better use of your money by continuing to cut administrative budgets and lead the fight for a single location for the European Parliament.

It is not acceptable that that the European Parliament currently operates from three cities in three different countries adding hundreds of millions of euro to your tax bill every year.

We will fight to end this expensive practice.

Spending Accountability
The error rate on EU budget spending was almost 5% in 2012 according to the annual report by the European Court of Auditors, published in November 2013.

Member States are still not doing enough to protect the 80% of EU funds that they manage.

Fianna Fáil wants to streamline and simplify EU rules so that they are more transparent, easier to apply and enforce in order to avoid waste and error. More needs to be done to protect taxpayers’ money being misspent by both Member States and the European Union.

We will call for increased accountability and transparency in all budgetary issues and for an audit of all existing EU agencies. Those that do not deliver significant added value should be abolished.

A More Democratic EU
Fianna Fáil supports a reinforcement of the democratic nature of the European Union, with a greater involvement of the European and national parliaments in decisionmaking, and with greater transparency of negotiations and voting within the Council of European Union.

Seanad Éireann should be given a stronger role in scrutinising EU legislation and should take a lead role in policing the subsidiarity principle of the EU.

Lobbying Regulations
The EU institutions pass legislation which affects over 500 million people in Europe every year. Fianna Fáil believes that in order to ensure the integrity of this legislation, strong regulation of lobbyists must be enacted at an EU level similar to regulations which currently exist in the United States. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) must be given full powers to investigate decisions of EU institutions and their actions. Further wide ranging powers and extensive resources should be considered for OLAF.

Europe’s Role in the World

Enlargement

Fianna Fáil believes that the EU’s Enlargement policy is one of the most effective foreign policy tools the Union has at its disposal.

However, our Party believes that it is important to bed down the new EU legislative structures introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon and throughout the ongoing building of economic stability in the EU before any further enlargement occurs.

As the Union decides on how best to face the future, neighbouring countries should be accommodated through the use of Partnerships which accord increasing bilateral relations between the EU and the third-party country but does not result in full membership of the EU in the short term.

Promoting Human Rights

Promoting and protecting universal human rights must be at the heart of Europe’s foreign policy. This must be reflected in all aspects of EU policy including in trade negotiations.

Ireland must use its influence within the EU to raise and promote the improvement of human rights across the world.

EU Aid Volunteers
Fianna Fáil fully supports the EU Aid Volunteers initiative. This volunteer group will provide a path for Europeans eager to help the victims of crises and disasters. It will provide technical assistance, helping people outside the EU to understand European culture, and helping EU citizens to understand the cultures of other countries. The volunteers’ work would relate to social and economic development.

Middle East
Fianna Fáil believes the EU should continue to support any efforts to achieve a two state solution in the conflict between Israel and Palestine.

We are deeply concerned at the continuing advance of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory which are both illegal and make the two-state solution increasingly unlikely.

The EU should seek to ban all Israeli settlement goods from the EU’s internal market.

The EU should also press for Palestine to become a party of the International Criminal Court.

Fighting Climate Change
Fianna Fáil believes that Europe must lead in the fight against climate change.

We must ensure that the EU supports sustainable, sensible and renewable energy policies at a European level. The EU must also ensure that our international partners keep their commitments to reduce the causes of climate change internationally. Fianna Fáil fully supports plans to integrate our national grid into the European energy market in order to secure our energy supply.

Fianna Fáil will support policies which reduce European dependency on outside energy resources. The EU must pursue policies which increase energy security and stability within the Union. We need a European energy policy which shields Europe from destabilising external political actors who use energy resources as a political tool.

"EP 2014: Fine Gael","Foreword by AN TAOISEACH

The last few years have been very tough for the Irish people. You have made sacrifices to pull Ireland back from the brink. We are on the road to recovery now but we must work hard to make sure this recovery is sustainable, fair and felt in homes throughout the country. That is why your upcoming decision on the people you send to Europe to represent you, to take decisions in your name, is so important.

We have moved from a crisis where 250,000 jobs were lost in the three years before the Fine Gael-led Government came to office, to a more stable and positive economic outlook where almost 61,000 jobs were created last year. We want to build on that stability to ensure we continue to grow and create jobs so that our people have the opportunity to work and make a good life for themselves and their families here in Ireland.

Your vote in the upcoming European Parliament elections on 23rd May is vital to continuing on the path to recovery. Fine Gael, as a member of the biggest political grouping in Europe - the European People’s Party (EPP) - is putting forward candidates of exceptional ability and years of experience at all levels. This will ensure that Ireland stays at the heart of Europe, close to the decision-makers with real influence, and well-represented within the EU.

We need your support to give Ireland the best chance for a strong, sustainable recovery and a better future for all of our people.

Introduction by Minister for European Affairs

Your vote in the European Parliament elections is now more important than ever. This is because, under the Lisbon Treaty, the Parliament now has new law-making powers that apply to more than 40 areas. These include agriculture, energy policy, immigration and use of EU funds.

This enhanced power is already being felt through the impact your Fine Gael MEPs have had on recent decisions, such as the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). They have also had a strong say in the design of the new banking union; the aim of which is to prevent an economic crisis like the one we have just experienced ever happening again.

As the only directly-elected EU body, the European Parliament is the European institution that is most directly accountable to you, the voter. Your Fine Gael MEPs are best placed to make your voice heard in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg on the laws and decisions that affect us all.

Fine Gael MEPs are members of the European People’s Party (EPP), the largest political grouping in the European Parliament. Twelve of the EU twenty eight Member States’ Heads of State and Government belong to the EPP and have played a key role in leading the European economy out of crisis and into recovery.

Fine Gael MEPs, together with their EPP colleagues, are now setting the agenda for recovery by securing stability within the economy and focusing on driving growth and job creation in Europe. A vote for a Fine Gael candidate in the European Elections is a vote for the policies of recovery. As members of the EPP, a vote for Fine Gael puts power in your hands. Our people must be able to look to the future with hope and optimism. A vote for Fine Gael will deliver a stronger, brighter and more secure Ireland, working towards prosperity within Europe.

1. DRIVING RECOVERY THROUGH STABILITY, GROWTH & JOBS

At the time of the last European Parliament elections, the Irish economy was in free-fall. The Irish people elected politicians that would act responsibly to bring the country back from the brink of ruin to growth. They did so by making Fine Gael the largest group of Irish MEPs.

This decision proved important when the European economy, and the Eurozone, faced massive challenges. The European Parliament played an important role in supporting our common currency and the European financial system. What’s more, Fine Gael MEPs, along with their colleagues in the EPP, played a crucial role in introducing a series of vital reforms that will ensure that both the euro and the EU financial system safeguard future growth and stability.

As a small open economy, Ireland’s future growth is heavily dependent on what happens in Europe. We have been making real progress in terms of rebuilding our reputation abroad. We are successfully delivering the message that Ireland is a good place in which to do business. But the job is not complete.

By targeting the areas with real potential for growth, such as agriculture, the digital sector, tourism and manufacturing, we are now experiencing the fastest pace of jobs growth in Europe. Investment in Ireland from the European Investment Bank has increased by four fifths compared to 2010. This is crucial to our ability to create the jobs we so badly need.

JOBS

Tackling Youth Unemployment 
Fine Gael recognises that the Government and the European Union has a responsibility to ensure that each and every person in our society is given an opportunity to play a role in our economic recovery.

We believe that the single biggest crisis facing the European Union is youth unemployment. Our European leaders must make decisions that will help the single market rise to its potential and create the kind of jobs that our young people can fill. We no longer want to see our young talented people being forced to leave our shores or become dependent on the State’s welfare supports.

We also recognise the real dangers of our young becoming long-term unemployed. The €6 billion EU Youth Guarantee, agreed under the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU, will ensure that young people who are unemployed are guaranteed a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or training.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work with the Irish Government to ensure the implementation of an effective and well-resourced Youth Guarantee in Ireland.
• Work at EU level to ensure that best practice is disseminated across the EU so that the benefit of the Youth Guarantee is felt evenly and fairly across the Member States. We all stand to gain from getting our young people back to work.

Investing in Research and Innovation 
In the most recent European Commission Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in March 2014, Ireland increased its position from tenth to ninth in the overall ranking of 28 EU Member States and was the overall leader in the indicator of the economic effects of innovation. We will build on this success.

Horizon 2020 is the biggest ever European Research and Innovation Programme and the largest worldwide, with a budget of almost €80 billion covering the next seven years. The Government has set an ambitious but achievable target for Irish researchers, of winning funding of €1.25 billion over the lifetime of Horizon 2020. Fine Gael MEPs will work to ensure that Ireland maximises the potential of the EU-wide budget.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Support the establishment of common research programmes between top universities and research organisations.
• Campaign for a European framework for education standards and greater cooperation in research across Europe to maximise investment in future jobs and growth.

Encouraging additional investment in infrastructure through the European Investment Bank and job creation through balanced regional development.

In the last two years, Ireland has increasingly benefitted from the availability of capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The EIB has provided loans for the Grangegorman Public Private Partnership (PPP), Dublin Cross City Luas Project and upgrade works on the N11/N7 Motorway. The EIB is now more important than ever in the context of maximising infrastructural investment in Ireland. Fine Gael recognises the invaluable role it can play in helping to develop projects of social value and as a driver of job creation. In total, the EIB provided €1.193 billion in assistance to Ireland in 2013, a 21% increase over 2012. We recognise the need to encourage additional investment and to ensure job and growth potential is delivered through balanced regional development.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work with their EPP colleagues towards improving the role of the EIB to facilitate easier access to capital, especially for SMEs.
• Ensure that procedures are streamlined to allow businesses across Ireland to compete for EU funded projects.
• Focus on directing structural funds to the areas most in need.

STABILITY

Establishing a fair and sustainable financial system to support growth 
In Europe, the Fine Gael MEPs have been able to harness their position in the EPP Group to influence policymakers at every level throughout the crisis. They have spoken up for Ireland when it mattered, for example, through their work on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

What happens next though is critical. Ensuring that the tools are in place to prevent a repeat of the crisis we have just been through is vital. The work our MEPs do to facilitate the delivery of a robust banking union, a satisfactory supervisory mechanism and a workable single resolution mechanism, will also impact all of our lives for years to come. Sending our best to Europe is a must.

The new financial arrangements Europe has agreed will ensure taxpayers will not have to pay for banks’ mistakes again. This will be done through a ‘bail-in’ mechanism whereby banks’ shareholders and creditors have to pay their share.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to address Ireland’s legacy bank debt, building on the Eurogroup ESM framework for recapitalising European banks, including the potential retroactive recapitalisation of our banks.

Lowering bank lending rates to Irish businesses to German levels through the acceleration of banking union We have to regain confidence in our banking sector and ensure that our banks are working to serve the people, not the other way around. Encouraging small and medium enterprises to look for credit when they need it, and ensuring that the banks can deliver this credit, is central to the future growth of our domestic economy.

At present, the euro area banking system is fragmented along national lines. Irish SMEs and consumers are effectively reliant on domestic sources of funding. This has led to imbalances across the European banking system where SMEs and consumers are not able to access the affordable interest rates that they need. Under banking union, the cost of bank finance to SMEs and households should converge to the euro area average. This could result in a lowering of lending rates of up to 2%.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work with their EPP colleagues to ensure implementation of the new European banking union banking system.
• Ensure that European banking union will not only provide a safeguard against future crises but also provide a more competitive and flexible system for both SMEs and consumers.

Continued reform of the Single Market to encourage growth Reform of the European banking and financial sector necessarily took precedence during the years of the financial crisis but we believe that strengthening the Single Market is now just as important. Removing remaining barriers that reduce the free movement of persons, capital, goods and services across the EU can create a new wave of growth among our SMEs and young entrepreneurs. In particular, Fine Gael believes Ireland, as a European hub for digital innovation, is uniquely placed to maximise the potential of the Digital Single Market.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work with our EPP colleagues on breaking down the remaining barriers in the Single Market and resist calls for more protectionism, which would ultimately cost Europeans and our trading partners, particularly in the developing world.

Swifter action to open up EU markets for Irish exporters of services and digital content Fine Gael believes in a Digital Single Market (DSM) for Europe. This will benefit consumers and open up EU markets for Irish exports of services and digital content. Your Fine Gael MEPs have been working on initiatives such as the Connecting Europe Facility, which helps finance the rollout of high speed broadband across Europe. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter TD, is also working to ensure that the new EU Data Protection Regulation allows people to have more control over their personal data while supporting current and new digital businesses.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to advance the Digital Single Market by removing the legal and fiscal barriers SMEs face to trading online, by creating common rules for cross-border situations and a new simplified VAT system.
• Work towards an integrated online and mobile payments market to support Irish digital companies. Fine Gael believes Irish exporters are uniquely placed to benefit from the DSM, given the dynamic nature of our digital and ICT sectors.

GROWTH

Cementing Ireland’s position as a hub for transatlantic trade and investment through completing the transatlantic free trade area In the final month of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, Richard Bruton TD, secured agreement among EU Trade Ministers to start negotiations between the EU and the US on a new trade deal. The proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be hugely important for Ireland as the US is one of Ireland’s biggest trading partners. American companies had investments worth over $200 billion in Ireland in 2012 and Ireland exported over €26 billion to the US.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to secure the delivery of the TTIP agreement and to ensure that Ireland is well placed to fully benefit from any deal.

Cutting red-tape imposed on small businesses from European legislation Fine Gael recognises that small and medium enterprises can be frustrated by overly burdensome red-tape. The EU is often seen as the first culprit for unnecessary or cumbersome regulation.

Ireland is among the countries leading the charge for ‘better’ and ‘smarter’ regulation in demanding that EU regulations are efficient, proportionate and do not impose an undue burden on Irish businesses. From 2007-2012, Europe successfully reduced the red tape it imposes on small businesses by over 25%. It is a significant achievement that the European Commission now applies a ‘think small first’ approach when designing policy (SMEs’ interests are taken into account at the very early stages of policy making).

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Build on this progress and ensure that the EU institutions set themselves ambitious targets for administrative burden reduction.
• Implement further reductions in red tape, simpler rules and subsidiarity (the EU will only intervene where action by individual countries is insufficient).
• Work to create a Vice President of the Commission who is given the task of ‘red tape watchdog’ to continuously scrutinise EU legislation.

Enabling our Agriculture Sector to thrive domestically and internationally 

Fine Gael in government has strategically prioritised the agri-food and marine sectors. Since taking office in 2011, agrifood exports have increased by 21% and the sector is well on track to meeting the €12 billion target set out in Food Harvest 2020.

Fine Gael played a key leadership role in Europe in finalising the CAP negotiations through the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU and through our strong presence in the European Parliament. The new CAP is an investment in rural communities and will provide the basis for job creation and export driven expansion in the agri-food sector. This will provide sustainable employment in rural communities across the country.

Through the vital work of Fine Gael MEPs, working alongside the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Simon Coveney TD, Ireland successfully agreed its preferred model of payment supports, which delivers a fair outcome for all farmers. Our MEPs are very conscious of the need to sustain the agriculture industry in Ireland, particularly among more economically vulnerable farmers and this is reflected in the reformed CAP. EU food security and climate change policy measures will be key to ensuring that Member States such as Ireland have room to expand production, in a low carbon, environmentally sustainable way.

Fine Gael is investing in the future of the agricultural industry, recognising the need to attract young farmers, the importance of continued research and innovation and the necessity to grow the sector in an environmentally sustainable way. One of Fine Gael’s key achievements under CAP reform was the introduction of very significant extra supports for young farmers to support generational change.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to develop the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) model to link research and innovation to farm practice.
• Promote the expansion of exports in an environmentally sustainable and ‘green’ way.

2. SUPPORTING A FAIRER, GREENER, HEALTHIER IRELAND

A FAIRER IRELAND

The four fundamental freedoms of the EU: free movement of goods, services, capital and people, has allowed the continent and its citizens to prosper in the post-World War II era. Much of Ireland’s rights-based legislation has its origins in Europe and Irish MEPs and Ministers continue to play a strong role in advancing the equality and rights agenda within the institutions of the EU.

For Fine Gael, human rights and fairness are values of central importance. When we entered government in 2011, Fine Gael set about addressing the serious inequalities that persist for many sectors of society, including women, children, same-sex couples and those seeking asylum.

While many of these areas are matters of national competence, the European Union offers a framework for fundamental human rights which must be implemented. This presents us with an opportunity to work alongside other Member States to come up with shared solutions to common problems. The people of the European Union value individual freedoms and democratic rights. We need to work together to build on these shared values.

Gender Equality and Victims’ Rights Recognising that the glass ceiling continues to be an unfair barrier for Irish women, Fine Gael in government has taken steps to address gender inequality. Just 15% of the current Dáil is made up of female TDs. However, legislation has been introduced to provide for gender quotas at the next General Election. The Programme for Government commits to a target of at least 40% representation of both genders on State boards and steady progress is being made in achieving this goal.

Within the EU in 2013 only 17.6% of non-executive directors were women and proposals for a directive to address this imbalance were approved by the Parliament last year; work remains to be done to bring the directive to fruition.

Combatting violence against women is a priority for Fine Gael. Important steps have and will continue to be taken to improve the rights of victims in the EU. The Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU secured agreement on a civil European Protection Order measure which means that a civil protection order, such as a barring order for domestic violence, can still be enforced if the victim travels, or moves, from one EU Member State to another.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to ensure the prompt implementation of the European Parliament’s 2013 decision to introduce mandatory gender quotas providing for 40% female representation on circa 5,000 listed medium and large-sized companies in the EU by 2020 and State-owned companies by 2018.
• Seek the introduction of stronger measures to combat domestic violence, which disproportionately affects women.
• Work to address barriers to female employment and professional progression, including childcare.

Disability There are over 1.3 million children and young adults with disabilities living in institutional care in Europe. Fine Gael recognises the need to provide these most vulnerable, voiceless children and young adults with appropriate community- based living.

Fine Gael MEPs in the European Parliament have actively supported the agencies that work in EU Member States to achieve de-institutionalisation. Fine Gael MEPs have campaigned to ensure that EU structural funds will be spent on enabling people with disabilities in the EU to live in community-based care and not in institutional care. Fine Gael strongly supports the EU’s disability strategy as set out in the ‘European Disability Strategy 2010-2020’.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to ensure that the commitments in the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 are given effect.
• Advance proposals for a Disability Commissioner.
• Continue to campaign for an end to the institutionalisation of children with disabilities in Europe and the prioritisation of community care.

Advancing Human Rights and Equality 

Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU concluded negotiations on the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. This constitutes a major step forward in the development of human rights in Europe, ensuring that Member States offer the highest standard of human rights protections to their citizens. Furthermore, during the Irish Presidency, Minister Shatter prioritised enhancing fundamental rights and protecting the rule of law, securing agreement that further consideration would be given to safeguarding fundamental rights and countering extreme forms of intolerance, such as racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia. Work is ongoing to develop rule of law indicators focussed on a number of fundamental rights to ensure the protection of these rights for EU citizens.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Ensure the development and implementation of the framework for addressing threats to the rule of law in the 28 Member States in areas including racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and homophobia.
• Vocally oppose regressive legislation affecting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, promoting and protecting the human rights of all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

Consumer Rights 

The EU, working with national Governments, has defined and protected a broad range of consumer rights over the last fifty years in areas such as product safety and consumer law. The new Consumer Rights Directive has strengthened consumer rights, particularly in the area of online contracts. These protections greatly enhance the rights of citizens in the EU in their own Member States and across borders within the EU. Fine Gael MEPs will ensure that consumer rights remain a cornerstone of the work of the European Parliament.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Prioritise legislation in the five sectors identified in the European Consumer Agenda: Food; Energy; Financial; Transport and Digital.
• Work to strengthen the regulatory framework protecting consumer safety in the areas of goods, services and food.
• Promote more efficient and effective market surveillance and law enforcement to ensure consumer rights are protected.
• Work to progress legislation on mobile phone roaming costs, advancing the proposals approved by the European Parliament to end roaming fees within the EU by 2015.
• Work to progress legislation proposing card payment fee caps (at 0.3% of the transaction value for credit card transactions and at a maximum of seven euro for debit cards) and online payment safeguards.
• Ensure that legislation to deal with data protection pays particular heed to privacy where personal data is concerned, taking account of the European Court of Justice’s recent ruling on the Data Retention Directive.

A GREENER IRELAND

Fine Gael has a progressive approach to climate protection and has consistently supported EU pro-activity and leadership on climate policy. We have done this by seeking to frame the internal agenda and the positive influence which the EU strives to bring to the wider international agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

When Fine Gael entered government in 2011 there were 20 open environmental infringement cases against Ireland taken by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), most of which related to long-standing failures to transpose EU Directives. Moreover, Ireland lacked a long-term, sustainable and progressive policy to deal with the reality of climate change.

By making the resolution of environmental infringements a key priority, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan TD, established a dedicated Environmental Compliance Unit to engage actively with the European Commission in reducing the number of infringements. Fine Gael in government addressed compliance issues, introducing a range of primary and secondary legislation across the broad spectrum of environmental areas such as habitats, water services, air quality, waste, planning, and energy performance in buildings

At EU level, a policy debate has just begun regarding the framework for climate and energy to 2030; this represents the next phase in the EU’s transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy by 2050. Fine Gael supports in principle the proposed targets set out in the European Commission’s proposals - a 40% reduction in EU-level greenhouse gas emissions and a proposed EU-wide 27% target for renewable energy by 2030.

Fine Gael will:
• Work in the European Parliament to ensure that the EU’s new framework for climate and energy is ambitious while also being flexible and sustainable on environmental, economic and competitiveness grounds.
• Work in the European Parliament to ensure that decisions on new environmental policies are based on reliable data and that policy options are considered in the context of implications for Member States, including Ireland.
• Maintain Ireland’s position among the top Member States in terms of timely transposition of new Directives by proactively engaging with Irish stakeholders, including NGOs, thereby minimising the risk of new infringements.
• Within the framework of EU agricultural policy development, promote Ireland as a green food island.

A HEALTHIER IRELAND

While the governance of the health area is a national competence, Member States face similar challenges including demographic changes which include European citizens living longer than ever before. Similarly, European States are grappling with the challenges of diseases, such as cancer, which claim hundreds of thousands of lives every.

Many Irish children face very serious health consequences arising from the childhood obesity. The World Health Organisation has now identified a global epidemic of obesity which has very serious consequences for life expectancy, quality of life, and the provision of services. The challenge of combatting childhood obesity and addressing food poverty is being tackled through national strategies and campaigns including the Special Action Group on Obesity, established by the Minister for Health, Dr. James Reilly TD. However, this is an EU-wide problem.

The European Union institutions provide fora for Member States to work together to share best practice and develop shared solutions to mutual challenges. Fine Gael MEPs have been particularly active in the European Parliament in introducing measures to reduce smoking. Last February, the European Parliament voted in favour of the Tobacco Products Directive which includes an EU wide tracking and trading system to combat illicit trade in tobacco products

and larger warnings on packaging. This Directive complements national legislation such as the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill, 2013.

E-Health is about providing better services to patients through the use of technology and Ireland has developed an e-Health Strategy which proposes a number of innovations including e-prescriptions, online referrals and unique identifiers for patients.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work in partnership with colleagues in the European Parliament to find shared solutions to the global epidemic of childhood obesity and to the related issue of food poverty.
• Continue to work to develop legislation which tackles threats to human health, and which will enhance our citizens’ lives. We can do this by building on the success of the Tobacco Products Directive and progressing European initiatives to combat the acceleration of diseases such as Alzheimer’s.
• Ensure that the aspirations in the Declaration on e-Health are made a reality so that patients throughout the EU have access to better, safer healthcare and greater opportunities to manage illnesses through the use of advanced technologies.
• Campaign for new EU rules which would simplify and harmonise the rules on approving clinical trials while ensuring the protection of subjects.
• Work to bring EU proposals on medical devices to fruition to deliver a safer, more effective regulatory framework in Europe which promotes innovation in the medical devices sector.

3. IRELAND IN EUROPE, EUROPE IN THE WORLD

Our European Union membership provides Ireland with a strong voice in Europe. In turn, the European Union is a powerful force on the world stage. The EU, in particular through the office of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, has a vital role to play in building, brokering and sustaining peace through diplomacy.

The debate about the UK’s relationship with the EU and the potential referendum in 2017 could have very serious consequences for Ireland. At the EU’s eastern borders, by contrast, the desire for countries such as Ukraine to develop closer ties with the EU and to avail of the freedoms and values that come with it is indicative of the benefits of EU membership. Fine Gael is committed to ensuring the development of a Union that continues to deliver on its core mandate for its citizens while supporting other countries and on the road to prosperity and security.

THE EU’S EASTERN NEIGHBOURS

The Western Balkan countries The countries of the Balkans have overcome many challenges in the last two decades, overcoming significant conflict and bloodshed. The EU has played a crucial role in that process. Croatia is now an EU Member State and other Balkan States are working towards developing their relationship with the EU in the hope of one day becoming full members.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Support the process of accession for Montenegro and Serbia.
• Work to build stronger relationships between the EU and Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) through political dialogue.
• Work with Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the implementation of the ‘Growth Compact’ and the expansion of the structured dialogue to include governance and the fight against corruption.

Ukraine Fine Gael is strongly of the view that, as a small country which has traditionally relied on respect for the rule of law as the fundamental guarantor of stability in the international system, Ireland should take a firm position on developments in Ukraine. Fine Gael supports the Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have played an active role at EU level in responding to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work through the European Parliament to help Ukraine to function as a stable and secure State with a stable and inclusive Government.
• Support EU efforts to further strengthen its political association and economic integration with Georgia and Moldova.

The Middle East Following the changes brought about by the Arab Spring, it is important that the EU works closely with its Middle Eastern neighbours to support democratic developments in the countries concerned to ensure that all the countries of the Mediterranean are democratic, stable and prosperous.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work through the European Parliament to support the resolution of conflicts, in particular the Middle East Peace Process.
• Support the growth of democracy in countries transitioning to democracy.
• Continue to promote discussions at EU level on actions that can be taken to alleviate the plight of refugees and displaced persons arising from the conflict in Syria.
• Seek to address the genuine concerns arising from engagement in the Syrian conflict by EU citizens and their radicalisation.

EU REFORM

As the Union grows we must ensure that its institutions develop with it. We must seek the most effective ways of addressing the concerns of Member States and ensure that the institutions work for, and in the name of, all of the people they represent.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to maintain the Community Method which ensures an independent and well functioning Commission. The Commission’s sole right of initiating legislation ensures a level playing pitch for all Member States. This must be protected.
• Deliver reform of the EU institutions within existing Treaties. Better use of the tools that are already available, such as reasoned opinions, yellow cards and sunset clauses, must be explored in a bid to put power back in Member States’ hands.
• Advance a proposal which would allow Commissioners to come before national parliaments so that the link between the two can be strengthened.
• While respecting the debate that is on-going in the UK about that country’s future relationship with the EU, encourage Britain to remain as a strong and committed member of the European Union by stressing that the Union is stronger with the UK in it.

COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY (CSDP)

While we look to protect the social and economic well-being of our own citizens, we cannot be immune to the threats faced by vulnerable men, women and children in fragile States, in conflict zones and by those suffering from natural and man-made disasters across the globe. The EU and its Member States can bring a comprehensive approach to the promotion of international peace and stability through a unique combination of civilian, diplomatic, economic, development, justice, security and defence instruments. Only with a strong European Common Security and Defence Policy will we be able to promote our values and interests in a rapidly changing world.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Ensure that the European Parliament expands its scrutiny of the Common Security and Defence Policy in order to increase democratic accountability.
• Continue to support Irish participation in selected CSDP missions in line with our foreign and defence policy objectives.

MIGRATION, ASYLUM AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

Increased irregular migration, illicit arms, drug trade and human trafficking, as well as international terrorism are challenges of the globalised world. Europe needs to protect its borders and find a balance between minimising the threat of crimes and maximising ease and convenience of movement. Human trafficking, the slavery of our time, remains a serious problem for all Member States including Ireland. Frontex is a co-ordinating cross-national body that examines how different countries police their borders. Fine Gael and its sister parties in the EPP, want to see the role of Frontex strengthened, together with the creation of a European Coast Guard.

A European Asylum System Asylum is a fundamental right, granted to people fleeing persecution or serious harm in their own country. Since 1999, the EU has been working to improve the legislative framework governing asylum and to create a Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The Common European Asylum System and the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office provides for standards to qualify for asylum, minimum standards for reception facilities for asylum seekers and the establishment of Eurodac for the comparison of fingerprints in all Member States.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Work to strengthen Frontex, increase its role and support cross-border cooperation to combat human trafficking across the EU and beyond.
• Work towards the creation of a European Coast Guard.
• Ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the obligations of International law, including the Geneva Convention are reflected in immigration policies.
• Tackle the abuse of asylum systems by building partnerships between the EU and countries of origin and transit, helping them to develop their own asylum systems.

POLICE, JUDICIAL AND CUSTOMS COOPERATION

The European Arrest Warrant demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime in the EU. Similarly, the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU secured agreement on a civil European Protection Order measure which means that a civil protection order, such as a barring order for domestic violence, can still be enforced if the victim travels, or moves, from one EU Member State to another.

Fine Gael MEPs will work to develop further opportunities for cross-border cooperation on policing and justice including:
• The creation of a European Investigation Order to addresses difficulties in obtaining information and evidence in cross-border cases.
• The provision of strong supports and protection for victims of crime regardless of where in the European Union they fall victim to the crime.
• Cooperation between Member States to provide for innovative and flexible responses to cybercrime, including legislative measures, police training and support for cross-border cyber investigations.

Serious Crime Serious and organised crime and terrorism are threats to democracy that do not stop at a country’s border. Moreover, Member States of the European Union can best tackle serious crime and terrorism through cooperation and sharing best practice. Tackling corruption and white collar crime is essential to protect our citizens and our economies and to maintain confidence in our system of government.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Implement the new four year EU Action Plan on Drugs agreed during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU.
• Ensure the legislative framework in the EU facilitates the targeting and seizure of criminal assets from criminal organisations that operate across national borders.
• Campaign to exclude from participation in any public contract throughout the EU any enterprise that has been found to have participated in a criminal organisation, money laundering or any other serious crime.
• Promote extradition agreements with third countries and mutual legal assistance agreements, as they are key to fighting organised crime at a global level.

DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE

Developing links beyond the borders of the European Union is key to our continued growth and development. America, China and the Gulf region have all been instrumental to our programme to maximise trade and economic growth. Assisting in the development of other nations is our duty and in our interests.

EU Policy on Development Cooperation The European Parliament Development Committee, of which MEP Gay Mitchell is an active member, ensured that the Parliament adopted a strengthened Development Cooperation Instrument 2014-2020. This Instrument, on which EU aid policy is based, focuses on poverty eradication initiatives, sustainable development, a human-rights-based approach, development of the private sector, policy coherence for development and coordination of donors’ aid policies. The Committee also contributed to setting out the post-2015 goals at the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Review Summit in September 2013.

The Development Committee of the European Parliament has also put a strong focus on increasing resilience and improving Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Strategies in developing countries to help them to cope with the negative effects of natural disasters and economic shocks.

Fine Gael MEPs will:
• Continue to develop a more effective approach to overseas development assistance.
• Work to ensure that progress continues in ensuring provision of insurance and social security in developing countries.
• Ensure that the EU plays a very strong role in promoting, defending and protecting the rights of women and children, especially in conflict or post-conflict zones and countries.
• Prioritise addressing violence against women and girls and tackle high maternal mortality through EU aid programmes and policies.
• Work with the Irish Government, through the European Parliament, to implement ‘One World One Future’, the Government’s policy for international development.
• Continue to work with our EU and international partners towards the full achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
• Continue working to ensure a rights-based approach to development in the post-MDG era that prioritises equality between the global North and South. This reflects Fine Gael’s commitment to UN processes on the post- 2015 development framework.

"EP 2014: Green Party","INTRODUCTION 

We know that together we can build a better Europe. It needs to be one that looks to the future but which delivers in the here and now. It needs to create a fairer economy, that gets us out of our crisis but that avoids boom and bust.

Instead, the EU has experienced a profound crisis over the past five years, with serious flaws exposed in its economic and political system. The solutions offered to date have failed to resolve the problems, and in some cases have made them worse. As a result we have seen a growing disillusionment with the EU, which threatens to undermine public confidence in an institution that has been so positive for Ireland.

It is the Greens in the European Parliament that have been offering the only real, effective alternative to this path. From investing in a new economy to data protection, and from the youth guarantee to energy efficiency, it is the Green Group of MEPs that have effectively challenged the status quo and provided a clear alternative.

The next five years will be crucial to determining whether Europe can make the changes necessary to face an increasingly globalised world. Europe needs to respond to this challenge with a broad investment in a Green economy. Since 2009 the European Greens have championed a Green New Deal that will increase Europe’s investment in renewables, ensure finance is properly regulated and create employment across the Union. The Greens, as the fourth largest group in the European Parliament, are well placed to put Europe on a fair and sustainable footing for the future.

Irish Green MEPs will be champions for this transition. We will encourage sustainable businesses here in Ireland that can export abroad, we will help communities to harness their abundant natural resources for the benefit of everyone and we will build a Europe that works for all of its citizens. Irish Green MEPs will work with our colleagues across the continent for policies that are good for Ireland and good for Europe.

THE FOCUS FOR IRISH GREEN MEPS
• A “Green New Deal” where Europe investment in an economy built to last – sustainable jobs and a green energy future;
• A Europe based on rights – protection for workers, digital and privacy rights, and combating discrimination in all its forms;
• A democratic EU – where citizens are heard instead of lobbyists, and where we bring Europe closer to the people;
• A Europe that leads on climate change – helping draft a global climate deal, and ensuring Europe plays its role in combating rising temperatures;
• A Europe that invests in the smart economy – making the continent a global leader for the smart, digital economy;
• A Europe that celebrates its cultures and languages

– protecting minority languages and promoting our varied and diverse cultures.

ECONOMY, JOBS, INVESTMENT AND THE EURO 

Since the outbreak of the crisis, Ireland has been hit worse than most Member States. But across Europe, too many people have been left unemployed and too many people have suffered from the short-sighted policies adopted by European leaders. The crisis has exposed serious weaknesses in the construction of the Eurozone and the single market. Too often, Member State governments have settled for short-term solutions that have failed to resolve the problems, with public confidence being lost along the way.

A change of economic direction is urgently needed, towards investing in a green economy that is rooted in greater solidarity, social justice, environmental protection and sustainable prosperity. We need to build an economy that will last, and make the necessary investments today for current and future generations.

At its core, this green policy is rooted in three objectives
1. A functioning monetary union that shares prosperity among all Member States;
2. A sustainable economy that is not based on environmental destruction, excessive public or private debt or an undue focus on GDP growth;
3. Social justice for all citizens of the European Union, regardless of which Member State they are in.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• Increased powers for the EU to protect the Euro, including implementation of effective banking union that cuts the link between banking and sovereign debt, limited mutualisation of existing debt and a more responsive EU budget. Such reforms are crucial to the future of the European Union, and must therefore be made in the most open and democratic manner. Closed door arrangements which ignore the role of the European Parliament go against the public’s demand for greater accountability and must be resisted; 
• Greater shared fiscal capacity to offset differences within the European Monetary Union, such as an autonomous euro area budget providing the euro area with a fiscal capacity to help Member States absorb economic shocks. Such a scheme could take the form of an insurance system to pool the risks of economic shocks across Member States, thereby reducing the fluctuations in national incomes; Greater ‘own revenues’ for the EU such as polluter taxes and the full implementation of the financial transaction tax across the EU; To use the 2016 review to correct some of the mistakes of the 2014-2020 budget, such as restoring funding to the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF); Youth Unemployment is a problem across the Union, but is especially focused in a number of Member States. Irish Green MEPs will work to ensure the EU focuses as much on reducing the number of young people without jobs as it does on deficits and debt. The Youth Guarantee is not adequately funded, and current macro-economic policies will not resolve the problem;
• A recognition that tax competition is damaging public services and public budgets across Europe, and that agreement needs to be reached between all Member States to ensure corporations and wealthy individuals pay an adequate amount into national treasuries.
• A sharing of information and a coordination of tax policy, to ensure corporations and wealthy individuals are unable to avoid their tax obligations;
• Unless trade agreements, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership currently under negotiation, bring about a substantial increase in environmental, labour and social rights, the benefits will not outweigh the losses and the Greens will oppose them. Irish Green MEPs will express a strong preference for multilateral trade agreements that provide fair and transparent rules for all participants;
• Reform European investment institutions to ensure that all investment plans and projects commit to environmental and social development across Europe;
• Require Member States to establish public banks, if not already present, so as to ensure both a more stable banking system and adequate investment in essential infrastructure;
• Support strong local economies that can be the foundation of a strong European economy. Irish Green MEPs will work for a reform of state aid rules, increased regional investment, changes to procurement rules and the protection of local culture and diversity.

DEMOCRACY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY 

Even before the crisis, too many of Europe’s citizens felt disconnected from decisions taken at EU level. There is a feeling across Europe that such decisions are being taken without considering their impact on people’s daily lives and without legitimacy. While the European Parliament has been given considerable powers under the Lisbon Treaty, including the right to decide on almost all legislation, this problem remains fully unresolved.

The reasons for this are several, but one of the biggest is that European leaders have responded to the crisis with a seemingly never-ending series of decisions made behind closed-doors. Citizens will never have confidence in the EU unless all of its decisions are made in an open and transparent manner, where people feel their voices can be heard.

The Greens have always led the way in ensuring democratic participation, and were instrumental in pushing for more power for the European Parliament and more transparency in how decisions are made.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• Oppose decision-making through undemocratic and non-transparent intergovernmental processes (the ‘late night’ closed-door decision-making by European leaders);
• A stronger role for a reformed Seanad Eireann in scrutinising EU legislation and decisions. Such a role would involve greater examination of European legislation, a role for debate with Irish MEPs and oversight of decisions made by the Council of the EU;
• Support an end to the European Parliament’s “two seats” arrangement, where the Parliament splits its work between Strasbourg and Brussels. This is both wasteful and environmentally damaging, and reduces the Parliament’s effectiveness;
• A mandatory register of Brussels lobbyists, to bring greater transparency concerning the 20,000 lobbyists operating in the city;
• A single national constituency for electing Ireland’s MEPs, bringing us in line with the 24 Member States who operate such a system;
• Reduce the level of expenses received by MEPs and ensure greater scrutiny and oversight of all Parliamentary funds;
• Confidence in the European Parliament has been eroded thanks to a number of scandals involving sitting MEPs. The European legislation relating to European Parliament elections must be expanded to include greater transparency of, and restrictions on, donations to candidates and political parties;
• Expand access to Europe’s democracy. This includes extending voting rights in European Parliament elections to those 16 and over and ensuring European Citizens can vote in each others national elections.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY

The impact of climate change has never been more evident, and the scientific consensus has never been stronger. We must rapidly shift to a low-carbon economy or risk temperature rises above 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, which would be disastrous for our planet and future generations. Recent years have exposed the fragility of both our economy and our planet. The environment can’t stand, and the public cant bear, a constant boom and bust. Resilience must therefore be the guiding principle of our economy, but in particular of our energy policy.

However daunting this challenge may be, we can take comfort in knowing that the transition to a low-carbon economy is one that brings countless benefits. Ending our dependence on fossil fuels, both imported or otherwise, and creating green jobs will bring a much-needed boost to our economy, a boost that is sustainable and long lasting. While the scientific consensus exists, too many political leaders are dragging their feet on the action that is needed. Misled by fossil-fuel lobbyists and wedded to the status quo, European leaders have squandered the last five years. A repeat performance will surely put us on the road to climate disaster.

The next European Parliament must act decisively in favour of a low-carbon economy. Some of Europe’s ageing energy infrastructure needs upgrading while other infrastructure needs to be phased out entirely. This is essential to both combating climate change and making the necessary energy transition fit for a 21st century economy. Decisions made now will lock us in for decades, and so we must therefore take the path that leads to a green-energy future. Achieving this aim is not just a question of setting targets, crucial as they are. A drive for a green economy must be done in a way that shares any costs fairly across society and where consultation is the basis of all decisions made. No one part of Europe or no one part of society should bear an excessive cost in this switch, which if done properly, will have benefits for all.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• Combating climate change should be a core policy of the EU. This includes leadership at international level as well as ambitious domestic climate action through investment in renewable energies, energy efficiency, and support for adaptation to climate change;
• Support a European climate law, built on existing national and regional initiatives;
• Support for ambitious ‘triple targets’ for 2030 for renewable energy, energy efficiency and CO2 reduction, with at least a 45% target for efficiency and a 55% target for renewables and a 60% carbon reduction based on 1990 levels;
• If the EU is to be responsible for setting renewable energy targets, it must also accept the responsibility of ensuring Member States achieve these targets through a process that is democratic, has effective citizen participation and protects the natural environment;
• Ensure an effective pricing of carbon so as to support renewable energy sources;
• Effective environmental and liability regulation for nuclear energy and shale gas, which ensures these industries cannot pass these environmental and economic costs onto taxpayers. If effectively regulated and left without unfair subsidies, both nuclear and shale would be left economically unviable;
• Reform of EU State Aid rules to allow greater government support for green energy and energy efficiency and remove subsidies for outdated fossil-fuel industries;
• Member States must act to ensure greater community involvement in green energy, including ownership of local green energy projects;
• Continued EU support for smart energy grids within and between Member States as an essential means of ensuring the energy transition takes place;
• Use the 2016 EU budget review to reverse the 50% cut to the European Union Solidarity Fund, which is used to assist Member States which suffer from natural disasters such as flooding, to the levels of the previous budget.

A EUROPE OF RIGHTS 

Under the current direction of the EU, its citizens are left with the feeling that their rights are under attack. The economic crisis has been used as pretence to undermine workers’ and social rights. Growing inequality across the continent is leaving many people, particularly those in vulnerable and minority groups, left out. Authoritarian governments in some Member States are compromising core democratic principles. Migrants are dying on our borders without a response from the EU. And companies are happy to disregard the privacy rights of their customers in search of greater profit.

The EU’s response to these developments has been to turn a blind eye, or in the case of the ACTA Treaty, become an active participant in undermining rights. An excessive focus on deficit and debt figures has ignored the social consequence of the crisis. Five more years of this indifference will see the EU lose further credibility as an advocate for the protection of human rights.

A change of direction is urgently needed, and the Greens want to restore human rights to a central position in EU policy-making.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• The rescue packages for Member States such as Ireland have lacked any consideration of these social consequences. The European Parliament must continue its investigation into the Troika’s activities to help prevent a repeat of this process;
• EU policies have had an insufficient focus on the growing level of economic inequality within and between Member States. All policies adopted by the EU must be grounded in a drive for social justice, and in the understanding that economic inequality is both intolerable and a direct threat to Europe’s economic and social stability;
• Water supply and management of water resources must not be subject to ‘internal market rules’ and water services must be excluded from liberalisation.
• Stronger monitoring of Member States to ensure full compliance with accession criteria, the Copenhagen criteria, even after accession, to ensure they are abiding by democratic and judicial norms;
• The strongest possible data protection legislation, to ensure technological developments do not deprive citizens of their rights;
• Call for Ireland to offer whistleblower Edward Snowden political asylum in Ireland and to guarantee his safety and protection from arrest and rendition;
• Support gender quotas for corporate boards;
• Greater protection for posted workers;
• Ensure minimum labour standards are applied across Europe, so that countries such as Ryanair cannot ‘shop around’ for weakened workers’ rights;
• Reform of the Dublin 2 treaty for asylum seekers, and replace it with a Europe-wide system for legal entry that adequately shares the burden between Member States and ensures an effective and fair process for all applicants. Expand the remit of the EU’s Frontex agency to include rescues at sea and agree a pact with countries on the Mediterranean Sea to avoid more human tragedies and the unnecessary penalisation of victims rescued while attempting to enter the EU;
• Ensure EU Citizens working in other Member States have full access to their legal and social rights, which is a particular problem for Irish emigrants;
• Have the Commission draft and implement a roadmap for combating homophobia and ensure full support for other roadmaps such as those for disabled and Roma communities;
• Resist attempts by certain Member States to waterdown the founding principles of the EU, such as the free movement of people, which have been so crucial to our economic success but also our quality of life;
• Further education about our rights as citizens of the EU, including our access to information, democratic scrutiny and freedom of expression;
• Demand that all publicly accessible documents be made available in open source and machine readable formats to ensure equal accessibility to the visually impaired, blind, deaf and hard of hearing; and
• Strengthen protection provisions for victims of human trafficking including guarantees of legal assistance.
• EU membership is an aspiration that should not be denied to other states. For the Balkan region in particular, which has endured so much conflict, EU membership holds out the prospect of stable and peaceful cooperation. However membership must always be based on respect for core EU principles, both before and after joining. Accession should only be granted to those states that have demonstrated a lasting and firm commitment to fundamental rights such as LGBT rights and democratic norms.

ACCESSION AND NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY 

Accession is not an immediate prospect for some states, where a close relationship may be more effective for the medium-term future. EU neighbourhood policy should therefore be forward looking, with an emphasis on forming sustainable economic, social and political ties.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• Accession conditional on effective and independent democratic institutions, and the adequate protection of human rights;
• Support the Eastern Partnership and ensure it contains strong engagement with civil society organisations;
• The EU needs a responsible, sustainable neighbourhood policy, that reduces tragedies at our borders, retains development aid goals, fosters sustainable economies through fair trade and real support for strong democracies;
• LGBT rights must be a crucial aspect of EU neighbourhood policy

EUROPE IN THE WORLD 

When acting in concert, the EU can have an enormous impact on world affairs. The Greens want to ensure that this impact is positive. The past five years have seen some successes, such as the EU’s role in anti-nuclear proliferation negotiations with Iran, but other opportunities have been missed. Human rights must be the central element of the EU’s foreign policy, guiding all policies made in this area. The EU must lead by example, particularly in the area of climate change, where the 2015 COP negotiations will be crucial to our ability to minimise temperature increases.
• The EU’s foreign and security policy should be based on addressing the root causes of conflict and instability; this approach must then be complemented by assistance plans that prioritise the needs of conflict victims;
• Mainstream human rights in all its external affairs;
• Nuclear disarmament is an important goal. The EU must make full use of its diplomatic tools, such as sanctions, to prevent nuclear proliferation;
• Oppose financing military research from the EU budget and oppose arms deals to states with questionable human rights records;
• The EU has two tasks in the run up to the Paris COP in 2015 when a new global climate agreement will be adopted. First, it has to ensure it has a strong, agreed plan to fight climate change at home, in line with its responsibility, and corresponding to a fair share of the emission reductions needed globally. Secondly, that it reaches out to the rest of the world to secure as ambitious as possible an agreement, that will truly bring us on the path to a <2°C global warming; 
• Private European businesses play a major role in funding, facilitating and supporting Israeli violations of international law and illegal Israeli settlements. The EU should introduce Union-wide corporate guidelines to prevent such complicity; 
• The EU should cease economic engagement with illegal Israeli settlements and support the BDS (boycott, disvestment and sanctions) campaign; The EU needs to make good on its financial assistance to developing countries so that they can develop in a clean, climate friendlier way and so that the poorest can adapt to the consequences of the climate change we are already locked into; 
• A renewed commitment to development co-operation is necessary to ensure lasting and sustainable prosperity for countries receiving EU aid.

ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FISHERIES 

A strong, sustainable and growing agriculture sector must be at the heart of EU and Irish economic policy. For Ireland in particular, our unique resources and high-quality produce deserve recognition. EU policy in this area must be to ensure the protection of both the farming community and the environment, and the structure of the CAP programme can work in ways that benefit both. Funding must be disproportionally targeted at smaller and new farmers, and close cooperation must be used to ensure environmental measures are adopted in the most efficient way possible.

On food regulation, cooperation at EU level is the most effective means of ensuring people know what they are eating. The strongest possible tracing and transparency measures must be adopted to ensure consumers have full confidence in what is being produced.

The recent reforms of the common fisheries policy are a step in the right direction and can be the basis of a sustainable fishing industry that ensures maximum employment for coastal economies. These reforms must be fully implemented, with sufficient compensation for those communities that are negatively affected.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• CAP reform that ensures payments are directed towards small farmers and not large agri-business, and that payments are linked to reasonable environmental measures in the 2017 mid-term review;
• Introduce a cap on the maximum payment that can be received, so that support is directed to small and medium sized farmers, rather than large agribusiness;
• Support all measures that encourage a new generation of farmers;
• Full and effective implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy agreed in June 2013;
• The strongest possible food regulations, including full information for consumers and the adequate sharing of information between national authorities. Origin tracing should be transparent and reliable;
• Secure biodiversity and the protection of bees by supporting the ban on certain types of neonicotinoids and other types of environmentally damaging pesticides;
• Oppose further Commission approval of GMOs and defend the right of Member States to declare themselves GMO-free;
• Oppose the further privatisation of seeds and plant material in EU rules on seeds;
• The Greens have led the fight against animal testing under EU legislation and will continue to do so. We want to ensure animal transport is done in a way that maximises animal welfare. At international level, the EU must be more energetic in combating wildlife trafficking, protecting marine mammals and defending its ban on seal products.

TRANSPORT 

To ensure economic success reaches all parts of the Union, and to ensure that economic success is environmentally sustainable, there must be sufficient investment in Europe’s transport network.
• Adequate pricing mechanisms to ensure a shift in transport away from roads and the use of EU structural funds to support a sustainable transport system for Europe;
• Improve the energy efficiency of cars to help cut CO2 and fuel bills;
• Limiting of subsidies, including tax exemptions, for airlines and airports. They should exist only when there is a compelling case, for example the need to ensure peripheral regions have adequate access to the rest of the single market;
• Expand the use of European development funds to support cycling planning and infrastructure, including the development of cross-border cycling routes;
• Support new measures to improve the design of trucks, which will improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians.

EUROPEAN CULTURES, CREATIVITY, HERITAGE AND THE ARTS 

Though the EU’s competencies and budget in this area are limited, it should at all times advances policies that support, celebrate and grow Europe’s diverse range of cultures and languages. As a conservationist movement, the Greens remain committed to protecting our linguistic and cultural diversity.

Cultural and Creative industries (CCIs) support millions of jobs across Europe, with indigenous sectors such as architecture, publishing, film, gaming, multimedia and the visual arts all showing huge potential for growth. For the potential in these industries to take root, the EU must continue to champion creativity, and provide appropriate funding and support mechanisms to these sectors.

If elected, Irish Green MEPs will work on the basis of the following policies and objectives:
• Support the diverse mix of cultures, languages, heritage and artistic creativity in Europe which is good for communities, the economy and quality of life;
• Restrictions for artists, in the form of grant unavailability, travel restrictions and costs, as well as underexplored opportunities in the digital economy could be significantly improved by more cohesive EU-wide approaches;
• Support Irish as an official language of the EU and ensure adequate funding for its full realisation.

Foreword

On 23rd May, in the European Parliament elections, your vote will give you the opportunity to deliver a Europe that puts jobs first, a Europe that protects its citizens, a Europe that delivers.

In government, Labour has put relentless focus on growth, creating jobs and tackling the economic crisis left by the previous administration. There has been positive and encouraging progress. 5,000 new jobs are now being created each month, a stark contrast to the 7,000 jobs that were being lost each month up to 2011. 70,000 new jobs were created since the peak of the economic crisis.

In 2013, Labour ensured that jobs and growth was put at the heart of the Irish Presidency of the European Union, particularly by securing agreement on a €940 billion EU budgetary framework for 2014-20 aimed at achieving the Europe 2020 strategy of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

Labour’s MEPs and candidates are dedicated to fighting for a secure future for you and your family. It was through the leadership of Labour MEPs and MEPs from our sister parties in the European Parliament, that important measures such as the European Youth Guarantee to help get young people in Ireland into quality jobs, education or training were secured.

Labour was centrally involved in securing the three main social achievements of the outgoing European Parliament identified by the European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) in April 2014 – the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), the European Youth Guarantee and setting a minimum (20%) allocation for tackling poverty under the 2014-20 European Social Fund.

May 23rd- Europe’s first General Election The 23rd May European elections are the most important yet – they are Europe’s first General Election.

The European Parliament now plays a much more significant role at European level than ever before. And this year’s European elections will be the first to determine who becomes President of the European Commission, and who will set the EU’s agenda for the next five years.

Labour with our sister parties across 27 countries are part of the influential and progressive Socialists & Democrats (S&D) Group. Over the last five years of a conservative majority in the EU, we have fought for a strong, socially just and democratic Europe. By voting for Labour you can make the S&D the strongest group in the European Parliament and ensure that Labour’s progressive nominee, Martin Schulz, becomes the next President of the European Commission. This will put Europe’s primary focus on growth and jobs, protecting workers and families, social Europe, and on getting the best deal for the people of Ireland in Europe.

A vote for Labour and our sister parties across Europe is the best chance of challenging and halting the rise of the extreme right. Because only we believe that Europe must do more to promote jobs and growth, and stem the politics of fear and hatred, that Europe must be grounded in the solidarity that is the fundamental value of our movement.

Our programme for the next five years of the European Union is based on growth and job creation, a productive economy, a sense of community and respect for people.

1. Putting Decent Jobs & Growth First in Europe

Labour’s relentless focus in Government is on job creation. We are tackling the legacy of the recent economic crisis that has left too many people without work, including a significant amount of our young people.

Encouraging progress is being made. 5,000 new jobs now being created each month and the Live Register dropping to its lowest level in five years. This is our first and main priority: all citizens, women and men, must have the chance of a decent job that allows a good quality of life. Ireland is at last heading in the right direction.

Labour knows that Europe has an important role in Ireland’s recovery, to ensure a real recovery for our people and to achieving our goal of full employment. 54% of all the exports which go out through our ports and airports go to member states of the European Union. Jobs in Ireland, the success of Irish businesses and Irish living standards all depend on the health of the European economy.

A Threshold of Decency at Work

Labour in government has strongly focused on maintaining a threshold of decency for workers. We renegotiated the Troika programme left by Fianna Fail; restored the Minimum Wage; took 330,000 lower paid workers out of the USC tax net, and restored the Joint Labour Committee system for the setting of fair rates of pay above the statutory minimum wage for workers in sectors such as retail, hospitality, catering, security, contract cleaning and agriculture.

We want an EU that promotes social justice and fairness and that allows all citizens to participate in the economy as equals.

We will:
• Build upon the 2014 European Quality Framework for Interns to raise standards for all internships.
• Ensure all trade agreements are bound to the protection of people’s human and social rights, decent work, environmental standards, as well as corporate social responsibility and fair trade principles.
• Promote better cooperation at European level on labour inspections, including by ensuring better protection for whistle-blowers reporting abuses.
• Continue to campaign for the adoption of a comprehensive EU health and safety strategy for 2014-20.

Tackling Youth Unemployment

Creating more and better jobs for young people is the greatest crisis facing Ireland and facing Europe. This remains a key priority for us as part of our long-term commitment to achieving full employment.

Labour have been at the forefront of delivering €6 billion for the European Youth Guarantee. Around €130 million has been secured to start the implementation of Ireland’s Youth Guarantee programme in 2014 and 2015 and an important pilot is already being rolled out in Ballymun. Central to our youth job strategy is the full implementation of our Youth Guarantee plan.

• We will seek to Increase EU funding for the roll-out of the European Youth Guarantee using the European Social Fund, other EU Funds, the European Investment Bank, the re-direction of unspent EU funds, and by ensuring additional funding during the mid-term EU budgetary review in 2016.
• We will use the European Alliance for Apprenticeships and the new Erasmus+ programme to improve Ireland’s apprenticeship system, particularly in identified ‘jobs-rich’ sectors such as the green economy, healthcare and ICT.

Supporting SMEs
Ireland’s small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of the Irish economy.

In government, and at European level, Labour has prioritised the needs of this vital sector of our economy.

• The EU budget and the European Investment Bank must play a bigger role in expanding credit to fund investment and employment in Ireland. Europe needs to do more to help Irish SMEs break into new international markets. We will:
• Seek to use the new €2.3 billion Competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (COSME) programme for the benefit of Irish SMEs in tackling the problem of access to finance, and to improve access to markets for SMEs across Europe, and beyond, as well supporting entrepreneurs and the establishment and growth of new businesses.
• Campaign to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and disproportionate red tape so as to promote investment, employment and prosperity.
• Seek to ensure that the 2014-20 Structural and Investment Funds show greater awareness of the needs of SMEs, which do not have the same capacity or resources as larger firms to prepare detailed applications for EU support.
• Encourage Irish access to the €800 million Employment and Social Innovation Programme which will provide micro-finance to help business start-ups through its Microfinance Facility to micro-entrepreneurs.
• Seek to secure funding for Irish researchers from the €80 billion Horizon 2020 programme.

2. Securing the Best Deal for Ireland in Europe

Legacy Bank Debt

Since entering government, Labour has focused on keeping its promise to the Irish people to fix the broken economy. Last year we successfully renegotiated the Promissory Note. Since then we have also shut down Anglo, exited the bailout and said goodbye to the Troika. We are now working on getting a reduction on Ireland’s legacy banking debt issue so that it does not threaten the economic recovery which is well underway.

In March 2014, Labour secured the first ever European Parliament recognition that the private losses of private banks were placed on the shoulder of Irish taxpayers in order to minimise the risk of contagion to the wider Eurozone and unequivocally endorsing Ireland’s campaign to lessen the legacy debt burden. This was another important milestone in lessening the legacy debt burden that arose from the blanket bank guarantee in 2008.

We will continue to strongly make Ireland’s case with the key European institutions, including launching a dedicated campaign within the Economic and Monetary Committee, to secure a deal on reducing the toxic bank debt left by Fianna Fail.

Getting the Best Deal for Ireland in Europe

Labour supports the Euro and Ireland’s continued membership of the single currency. We believe in stable public finances, in bringing down deficits and in managing public debt in a sustainable and fair way.

The European Parliament must be fully involved in the exercise of the democratic control over these policies.

We will be tough guardians of the spending of EU funds, cutting out waste and fraud and directing expenditure to areas where it can make the greatest impact and get the best value for citizens.

Putting the financial sector at the service of citizens and the real economy

Irish citizens have had to endure a heavy burden for the disastrous blanket bank guarantee imposed by the previous government.

Indeed, citizens across Europe have had to pay dearly for the mistakes and irresponsibility of an unregulated financial sector.

Regulation of the financial sector has been significantly strengthened at national and at EU level. But we believe it can be strengthened even further and we are committed to putting in place an even stronger framework that will make the financial sector work for the real economy and for employment.

We will:
• Fight for further regulation of the banking sector, to curb financial speculation and implement adequate firewalls between Commercial and Investment Banking.
• Insist on the creation of an independent and public European Credit Rating Agency.
• Continue our efforts to ensure access to credit in Ireland and across Europe.

3. A More Democratic Europe

Europe must be made more democratic and more responsive to the needs of its citizens. That is why we, with our sister parties, put forward a common candidate, Martin Schulz, as our nominee for European Commission President.

For the first time in EU history, you will have a direct say in who runs Europe but we must work towards more democratic participation and control for citizens over European Union decisions.

Enhanced Role for European Parliament

We want a more prominent role for the European Parliament, which must exercise real democratic control. Decisions must be taken at the most appropriate level, be it regional, national or European, in the interest of European citizens. All policies must be efficient, respect democratic values, fight corruption and serve citizens in an open and transparent way. We will put in place effective European responses to breaches of fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law.

4. A Europe that Protects its Citizens

The EU has a strong track record on promoting equality, workplace rights and environmental protections.
• We believe more must be done to fight for a Europe that leaves no one behind and that tackles all forms of discrimination.
• We will work for the adoption of a coherent European anti-poverty strategy.
• We will work for the adoption of European Social Pact, that lays down common standards to be guaranteed in all member states - on fundamental labour and social rights, social protection and equal pay and conditions for work of equal value.
• We will continue to work for the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.
• We will be relentless in our fight against all forms of homophobia, transphobia and intolerance
• We stand for the values of equality and of non-discrimination between women and men.

A Safer and Healthier life for all
• All citizens deserve to live a safe and healthy life.

We want stronger rules that give consumers’ more power. We will strive for safer food, safer products and a safer living environment.

Tackling Crime Across the EU
• The EU should guarantee citizens’ right to security by promoting cooperation in the fight against organised and cross-border crime. Implementation of the revised directive on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime should be used to promote the social re-use of seized criminal assets, in line with the recommendations Labour MEPs secured in the European Parliament’s 2013 resolution on Organised Crime.

Protecting Citizens’ Privacy
• We will support EU legislation on the protection of citizens’ personal data and access to information.

Towards an Age-Friendly Europe
• We will campaign for Europe to become more age-friendly by seeking to create age-friendly economies and societies, including measures on carers’ leave for workers with informal care duties.

Safeguarding the rights and wellbeing of children
• We support the establishment of a permanent mechanism within the European Parliament with an explicit responsibility for protecting and promoting children’s rights across all EU policy areas, both within the EU and externally.

A Europe for persons with disabilities
We support a Europe that protects and promotes the enjoyment of human rights of all persons in Europe with a disability. We will:
• Support the establishment of mechanisms with the EU institutions to mainstream the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
• Seek to ensure enhanced EU recognition and support for sign languages in member states, including through EU education and citizenship programmes.

Protecting Against Extremism & Combatting Racism
• Against rising extremism, we will fight for a Europe that respects everybody’s rights and obligations, not one that is based on prejudice, hate and division.

Reinforcing the Fight Against Human Trafficking
• The fight against human trafficking must be reinforced. We will support the adoption of a comprehensive EU strategy towards the eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings, to follow-on from the existing strategy which expires in 2016.

5. Ensuring a Greener Europe

The EU must regain global leadership on the protection of nature and natural resources and the fight against pollution and climate change. We will support clean technology and environmentally friendly production. We support further binding targets on the reduction of carbon emissions, the increased use of renewable energy and improved energy efficiency.

Supporting the Green Economy
• We will promote appropriate investment in the green economy, renewable energy and technology. This way we will reduce pressure on scarce natural resources and help citizens to reduce their energy bills and their ecological footprint.

Tackling Climate Change and promoting a sustainable Europe

Labour in government has driven the process of establishing landmark climate change legislation which sets out a clear path for tackling climate change, in line with our EU 2020 targets. Under this legislation, Ireland will be one of the first Member States to adopt climate change legislation and put a legal obligation on its Government to develop policies to plan for existing, and future, climate commitments.

We will campaign for separate, ambitious and binding EU targets for 2030 for renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency and will work with towards reaching an ambitious new global climate agreement in Paris at the end of 2015.

6. Supporting Farming Families & Rural Ireland

Farming and rural economies continue to be at the heart of Irish society and economy. Labour has always worked to secure the best deal possible for Irish agriculture and rural communities. We recognize the key strategic role of agriculture and fisheries for Irish society, and will promote a sustainable and thriving rural development.

Supporting Agriculture & the Rural Economy

Labour MEPS and Ministers helped secure a reformed Common Agricultural Policy which will provide a total of €12.5 billion in EU and national funding to support farming and to assist rural development and aid economic recovery in rural areas to 2020. We are determined to ensure that we get the best deal possible for farming families and communities in Europe in the 2014-202 period and we will:

• Use CAP to create growth and employment in rural areas.
• Ensure that funding allocated to Ireland under the 2014-2020 CAP agreement is fully used for the benefit of agriculture production and farm incomes.
• Work to resolve all outstanding issues in terms of the implementation of the recent CAP reform process.
• Reduce unnecessary and disproportionate red-tape on the farming sector.
• Provide greater incentives and support for young farmers in particular.
• Challenge cartel-like behaviour that exploits farmers and pushes up prices for consumers.
• Support measures to ensure that there is more equitable balance in the food chain supply especially in relation to small and medium sized producers.
• Prioritise equality of food standards and a fair deal for Irish producers in all EU trade talks.
• Encourage agri-food businesses to utilise funds available to support Irish SMEs to break into international markets – smaller “craft” food and drink producers should be particularly supported.
• Ensure that food entrepreneurial businesses are properly represented in terms of accessing funding and support at EU level.
• Work with community stakeholders and organisations to encourage the provision of clinics or workshops for young farmers on how to access funding for innovative farm practices at EU level.
• Encourage the use of EU funding secured by rural or isolated communities for the development of community projects - such as community centres which would act as a hub for all age groups - in unused publicly owned buildings.

Ensuring Balanced Regional Development & Supporting the Border Region

No region or part of the country should be left behind when it comes to development of EU polices and access to EU funding. During the Irish EU Presidency, Eamon Gilmore led negotiations on new seven-year budget for the EU and secured €150 million in funding for a new PEACE programme. A new INTERREG programme to support the region will also soon be finalised.

• We will work to leverage EU and European Investment Bank funding to ensure balanced regional development to drive growth and jobs in all regions.
• We will drive support for the Border region, in particular in terms of funding for cross-border initiatives to support local job creation and the local economy.
• We will push for a focus on young people who are not in employment, education or training in the new PEACE programme.
• We will focus new INTERREG funding of over €200 million on Research and Development, sustainability and social inclusion in order to diversify the local economy and increase opportunities in the Border region.

Fisheries and Coastal Communities 

We have a unique marine heritage and the fisheries sector provides vital local employment and is a driver of economic activity in coastal communities all around Ireland. Labour MEPs will continue to use the enhanced decision-making role for the European Parliament on European Fisheries policy to support and promote coastal communities and our unique maritime sector.

7. A Europe that promotes peace, security and development

The European Union must respect the universal principles of democracy, peace and respect for human rights, including women’s and children’s rights. In a globalised and changing world, with conflicts and growing inequalities, Europe must live up to its global responsibilities. We want Europe to have a strong voice and the proper tools to lead in promoting peace, democracy, and shared prosperity throughout the world.

We reaffirm that Ireland’s commitments under the treaties are fully compatible with our policy of neutrality and we believe that we Europe must support peace, security and development at a global level.

• We support the people struggling for democracy, social justice, non-discrimination and freedom against any form of occupation everywhere in the world, in particular in Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean region.
• We will continue to support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Europe has been actively and consistently encouraging the parties to the conflict to engage in genuine negotiations. While continuing to provide humanitarian and development aid to Palestinians, Europe must reiterate its calls for Israel to halt the expansion of settlements, lift the siege of Gaza, and cease house demolitions.
• We will promote a sustainable and just world, where people are empowered to overcome poverty and hunger and fully realise their rights and potential.
• We remain committed to achieving the target of 0.7% of Gross National Income allocated to international development cooperation. While recognising the present economic difficulties, we should move towards the 0.7% target when our economy improves.
• We must fight global inequality and poverty by promoting policy coherence for development and making the Millennium Development Goals and the UN post-2015 global development agenda a success.
",2014,"EP","Labour","Labour_2014_EP"
"EP 2014: PBP","What the European Union likes to call “democracy” increasingly works to defend the interests of big business, not the people of Europe. The Brussels corporate lobby is large, active, well-funded and well-connected. Therefore it has the power and the money to shape a large proportion of the legislation that comes out of the EU. If we consider the fact that as much as 50 per cent of our domestic laws now originate in Brussels, the direct impact on our lives of corporate Europe is considerable and it is growing.

Real Democracy – End the rule of the corporate lobbyists:

The Corporate Europe Observatory has exposed how BusinessEurope – one of the most powerful business lobby groups in Europe – is working hand in glove with European Commission to force through neoliberal reforms. This includes echoing BusinessEurope’s demands for ‘wage flexibility’ in order to keep labour costs down to make their profits rise. The European Commission is prioritising policies that mainly benefit transnational corporations instead of supporting workers rights and essential public services.

If elected Bríd Smith will shine a light on their activities and seek to drive them out. She will fight for a democratic Europe that is built on solidarity.

No Water Charges:

The EU Water Framework Directive is clear. Water charges should fully recover the cost of drinking water provision and waste-water disposal. It is industry not individual households that use, by far, the highest proportion of water. Yet the majority of the cost of water is been forced on to ordinary people through water charges of €560 per household per year.

Brid Smith and People Before Profit are completely opposed to water charges.

Defend Public Services – Stop Privatisation:

The EU bureaucracy pushes an endless agenda of privatisation and wants to cut back on public spending at all costs. The Irish government has already sold off parts of Bord Gais to a British company with a record of hiking up gas prices to bolster profits. This agenda of privatisation is clearly an ideological approach designed to support the ever more discredited neoliberal economy. It only benefits a small group of wealthy individuals, bankers and transnational corporations.

This insistence on entrenching neoliberalism is also profoundly anti-democratic. When given the chance, European citizens have voted against privatisation, demonstrating, for example, their resounding rejection of water privatisation in the 2011 referendum in Italy. Across Europe people are building powerful anti-privatisation campaigns to stop public services being sold off, like the campaign here in Ireland to stop the sell-off of our forests.

Bríd Smith says no to privatization. Instead we should tax the rich to fund our schools and hospitals.

Cancel the National Debt: The European Central Bank and their Irish allies have made us responsible for the private gambling debts of bankers. Each year we will spend €9 billion in interest payments on the national debt. In fact, according to Eurostat, Ireland has paid Ireland has paid 42% of the total cost of the European banking crisis, at a cost of close to €9,000 per person (does not take into account the €18bn put in from the National Pension Reserve Fund). The figures show that while the banking crisis cost Berlin €40bn, Ireland is liable for €41bn. If we faction in the size of population and GDP of the EU’s biggest state, the crisis has cost Ireland 25% of GDP and Germany 1.5%.

Even though the banking system has been allowed to destroy the lives of working people in Europe, new banking regulations that could go somewhere to protecting us from such future occurrences continue to be prevented by the powerful banking lobby who are worried that it way put a small dent in their obscene profits.

A vote for Brid Smith is a signal that the Irish people want to unilaterally cancel EU imposed debt.

Real Jobs – Not Forced Labour Schemes: There are approximately 5.7 million young people currently unemployed across Europe. The EU promotes schemes like the “Youth Guarantee” but when it come to funding schemes adequately they fall short. The ILO estimate that €21 billion would be needed to invest in jobs for young people yet only €6 billion has been put aside.

In Ireland, in the last budget €35 million was directly cut from young people, yet only €14 million was given back via the Youth Guarantee. Governments across Europe are forcing young people into unpaid internships and forced labour schemes where young people work for 22 months for as little as €1 an hour.

Bríd Smith stands for real jobs and proper government investment in public sector jobs and training.

Workers Rights

The EU has recently established a ‘nominal unit labour cost’ measure which seeks to limit wage rises over a three year period. The EU Commission is trying to block strong health and safety measures under the guise of removing ‘red tape’. Sometimes EU directives can be used to improve workers conditions. But, invariably, the Irish government tries to weaken these mild measures.

Brid Smith will highlight every directive that can be used to help workers and fight for them to be made Irish law. She will act as a watchdog for workers rights; she will not take the massive ‘fat cat’ EU salary but only the average workers’ wage and will donate the rest to political campaigning for working people.

Protect our Environment from Corporate Interests

Big Business uses its power and influence to undermine basic environment al protection. A recent proposal from the European Commission to tackle climate change was gutted after by lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. This type of lobbying creates a serious barrier to efforts to move away from dirty fossil fuels and transform the energy system. Instead the plans give a green light to the socially and environmentally damaging practice of ‘fracking’, the process of extracting hard-to-reach natural gas through hydraulic fracturing that is being championed by Big Oil as the new energy frontier.

Brid Smith opposes fracking and the nuclear power. Our planet can only be saved by a shift away from a competitive, for profit economy to one based on social need. We need democratic economic planning rather than spurious market driven mechanisms that do not work. Alternative energy sources need to be developed on the basis of public ownership not private greed.

No to TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership)

The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP was negotiated in secret between governments and business and will be used to weaken social, environmental and economic standards on both sides of the Atlantic (to create an ‘enabling environment’ conducive to business), It will give corporations the right to sue governments who try and legislate in the public interest, e.g. by banning GMOs, fracking or other socially and environmentally harmful practices. It will also give business a huge say in all future regulations. In short, TTIP will undermine democracy and the role of elected governments while further empowering the rights and role of corporations.

Brid Smith will oppose trade agreements that arise from secret negotations and which are designed to free corporations from greater public regulation.

Against EU Militarism – For a Europe of peace and freedom

EU Military expenditure in 2010 amounted to €194 billion which was the equivalent of the annual deficit of Greece, Spain and Italy combined. The EU Commission is actively promoting an EU arms industry through its Defence Industries Taskforce. Foreign interventions- often led by a former colonial power – are occurring more frequently. We are opposed to the growth of EU militarization and its increasing tendency to act at the behest of US foreign policy and NATO. We would like to see the EU adopt the same position of neutrality as that enshrined in the Irish Constitution (though in practice often undermined by the Irish government).

Brid Smith will expose and oppose any support for the arms industry. She will oppose EU imperial ambitions and demand it stop interfering in neighbouring countries, such as Ukraine. She will actively support peace movements in both the EU and countries like Russia. She will highlight the US’s continued use of Shannon airport and demand that the airport return to its neutral status.

People Before Profit’s Vision for a Different Europe

Bríd Smith and People Before Profit are not ‘anti-Europe’ – quite the contrary. It is the way the EU is run that we object to. We urge the closest cooperation between the Irish people and all the peoples of Europe. We positively welcome the people who come here as migrants and contribute so positively to Irish society, just as Irish migrants have contributed to so many countries round the world. We stand in solidarity with all those Europeans, be they Spanish or Greek, British or Polish, who are suffering from and resisting the austerity policies imposed by the EU commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF.

There is immense wealth in Europe. The economy of the European Union has a GDP of over €12.894 trillion which makes it the largest economy in the world if treated as a single economy. Our vision is of a Europe where this wealth is placed under the democratic control of its people and distributed fairly to serve the interests of the people.

Such a Europe would easily be able to afford free and good education for all its children and students; free and good health care for all its citizens; free and clean water for everyone; decent social housing for all its families and individuals.

We want to see a Europe in which education; health, water and housing are treated as basic human rights, not commodities or sources of private profit.

We want to see a Europe that treats all its citizens equally, regardless of race, nationality gender, sexual orientation or religion. We oppose racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, and religious intolerance.

We want to see a Europe that is at peace with the rest of the world and treats it with respect and equality.

We want a Europe that gives more not less aid to those suffering poverty and starvation in the Global South which in the past has suffered so grievously, as did Ireland, from British and European colonialism.

We want a Europe that plays a huge positive role in protecting the environment and combating both the causes and the consequences of climate change. We call for a ban on fracking throughout the EU and for a massive shift to renewable energy (solar power, wind power, tidal power).

We understand that bringing about this vision for an alternative Europe will require much more than electing MEPs. It will need a huge mobilization of people power across the continent. But, as the Indignados movement in Spain, the mass demonstrations in Portugal, and the great resistance in Greece have all shown, this is possible.

If elected Bríd Smith will use her position to encourage the mobilization of people power in Ireland and across Europe in every way possible.

1. Introduction

Eu in ireland’s crisis

The economic and social crisis that has engulfed the north and south of ireland since 2008 was caused by both domestic and european factors. The irish and british governments and key eu institutions including the european commission and european central bank all share responsibility.

While the north may have been sheltered from the worst excesses of the banking and currency crisis it has not been immune from the fallout as two of the four major banks in the north are southern based.

Austerity imposed by westminster and actively supported by the european union has had a significant impact on the local economy and on communities. The northern economy has contracted more than most areas in the eurozone and britain since 2008.
Irish people were the victims of bad government in dublin and london, bad irish and european banks and bad decisions in brussels and frankfurt. Nowhere is this more evident than in the issue of debt.

As the banking crisis unfolded in 2008 the fianna fáil-led government acquiesced to pressure from the european central bank governor jean claude trichet to bail out the banks, irrespective of the social and economic cost. The official policy in dublin and frankfurt was that no bondholder was to be burnt.

Fianna fáil and the green party protected the bondholders because many of them were part of the infamous golden circle. Bertie ahern and brian cowen stood by their friends in anglo irish bank.

The blanket banking guarantee of october 2008, the nationalisation of anglo irish bank in 2009, the €30 billion anglo irish bank promissory note and the €30 billion cost of recapitalisation of the bank of ireland and allied irish bank all flowed from this.

Despite opposing this policy when in opposition, once in government fine gael and labour continued to implement fianna fáil and ecb policy – pouring €17 billion of taxpayers’ money into aib and the bank of ireland, saddling future generations with the promissory note debt and extending the blanket banking guarantee, again and again.

The result was spiralling public debt (from 25% of gdp in 2007 to 120% of gdp in 2013) pushing up the cost of government borrowing and forcing the government deficit to rise even further.

The decision by fianna fáil and the green party to pile banking debt onto the shoulders of the taxpayer paved the way for the humiliating handover of our economic sovereignty to the troika bailout programme in 2010.

During the 2011 general election fine gael and labour promised to do things differently. Enda kenny’s party promised that not another red cent would go to banks until bondholders started to share the pain. Eamon gilmore promised that if elected it would be labour’s way not frankfurt’s way.

But once in office these promises were broken.

A similar agenda was pursued by the government in london – cutting the block grant to the assembly and seeking to impose reductions in social welfare protections.

In addition to advocating domestic austerity the european union cut its own budget, a decision that was supported by fine gael, labour, the unionist parties and the british government. The result of this cut has been a significant reduction in much needed financial supports for island of ireland.

A new direction for the eu

For too long a cosy consensus has existed in irish politics. The consensus extends from economic and social policy to ireland’s relationship with the european union.

It is a consensus that looks after the few to the detriment of the many.

Fianna fáil, fine gael and labour are the yes men of europe. Whatever brussels and frankfurt propose they support. Their meps are the eus representatives in ireland – promoting the agenda of the eu institutions rather than the interests of people in ireland in the eu.

When the single currency was being created they were warned of the dangers, particularly for smaller and economically weaker member states. The dublin government ignored these warnings and signed up to a currency union that was fraught with flaws – a disaster waiting to happen.

They have endorsed wholesale the european commission’s right wing social and economic agenda

– stripping back the gains of earlier battles to build a social europe.

Over the past five years sinn féin has stood against this brussels consensus – we have highlighted the negative impact of the policies of austerity and the erosion of democracy on the lives of people across ireland. We have opposed cuts to the eu budget for important strategic sectors such as agriculture, regional development and investment in jobs and growth.

It is time for a new direction, in ireland and in the eu institutions.

It is time to stand up for ireland and the interests of all of the people who share this island.

It is time to end the brussels power grab, to reign in the commission and return powers to the member states.

It is time to halt the attack on the wages and conditions of working people and to promote a basic threshold of decency for all.

It is time to put in place real supports for those forced out of work by the policies of austerity.

It is time to rebuild our public services and defend our public utilities – to ensure that people get the services they need in a fair and efficient manner.

A bigger and stronger sinn féin team of meps from across ireland can raise the volume on these issues and demand a better deal for ireland.

Ireland’s place is in the european union – but the european union needs to change. Bringing that change about means electing meps that put ireland first; joining sinn féin mep martina anderson to stand up for ordinary people.

2. Ending the eurozone crisis

The euro crisis is not yet over. While some commentators are saying the worst has passed, for most people, nothing has changed. Indeed while disagreements exist between the european parliament, commission and council on the details of how to resolve the crisis, there is a broad consensus on principle. They all want ‘more europe’. This is code for the further transfer of power from member states to the eu institutions – political power, economic power and fiscal power.

Fiscal federalism will not stabilise the euro. Greater european commission control of member states budgets will not stabilise the euro. A ‘one size fits all’ monetary policy was part of the problem - adding a ‘one size fits all’ fiscal and budgetary policy will only make matters worse.

Sinn féin is firmly of the view that what is required now is a different approach based on investment, social and economic growth, breaking the link between banking and sovereign debt and greater flexibility for member states to decide the best strategies for recovery.

Economic policy should be decided in ireland - not in brussels or london- by politicians elected by and accountable to the irish people, north and south.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• an end to the failed policies of austerity that forces the burden of the economic adjustment on low and middle income families.
• a definitive breaking of the link between sovereign and banking debt.
• eu wide banking regulation that forces financial institutions to pay their fair share of the cost of the crisis not just in the future but from the start of the current crisis.
• a new focus on eu wide investment to get europe’s unemployed millions back to work.
• a new eu convention with an explicit mandate to identify competencies to be returned to member states.
• eu support for transfer of fiscal power from london to the assembly in belfast.

3. Getting people back to work

The eu urgently needs investment in jobs, particularly in the periphery. This can be achieved by combining the resources of member states, including the €6bn in the discretionary portfolio of the national pension reserve fund (now the ireland strategic investment fund), with an enlarged investment fund in the european investment bank (eib).

Sinn féin is arguing that the existing funds of the eib should be supplemented by a once-off investment by eu member states on a proportional basis – this could either be achieved by a transfer from assets currently held by the european stability mechanism or by new transfers from governments.

There is also a need for the government in dublin to increase its access to eib funds. In the six years since the start of the crisis the state has drawn down on average €600 million per year from the european investment bank through a variety of projects. During their first two years in office the amount of eib funding secured by fine gael and labour actually fell.

When compared to other member states, the failure of successive irish governments to take advantage of these funds is clear. Portugal, with a population of 10.5 million claimed 5% of the eib’s total loans in 2011 and 2012. During the same period the south of ireland, with a population of 4.6 million claimed only 1% of the eib’s loans in each year.

In the north, the executive is prohibited from borrowing directly from the european investment bank. Eib funding was accessed for the redevelopment of the university of ulster campus development works, but there is a need for the assembly to be able to directly access these funds.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• increasing the investment capacity of the eib to assist private and public sector jobs growth focusing on the range of investment types carried out by the eib.

• eu support for lifting the borrowing ban on the assembly to target investment particularly in areas with high levels of unemployment, poverty and social disadvantage.

• amending the eib funding ratio for member states with above average unemployment rates to 75:25 with the eib paying the larger portion.

• a real youth guarantee fund of €21bn to tackle the youth unemployment crisis – based on the funding model outlined by the international labour organisation and the national youth council of ireland.

• a trebling of the applications from the irish government to the eib to assist in funding job creation projects including:

• revival of the sugar beet industry and construction of a new bio-refinery plant in the south east with the potential to create 5,000 jobs.

• investing in the rollout of next generation broadband throughout the island.

• the a5/n2 motorway from derry to dublin.

• the western arc rail connection (galway – mayo – donegal – derry – belfast).

• invest in capital infrastructure at knock airport.

• upgrading our water infrastructure to reduce water leakage.

• buying, renovating and building social housing units.

• building additional schools and refurbishing existing schools.

• building extra primary health care centres

4. Protecting those in work

Since the start of the crisis, the wages and working conditions of low and middle income earners have been hit badly. Across both the public and private sector the majority of workers have seen their real wages decline and their terms and conditions eroded. The gap between low and middle earners on the one hand and high earners on the other has widened.

A recent study by the nevin economic research institute has shown that the recession has hollowed out the middle of the labour market. Many profitable companies are using the economic crisis to drive down wages and conditions.

Across the eu, labour’s share of national income has been in steady decline since the start of the recession. Here, however, the rate of decline has been particularly severe falling from almost 55% in 2009 to almost 45% today.

As a result we are seeing an increasing number of people in low paid jobs and an increase in the number of working families living at risk of poverty. According to the cso eusilc survey 25% of the population in the south are now officially deprived. A recent oxfam report showed that 22% of people in the north are living in poverty. According to the institute of fiscal studies relative and absolute child poverty rates are set to increase over the next decade to 30.9% and 38.5% respectively in the north. In many eu member states vital social services have been undermined by the eu led liberalisation of services. Sinn féin is not only opposed to the further liberalisation of public services such as education, health and portal services but will actively campaign for the reversal of this agenda in favour of strong publically funded and delivered social services.

The unquestioning support of fianna fáil, fine gael and labour for eu austerity policies has resulted in the south of ireland having significantly more low wage earners than the eu average. Westminster directed austerity in the north has ensured that 25% of workers in the north do not even make a living wage.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• decent wages for decent work and against the low wage culture.

• an end to zero-hours contracts at home and across the eu.

• legislation on the right to collective bargaining and protecting the right to strike.

• strengthen the protections for all workers, especially those in low paid sectors or working atypical hours, on fixed term contracts or working part time.

• the introduction of a social progress clause into the eu treaties in order to ensure that fundamental social rights and collective agreements on pay and conditions take precedence over the freedom of the markets.

• social clauses in procurement contracts to ensure a community dividend, particularly in areas of high unemployment, from public and private investment.

• all eu funding programmes to have an explicit and target driven role in promoting equality and social inclusion on grounds including gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and social class

5. Supporting those out of work

The eu jobs crisis was not an accident of nature. Policies pursued in brussels and supported across the member states created the crisis. In turn, measures introduced by the eu to help those out of work have been tokenistic, punitive, and often poorly implemented.

These initiatives have also been undermined by austerity policies pursued by the commission, particularly as part of the troika programmes in greece, portugal, cyprus and ireland.

The european globalisation adjustment fund is a case in point. The purpose of the fund was to provide supports for workers made redundant as a result of the relocation of jobs due to globalisation. It was subsequently expanded to include sectors of workers disproportionately affected by the recession. However, both its scope and its implementation left hundreds of thousands of workers across the eu short-changed. Since 2009 the fianna fáil/green party and then fine gael/labour governments have made five applications to the fund. The total amount provided to the state was €24.8 million to assist workers from dell, sr technics, waterford crystal, talk talk and the construction sector retrain and increase their employability. No applications have been made by the british government for redundant workers in the north.

To date almost 50% of this funding has been returned to the european commission because of a failure of both the fianna fáil green party government and their fine gael labour party successors to properly manage the money.

Not only has government mismanagement resulted in the return of millions of euros back to brussels, but the money that was spent was used to provide supports that the redundant workers would have had access to anyway, rather than to provide the additional tailored supports as intended by the programme.

While in the first instance the blame for this fiasco in the 26 counties must rest with the government, the commission has also failed to adequately monitor this programme.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• greater eu supports for people out of work including an expanded and reformed european globalisation adjustment fund.

• a real youth guarantee fund of €21bn to tackle the youth unemployment crisis – based on the funding model outlined by the international labour organisation and the national youth council of ireland.

• the right for the assembly to apply to the egaf for workers affected in the north.

• eu support for social clauses in public and private contracts targeting the unemployed and those recently completed education or training.

6. Dealing with the debt 

Irish taxpayers have poured an astonishing €65 billion into the failed banks that caused the financial crisis. The most expensive bank bailout in history has cost every man, woman and child in the state €13,956. No other eu or eurozone country has imposed such a heavy cost on its citizens.

The decision to bailout the banks at any cost has cost us 3 times more than iceland’s bailout, 4 times more than greece’s bailout, 10 times more than the spanish bailout, 23 times more than the portuguese bailout and 198 times more than the italian bailout.

By any measure the people of the 26 counties have shouldered more than their fair share. The banking crisis was as much european as it was irish.

In july 2012 the european council promised to break the link between sovereign debt and private banking debt. Yet today we continue to pay the costs of the banking crisis. Fine gael and labour’s much hyped 2013 promissory note deal has foisted a huge portion of this debt onto future generations.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt.

• the retrospective recapitalisation of aib and bank of ireland.

• a new deal on the promissory note lifting this odious debt from our children and grandchildren.

• a banking supervisory mechanism that makes banks pay their fair share of any future crisis.

7. Reforming the eu institutions

Public confidence in eu institutions is at an all-time low. According to eurobarometer – the eus official polling body - public trust in the eu institutions has halved since before the crisis.

Peripheral member states are bearing the brunt of unemployment, emigration and poverty. Low and middle income families, smes and family farmers are struggling to survive while the very wealthy and large corporations benefit.

Eu leaders and eu institutions have demonstrated beyond doubt that they are not capable of resolving the economic and social crisis caused by their policies.

The eu’s democratic deficit and calls for institutional reform are not new. However the crisis has exposed a more fundamental political crisis which urgently needs to be addressed.

Successive waves of treaty change from maastricht to lisbon have made matters worse not better.

The commission has too much power. The council is shrouded in secrecy. Larger member states have disproportionate influence in the council.

This has to change. The eu needs to be streamlined; it needs to focus on its core functions; its needs less power not more.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• an eu convention to engage in and open public debate, with an explicit mandate to identify competencies to be returned to member states as contained in the laeken declaration.

• reducing the power of the commission by ending its right to propose legislation without being requested to do so by the council or parliament.

• lifting the secrecy surrounding the european council by holding public meetings and providing full minutes.

• increasing the power of smaller member states by reforming the operation of qualified majority voting.

• increasing the number of meps elected from smaller member states.

• strengthening the ability of individual member state parliaments to influence legislative proposals.

• reducing the influence of corporate lobbyists in brussels.

• maintaining one commissioner per member state and making that commissioner accountable to the parliament of that member state through a process of approval by, and regular reporting back to, member state parliaments.

8. A better deal for rural & coastal ireland

The common agricultural policy is an important protection for farmers. It helps sustain rural communities and promotes jobs and families.

The reformed cap is a compromise between 28 member states; no member state achieved everything that they wanted for their agriculture sector.

Sinn fein argued for a well-funded cap and opposed the cuts proposed by britain and others in the eu, cuts supported by northern unionists.

Sinn féin supported the compromise. But we have continued to argue for greater flexibility in terms of its implementation by each member state.

The focus has now shifted on to member states and meps have a role in ensuring that the implementation of the new cap regime is fair and provides security to all our farming communities.

Historically cap has favoured a small minority of recipients who received the lion’s share of the single farm payment without having any greater productivity than those on lower payments.

We also want to see a reform of the inspection regime to ensure that the right balance is struck between ensuring compliance and the levels of administration required of farmers.

We need a better deal for all of rural ireland. It is vital therefore that implementation of the new cap regime includes a significant redistribution of funds towards the majority of farmers, many of whom are struggling to maintain a viable income.

Sinn féin supports the move towards a flat rate of payment for small farming families and wants to see it implemented preferably by 2015.

In terms of common fisheries policy sinn fein supported greater regionalisation and local decision making over fishing effort. Sinn fein wants to see a thriving sustainable fishing industry with greater opportunities for our fishermen in irish waters.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• a fairer distribution of agricultural supports to smaller struggling family farms.
• a move to a flat rate of single farm payment with greater support for the disadvantaged areas.
• a properly funded agri-environmental scheme to compensate farmers in disadvantaged and designated areas.
• the six counties to be treated as one region in terms of single farm payments.
• implementation of the growing for growth strategy creating 15,000 new jobs and levering in 1.4 billion in private sector investment.
• maximum regionalisation under common fisheries policy to bring greater local control over decision making on irish fishing effort.
• greater support for our fishermen to assist them with the increasing costs of fishing including a single boat payment in recognition of fishing as a primary producer.

9. Protecting the environment and promoting public health

Never before has the case for sustainable economic and ecological development been so clear. Climate change is an established fact. Our environment and biodiversity continue to be eroded by over reliance on fossil fuels, corporate pollution and unsound waste policies.

Despite this the last decade has seen a reduction in the number of environmental initiatives by the eu. There has also been a shift in policy focus from strict targets and limits in eu directives and a greater focus on ‘incentivising’ good corporate behaviour. Successive governments in the south of ireland have been among the poorest in europe in implementing eu environmental directives. This has led to an excessively high number of enforcement actions taken by the european commission. It has also undermined the process of implementation in a manner that would address the concerns of various interest groups.

This is most recently evident on the issue of turf cutting. Sinn féin supports the habitats directive and wants to see it transposed fully. However we also believe that rural dwellers tradition of sustainable turf cutting can be accommodated within the directive. Bad implementation by government has created an unnecessary standoff. Climate change is another area where government has failed to act. The european union is in the process of setting its climate targets for the next two decades. This will shape europe’s carbon emissions and renewable energy development until 2030. Sinn féin strongly believes that the eu must take on its fair share of the global effort to keep temperature rise well below 2°c.

Adopting ambitious, legally binding targets to curb greenhouse gases and stimulate energy efficiency and renewable energy will be essential if the eu is to play its part in combating climate change.

A strong eu 2030 package will ensure we bring a robust and united position to the summit in september 2014.

Sinn féin has argued that domestic climate change legislation must contain legally binding 5 year carbon budgets, an independent expert authority to advise and make recommendations to governments and a science based target for 2050.

Global environmental change does not respect borders. We have a single interconnected energy market. As an island it makes sense to promote all ireland environmental protection and energy policy. The island of ireland, with its exposure to wind and tidal energy, is well placed to utilise natural resources for the benefit of our people the eu needs to re-establish itself as a global leader in environmental practice and the irish government and the assembly must be more proactive in the setting of the policy agenda.

Central to this effort must be a shift in investment strategies in support of technologies that promote sustainable environmental development. Despite the talk of a green new deal very little in the way of actually deliver has materialised.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• urgent action on climate change with binding eu targets, including an eu net carbon account for the year 2050, at least 80 per cent lower than the 1990 baseline and an overall target reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 of between 20 to 30%.
• greater investment in renewable energy, improved regulation of wind farms and increased investment in wave and other energy sources.
• an eu wide ban on hydraulic fracturing (fracking).
• a review of the special areas of conservation to ensure full transposition of the habitats directive while allowing rural dwellers to continue the tradition of sustainable turf cutting.
• eu support for expanding ireland’s natural environment such as the liffey valley park.
• the withdrawal of local and central government support for the poolbeg incinerator.

10. Promoting public health

Whilst health is a competence for member state’s there are various initiatives at a european level where sinn féin meps can work to improve and promote public health and the wellbeing of our citizens.

Every year in ireland, 7000 people die from tobacco-related diseases. Deaths from lung cancer for irish women are the 4th highest in the eu and lung cancer is the most common cancer for both sexes.

Measures to reduce the attractiveness of cigarettes and other tobacco products must therefore be prioritised to stop generations of young people and children starting to smoke. Sinn féin will build upon work done on european legislation such as the tobacco products directive to ensure that this issue continues to be highlighted at a european level.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• stronger tobacco control measures to reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products, especially to young people.

11. Balanced regional development

Sinn féin recognises the added value a well-resourced and properly focussed structural funds programme can have in helping ireland, north and south, make real and sustainable recovery. Sinn féin has always prioritised regional development through membership of the eu parliament’s’ regional development committee. Ireland has benefited from structural funds down through the years. This expertise and knowledge should be harnessed fully to ensure the next round of funding is equally beneficial.

The structural funds should represent genuine added value and not be used to substitute for services and infrastructure the government should be providing anyway. We will campaign for structural funds to be focussed on reducing poverty and regional imbalances, building cross-border links to reduce the impact of partition and improving our social and physical infrastructure.

The weakening of the social elements of the eu’s regional policy has been on-going for more than a decade now. Sinn fein has opposed this dilution in brussels, strasbourg and on the ground at home.

We have vocally opposed the latest dilution through the “macro-economic conditionality” clause. This clause would allow the eu to stop funds like peace and the proposed youth guarantee in ireland because of the new austerity rules. This is akin to kicking ireland or any other country when they are down. The government say they are opposed to macro-economic conditionality but did not raise their voice against it when it mattered.

We have also opposed cuts to structural funds and peace funds.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• a fair and properly resourced regional development policy based on solidarity between regions.
• a peace iv which makes a real difference to peace building and is based on objective need.
• the maximum all-ireland cooperation on planning in the spending of funds.
• a social and environmental emphasis above competitiveness and other considerations in the design and implementation of ireland’s operational programmes and regional plans.
• the right of the assembly to draw down structural funds directly from the eu.
• maximise the opportunity to drawn down additional eu competitive funds.

12. Promoting irish unity

The eu has a role to play in peace building and supporting the implementation of the good friday agreement. This agreement provides for a border poll to determine the continued partition or reunification of ireland. The eu should continue to play a role in supporting the peace process, promoting cross border working and ultimately respecting and supporting any vote for reunification.

Partition fractured the economy of ireland. There are no advantages for an island nation of 6.4 million people on the edge of europe having two separate tax regimes, two currencies and legal systems, two public service systems and two separate competing economies.

The social, economic, political and cultural divisions that have become symptoms of partition have caused cross-border divergence that has resulted in almost a century of instability and conflict across the island. Partition has undermined economic development, particularly in border areas.

Harmonising structures across the island is central to creating a fully integrated and healthy economy and public services.

The border hampers trade, undermines workers’ rights and restricts economic growth. Many successful businesses face the added cost of cross border trade and barriers to expansion.

Councils along the border provide back to back services that could be provided in a more efficient an effective manner through cross border working between councils. Economic co-operation and co-ordination of trade, investment and progressive taxation could play a central role in securing a just, fair and healthy economy for the island as a whole. The starting point must be for maximum fiscal powers to be transferred to the north.

We have disconnected public service, programmes and centres of excellence. It has been illustrated that where joint enterprise is applied, such as in health, it makes economic sense.

The treaties of the european union oblige it to promote cross-border integration and to help overcome the negative effects of partition in ireland.

There are a number of steps which the eu could advance including:

• encouraging the development of integrated irish representation on eu issues.
• providing for the participation of ministers from the northern executive in the council of ministers.
• providing for the possibility of an ‘opt-in’ to eu legislation by the six counties where the british government has opted-out, in order to ensure that the whole island is operating within the same social and economic framework.
• developing a single eu support framework to ensure that strategic planning can take place on an all-ireland basis and that the eu can treat ireland as a single entity for funding purposes.
• promoting additional draw down of interreg funding.
• giving cross-border corridor groups a more strategic role in the allocation and distribution of funds.
• supporting the development of all-ireland public sector and civil society institutions and contributing to the establishment of cross-border economic development zones.
• exempting state aid to support irish integration and reunification from competition regulations
• systematically analysing the costs of continued partition as part of its contribution to an open, inclusive, informed and respectful debate on the benefits of irish unity.
• insisting that the good friday agreement be fully implemented by the british and irish governments.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• adequate funding and political support for the peace programme.
• a stronger all-ireland dynamic to eu funding.
• putting equality, social inclusion and sustainable development at the heart of eu funding regulations.
• additional eu funding for ireland in order to promote cross-border integration.

13. Reclaiming irish neutrality

The lisbon treaty gave the eu significant new powers to further develop common defence, security and foreign policies. While the economic crisis has slowed down the speed and depth of eu integration in these areas, they none the less continue to represent a serious threat to irish neutrality and sovereignty.

Sinn féin believes in positive neutrality. We are opposed to irish membership in any military alliance or common defence. We are also concerned with the increasing militarisation of the eu and the impact of the eu arms industry in conflict zones across the world.

14. Promoting human rights

Sinn féin supports the european human rights architecture and the objective of continent-wide upwards harmonisation of protections, because they serve the best interest of the irish people. We will insist that ireland upholds these human rights standards at home, and that the eu institutions also live up to their own human rights commitments.

European human rights guarantees are not enough. We need stronger domestic protections in ireland, starting with full implementation of the outstanding human rights commitments under the good friday agreement.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• a specific protocol attached to the eu treaties on irish neutrality similar to that secured by denmark.
• an end to irish participation in the evolving eu common defence and security policies.
• a ban on the export of eu manufactured arms to countries in conflict.
• an end to the linking of eu development aid and security policy.

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:

• ireland to fully comply with all european human rights obligations, whether civil or political, under the echr or economic and social rights under the european social charter.
• ireland to fully comply with its obligations under the eu charter of fundamental rights in the domestic implementation of eu law.
• the british government to fully comply with its obligations under the european charter for regional or minority languages with respect to the irish language.
• eu support for westminster legislating for a robust and enforceable bill of rights for the north – including economic, social and cultural rights – as provided for under the terms of the good friday agreement.
• eu support for the oireachtas legislating for improved constitutional protection of human rights – including in particular economic, social and cultural rights – as provided for under the terms of the good friday agreement.
• eu support for the adoption of an all-ireland charter of rights to harmonise guarantees, as provided for under the terms of the good friday agreement.
• argue for effective and consistent implementation of the eu guidelines on human rights defenders by the european external action services (eeas) in eu missions around the world
• argue that human rights are taken into consideration in all policy areas within the eu including international trade agreements.
• argue that social & environmental impact assessments are carried out on proposals in the

15. Promoting irish at home and in the eu
Sinn féin has always argued that the european union has an important role to play in the promotion of irish language and culture. The recognition of irish as an official language of the eu, which sinn féin campaigned hard for, was an important achievement.

However the temporary derogation put in place in 2007 had meant that potential of this achievement has not been fully realised.

The derogation is due to end on the 31st of december 2016. However it could be brought to an end sooner and full recognition for irish could be in place. The ending of this derogation would provide 180 jobs in the eu institutions for irish language speakers for jobs such as interpreters, translators, lawyer-linguists

Sinn féin meps will campaign for:
• the irish government to apply to the european council to put an end to the derogation.
• increased investment by the irish government to ensure that we have a skilled workforce of translators, interpreters and lawyer-linguists to supply the increased positions arising from the end of the derogation.
• maintenance of official recognition and status for irish in the EU.",2014,"EP","Sinn Fein","Sinn Fein_2014_EP"
"Local 2014: Fine Gael","Introduction

In 2011, fine gael stood alone as the only political party to promise not to increase income taxes on you and other hard working families.

We made you that promise because hitting people at work with even more penal taxes, like the previous government’s usc, would have made it impossible for us to stop the disastrous collapse in employment, incomes and investment presided over by fianna fáil.

Supporting people to go to work was the central part of our recovery plan.

In government fine gael has kept its promise. While people have made a lot of sacrifices as we fixed the public finances, the government has not increased taxes on income and work.

The resilience shown by the irish people is now bearing fruit. From the situation under fianna fail where ireland was losing on average 1,600 jobs per week, irish businesses – big and small – are now creating over 1,000 jobs per week.

This is not enough. Too many people are still being forced to leave the country to look for work, and too many families and communities across the country have not felt any lift in their own personal circumstances.

The local elections provide people with an important opportunity to spread the benefits of the economic recovery into every town and parish.

Fine gael wants to make the recovery local.

That’s why every fine gael candidate in the local elections has committed to the “three steps to local recovery” contained in the fine gael local election manifesto.

First, fine gael councillors will not vote for an increase in the local property tax rate where they have discretion and will cut the local property tax rate where circumstances allow. Other parties are promising to increase council spending, which you will have to pay for through a higher property tax. As with your income taxes, only fine gael can be trusted to manage your local government finances and keep your local property tax rate low.

Secondly, during the harmonisation process of commercial rates, fine gael councillors will ensure that there will be no increase in commercial rates and will reduce rates where possible, as part of a “jobs and small business package” in every council budget. This package will also commit to a 20% increase in funding and a doubling of staff available to work in the new local enterprise offices which are now being established to support local entrepreneurs and small businesses; and a doubling of the number of ‘gateway’ work places for local long term unemployed people.

Thirdly, fine gael councillors will vote to sell social housing to tenants at an attractive discount. Fine gael supports home ownership because it is good for community stability, individual empowerment and local employment. Other parties are opposed to selling social housing. We will use the proceeds from the sales to reinvest in new social housing and to free up resources for new investment in parks, playgrounds and other local facilities so that all the community can benefit. Proceeds will also help social housing solutions such as refurbishments and improvements to existing social houses, bringing long-term vacant units back into social use, and targeting completion of unfinished housing estates.

A new model of local government

After the local elections, we will have a new system of local government in ireland. Your vote matters more than ever on 23rd may because councillors will soon have more powers and citizens will have a stronger voice in every aspect of council business.

The new system of local government, introduced by minister hogan, will be leaner and more streamlined:

• the number of councils will be reduced by almost three quarters from 118 to just 31 after the next local elections;
• the number of councillors will be reduced by 40% from over 1,600 to 950; and
• the number of council staff has already been reduced by almost 25% since 2008 and will be further reduced in the years ahead as part of the reforms.
• the structural reforms introduced by this government will deliver savings of between €40 - €45 million.

The new local government reforms will facilitate better engagement with the citizen, more transparency and greater accountability. As a citizen, you have the right to know the impacts of the decisions made by your council, the level of services it provides and the cost of delivering those services.

Each council will be carefully monitored and benchmarked against performance indicators by a new national oversight and audit committee. Performance reports will be published and they will show how well services are provided by the council, how well they meet needs, how targets set have been achieved, how the council performed compared to other councils, and how each council is improving its level of service year-on-year.

Fine gael will ensure there is maximum transparency as to how the local property tax (lpt) revenue is used in your local area. Elected members at the new municipal district level will decide, through a schedule of works as an integral part of the budget process, on the priority projects to be carried out. Local people will therefore have the opportunity to get more involved in the debate with their local elected members about how their local property tax is being spent.

Fully-costed annual service plans, which will include a comprehensive range of targets, will be approved by elected members in respect of each programme area (e.g. Housing, economic development, roads, etc.) In parallel with the budgetary process. The role of council strategic policy committees will be expanded to include monitoring of the service plans, with a focus on efficiency and value for money.

Your council will put in place a new citizens’ charter to provide a commitment to you on the level of service they can expect to receive when dealing with their council.

Fine gael believes that a transparent and ethical model of local government is essential. Therefore, a new code of ethics will be introduced for local government, in the context of the examination currently being undertaken of the legislative frameworks for ethics across the public service.

Jobs, enterprise, infrastructure

Fine gael believes that a tax on income is a tax on jobs. In government, we have prevented any increases in income tax and we will endeavour to reduce the burden on taxpayers as the recovery gains momentum. The annual action plan for jobs is focussed on improving supports for irish businesses and removing the barriers to employment-creation across the country.

Our jobs strategy is working. In the three years before fine gael entered government our country was shedding circa 1,600 jobs each week; we are now increasing jobs by over 1,000 each week. But fine gael wants to improve on the recent employment figures by increasing the pace of jobs growth.

We hope to achieve this by supplementing national schemes with a number of locally-led initiatives such as a county based youth entrepreneurship competitive start programme and the gateway initiative.

From mid-2014 your council will play a more active role in economic development. Fine gael believes councillors are uniquely placed, through their local knowledge and links with enterprise, to drive economic initiatives. One of the key new reforms in this regard is the establishment of first stop shop ‘local enterprise offices’ (leos).

1: a first stop shop for local businesses: the leo

Fine gael councillors will improve the support services for small and medium businesses by facilitiating the roll out of the new network of 31 local enterprise offices (leos) by the end of 2014. Leos are a merger of the business support unit of each council with the relevant county enterprise board creating a “first stop shop” for local entrepreneurs, delivered by enterprise ireland.

The leo is a new initiative led by minister bruton and minister hogan and requires strong backing from elected members to become operational and to deliver to local businesses in your area.

Fine gael councillors will prioritise the establishment of a first class leo in your area, demanding the transfer of all business support unit staff into the leo along with any necessary additional staffing.

Fine gael councillors will demand ambitous performance targets from their leo including published targets for job creation, start-ups supported, grants approved, training initiatives delivered etc.

Fine gael councillors will drive implementation of this key reform, demanding an annual enterprise plan from each council that will underpin the enterprise ambitions of the council area.

Among the improved services for local businesses will be:
• access to a single point of application through the leo for a range of enterprise supports. One evaluation committee will decide on the most appropriate grant support for the applicant business cutting down on paperwork.
• seamless access to enterprise ireland supports where there is potential to grow jobs and exports.
• information, advice and access to a range of services and supports e.g. Microfinance ireland loan fund; credit review office; companies registration office; revenue and department of social protection schemes; solas and skillnets training; other local funding streams e.g. Leader.
• advice on planning, rates, licences, procurement and other council services
• mentoring programmes overseen by enterprise ireland.
• companies with over 10 employees operating exclusively in the domestic market, which currently in most cases are not supported by the state, will be eligible for supports under the new system.
• access to the range of support services – including planning and licensing – offered by councils.

2: revitalising the main street

Fine gael councillors will introduce measures to revitalise the main street.

Commercial rates

During the harmonisation process of commercial rates, fine gael councillors will ensure that there will be no increase in commercial rates and will reduce rates where possible. This means that there will be no additional burden placed on the business community to fund local government.

From 2014 a single annual rate on valuation (arv) will apply across each new council area, replacing the old system of multiple commercial rates. Harmonisation of rates will mean a level playing field for the first time for all businesses within the same council area, so that those located on the outskirts of the town will pay the same rate as those located in the town.

Ahead of the formal merger of limerick county and city council, and waterford county and city council, the councils have successfully harmonised their commercial rates to the lowest level in each case as a result of efficiency savings from local government reforms.

This will complement the new more efficient valuation system being introduced at national level which involves a range of measures including a streamlining of appeals procedures available to ratepayers and increased self-assessment.

Cutting the cost of local government

Fine gael will aggressively drive cost savings through the local government efficiency review, building on the €839 million saved over the last six years. Savings in future will be passed on to local businesses, particularly in the area of commercial rates.

To renew trust and confidence among citizens in the local government system, service plan implementation will be monitored by the council’s strategic policy committees (spcs) and each council’s finances and performance will be monitored annually by a national oversight and audit commission.

A new code of ethics will be introduced for local government which will include a review of expenses paid to councillors.

Vacant premises

Under minister hogan’s reforms, councillors will have the power for the first time to decide on the level of incentive to levy on landlords in the case of vacant premises. Councillors can decide on a rate of up to 50% of the original rates bill. Fine gael councillors will use this power to incentivise landlords to lease vacant properties in appropriate circumstances.

The government has removed the subsequent occupier liability, whereby new tenants had to pay up to two years’ unpaid commercial rates accrued by the previous occupier. This measure will eliminate the financial burden for new occupiers, and ensure that property that may have otherwise remained vacant and unoccupied can now be re-let.

Encouraging new house building in urban areas

The collapse of the housing market and the construction industry has essentially ceased the output of new housing in the dublin area which is causing an acute shortage of new family homes. However, there are still many sites within the dublin area that could be used for construction of new family homes.

New development often requires infrastructural investment and that investment has to be paid for. Development contributions have played, and will continue to play, an important role in enabling capital investment by councils in transport, community facilities, amenities and cultural facilities.

The impact of the recession has resulted in substantial reductions in development contributions, with dublin’s councils, for example, reducing their contributions for new planning applications by 26%.

However, it has not been possible thus far for the holders of existing planning permissions to avail of these reduced contribution levies without revisiting the planning process.

Fine gael councillors will therefore support measures to ensure that current arrangements are amended to provide that lower rates of contributions can have retrospective effect for existing planning permissions that have yet to be activated.

To kick-start the construction of new housing in dublin, fine gael councillors will review the published development contributions schemes with a view to providing reductions of a minimum of 25% of the published scheme rate. The revised discounts will apply to future projects that have obtained planning permission by the end of 2015, provided that development commences by the end of 2015 and is completed by mid-2016.

As a further measure to promote urban regeneration of brownfield sites and to help bring life back into many parts of our urban areas, fine gael councillors will also support the reduction in development contributions of a minimum of 50% of the published scheme rate for a defined period of time where the council is seeking to promote significant regeneration in city and town centre areas.

Built heritage jobs leverage scheme

Historic structures are an important part of the community’s heritage as well as providing a tourist focus and an aesthetic focal point in the area. The built heritage jobs leverage scheme is designed to help fund conservation by providing half the funding required, i.e. Successful applicants have to match the funding awarded with the same amount from private or fundraised sources.

Administration of this scheme is the responsibility of local councils. Fine gael councillors will ensure the implementation and success of the built heritage jobs leverage scheme and enhance the scheme where necessary, increasing its potential to become a permanent part of our conservation agenda.

3: growing the regional and local economy

With the creation of leos and the reform of local government, councillors now have a strong role to play in driving economic development locally. There are now new opportunities for regional linkages which would see a number of councils coming together to cooperate on an initiative in their region. The advantage of a regional approach is evident through the successful south east employment action plan pioneered by minister richard bruton.

Fine gael councillors will work across council boundaries to maximise regional development potential in line with the new government strategy of regional development.

(i) regional enterprise strategy fine gael will develop a new framework for a regional enterprise strategy to better integrate the efforts of enterprise agencies and the other regional stakeholders to grow employment in locally companies based on the sustainable competitive advantage of the region.

The intention is to develop a suite of regional actions and regional policy tools that promote innovation and collaboration across the network of leos and councils with the aim of creating sustainable local jobs.

(ii) county based youth entrepreneurship competitive start programme fine gael councillors will fast-track implementation of minister bruton’s proposal to introduce an enterprise ireland competitive start programme through the leo network which identifies the best young entrepreneur in the county to compete in regional and national competitions. Key criteria of this proposal include job creation potential, relevance to the local area, adoption of new technologies and the capacity to scale and grow exports.

It is expected that an additional allocation of €2 million in capital funding will be provided for a youth entrepreneur start-up call. Each leo will have a specific fund to award to the best three young entrepreneurs in their area with a final additional award for regional winner and ultimately a national winner.

4: tackling unemployment at local level

Your council has a key role to play in providing opportunities for unemployed people to access the labour market. As economic recovery continues, fine gael councillors will fight to ensure that households in their communities are not left behind. Your council can provide opportunities for retraining, up-skilling and valuable work experience. The new ‘gateway’ initiative seeks to emulate the success of jobbridge which has already provided over 27,000 placements to social welfare recipients, of which over 60% are moving into full-time jobs.

The gateway scheme

The new ‘gateway’ initiative—a council work placement scheme—will provide over 3,000 local work placements for people who have been on the live register for two years or more by the end of 2014.

The work programmes will cover the full spectrum of services areas across the council and the work placement opportunities will range from general operative work (e.g. Parks, environment, roads, etc.), through specialist roles (e.g. Dog warden assistants, sports instructors, ambassadors at tourist attractions, etc.), to back office clerical and it support.

Fine gael councillors will demand a doubling of places nationally to develop a number of flagship projects, in particular local tourism and recreation infrastructure, including cycleways, walkways and waterways.

5: meeting local transport needs

Fine gael believes that decision-making on transport should take place on a local rather than a national level to the greatest extent possible.

Roads

Minister varadkar is giving councils greater discretion in respect of their expenditure on local and regional roads. Fine gael councillors will prioritise maintenance and upkeep of the existing road network in the first instance rather than the planning and design of possible new roads.

Fine gael councillors will exercise the greater discretion being given to councils in respect of speed limits to prioritise sensible, safe speed limits and take account of local circumstances including, for example, the presence of schools.

Ports

Responsibility for the ports of galway, wicklow, drogheda, new ross and dun laoghaire will be transferred to councils shortly. Fine gael councillors will ensure that these ports are integrated into local planning and that their full potential as a local amenity and a regional transport hub is fully realised, along with their tourism potential.

The rural transport programme

The rural transport programme (rtp) is an important local service, particularly for those who do not own cars. It is a bulwark against rural isolation. This government is placing the rtp on a more secure footing and we are determined to maintain and expand the programme into the future.

The councillors that you elect will play a role in new rtp structures called transport coordination units (tcus), working alongside the national transport authority (nta) and transport providers. Fine gael will prioritise integration of the school transport and hse transport networks with the rtp so that all of our publicly-funded buses are used to maximum efficiency.

Cycleways & greenways

Councils are the key enablers of ‘greenways’ - cycle routes along disused railways lines or canals. Routes such as the great western greenway have proven extremely successful attracting high tourist numbers and leisure use.

In many cases, council leadership is crucial to the creation of greenways. Fine gael councillors will tackle the unacceptable delays in progressing the introduction of cycleways in communities around the country so that the success of the great western greenway can be replicated.

Rollout of public bike schemes

Fine gael councillors are championing the extension of the hugely successful dublin bikes scheme to new parts of dublin and to cities around ireland.

Public bikes are environmentally friendly, enhance and link-up the existing transport network, promote healthy living, are popular with tourists and save money for the state and citizen. In dublin there have been over six million rentals since the introduction of the scheme.

Fine gael councillors across dublin, limerick, cork and galway will drive the roll out and extension of the bikes scheme.

6: new opportunities for local tourism

Building on the success of ‘the gathering’

Fine gael councillors will ensure that within each council there is a dedicated fund for tourism development, as well as a separate fund to support local events and festivals that have the ability to bring in overseas visitors.

The very successful gathering initiative, led by ministers varadkar and ring demonstrated the crucial role of councils in tourism. The success of the gathering was built on local buy-in and with over 5,000 events around the country, many small towns and villages realised a previously untapped tourism potential. During the year of the gathering, visitor numbers increased by more than 7% nationally while extensive training was provided to more than 2,500 people in communities across the country.

The government is currently working on a new tourism policy and improving and streamlining the role of councils and their members in tourism is a crucial issue in this review. Councils are responsible for co-ordinating tourist activity locally, supporting tourism product development and fostering a pro-tourism culture within communities.

Fine gael councillors will build on the success of the gathering by developing the legacy of networks it has created and continuing to invest in tourism infrastructure. This will involve fine gael councillors, through the strategic policy committees, placing a strong emphasis on tourism as part of their economic planning within their areas.

Fine gael councillors will work to promote local tourist attractions and ensure accessibility.

7: funding for community projects

Every year local communities receive significant funding under the “leader” programme, which is financed by the eu and the government to provide for rural development programmes. The next round of leader funding 2014-2020 will continue to be based on the ‘bottom-up’ approach to delivery. However, recent changes introduced by minister hogan will provide for better alignment with the council, which in turn provides for better accountability on what projects are funded in local communities and gives councillors a greater say.

Councillors are your local representatives; they, along with community interests, are your voice when decisions are being made on matters such as the allocation of leader funds. New local community development committees will see councillors and community interests coming together to prepare a local community plan – a strategic framework for all local and community development spend in the local area.

Elected members, through the new local community development committees (lcdcs), will have a greater input in the planning and oversight of local and community development spending, in the form of local community plans, which will detail the range of local and community projects and programmes to be funded in the locality including the leader rural development programme.

8: the rural economy

The introduction of local community development committees is a positive development for rural ireland. Fine gael councillors will ensure that the local community plans are aimed at improving the economic as well as social fabric of local communities. In particular, fine gael councillors will ensure that funding is prioritised for:

• labour market training to assist the unemployed find work,
• projects and programmes that increase economic activity and generate employment, including:
• speciality food and beverage;
• renewable energy;
• tourism initiatives, including destination management and marketing;
• creative industry businesses; and
• social enterprises.

A new cap and cfp

The nature of the reform of the common agricultural policy (cap) and common fisheries policy (cfp) in 2013 was certain to have a colossal impact on the rural economy. Under minister coveney’s leadership, a new cap and cfp were agreed in europe, with measures set to significantly benefit rural ireland in the coming years.

Common agricultural policy

More than €12.5 billion in common agricultural policy and exchequer funding will be allocated to the agriculture sector in the period to 2020 with €8.5 billion of eu funding in direct payments being complemented by a rural development fund of €1.9 billion in national funding and €2.2 billion in eu funding. This represents a very significant, strategic financial investment in the agri-food sector, and comes on top of the large commercial investments that have been made by major players in the sector in recent times and the very positive news from bord bia on the continuing rise in the value of agri-food exports in 2013.

To make the developing economic recovery felt in every locality, minister coveney is drafting a new rural development programme which will see more on-farm investment as we grow our indigenous food and drink industry to new heights.

Minister coveney’s focus is on the need to achieve smart, green growth, as envisaged in food harvest 2020. The package of measures contained in the new cap provides practical, targeted support that will help the sector to achieve its ambitions while meeting its climate change responsibilities.

The main areas targeted are:

• young farmers: 2% of the national ceiling will be allocated to young farmers;
• agri-environment: a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (glas) will be introduced;
• areas of natural constraint (formerly “disadvantaged areas”): €195 million per year has been allocated to support areas of natural constraint;
• incentives for on-farm capital investment: these include support for the expansion of the dairy sector following the abolition of milk quotas in 2015;
• improving the beef herd: ireland will have a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to €52 million per year.

Common fisheries policy

During the irish presidency of the council of the eu, minister coveney brokered a new eu common fisheries policy. The main achievements under the new common fisheries policy will be:

• to set quotas that fully respect scientific advice, leading to healthier fish stocks and higher quotas;
• discarding of fish stocks will no longer be allowed;
• a commitment to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas (e.g. The “irish box” off the south and west coast); and
• to retain ownership of fish quotas as a public asset, protecting the family owned fishing vessels around our coast.

Housing and living

9: minimising your local property tax (lpt)

Fine gael councillors recognise that the local property tax (lpt) is a financial burden on homeowners, though fairer and more progressive than the household charge and non-principal private residences charge introduced by the last fianna fáil-led government.

The government will ensure that by 2015 at least 80% of the lpt will be retained locally so that local taxes directly fund local services such as parks, libraries and services in a transparent and accountable way.

From 2015 councillors will have the ability to increase or lower the lpt rate by 15%. Fine gael councillors will not increase the lpt rate and will reduce the lpt rate where possible taking into account local county needs. We will ensure that no council will be worse off following these reforms. The law underpinning the local property tax will see a revaluation of property in 2016, this and the setting of a national rate will be a matter for government and the oireachtas in 2016.

10: social housing: new home ownership opportunities

Fine gael councillors will pioneer a new approach to the management of local housing needs through the council. The social housing waiting list backlog will be partly tackled through the introduction of the housing assistance payment (hap). This is one element of helping people to put down deeper roots in their communities; the second element is a new social housing tenant purchase scheme.

Assisting low-income families to purchase their own home fine gael councillors will ensure that your council avails of and robustly implements the new social housing tenant purchase scheme.

The scheme will assist low-income households put down long-term roots and help to build stable and integrated communities.

Purchase will be strictly confined to existing tenants and will not be available to investors or to any other individuals.

We will use the proceeds from the sales to reinvest in new social housing and to free up resources for new investment in parks, playgrounds and other local facilities so that all the community can benefit.

11: housing: healing the scars of the economic crash

Minister hogan has introduced a range of measures to address the huge burdens placed on people by poor planning and weak regulation during fianna fáil’s last period in power. The new pyrite remediation scheme offers solutions to those who find themselves with pyrite in their homes. Priory hall residents have also been offered a resolution framework. Minister hogan has introduced new building control regulations to give greater protection to home owners.

Significant progress has been made in tackling unfinished housing estates. Councils have a key role in resolving the difficulties associated with unfinished housing estates, one of the worst legacies of fianna fail’s era in power. In particular, councils determine the priority of unfinished housing estates to be dealt with through national programmes administered by the national co-ordinating committee on unfinished housing developments (ncc).

Under the public safety initiative for unfinished housing developments the department of environment, community and local government has made allocations totalling €4.46 million to 23 councils. In budget 2014 €10 million was allocated to the site resolution fund to incentivise resolution in cases where more progress is needed.

Since 2010 there has been a decrease of more than half of the number of unfinished developments.

Fine gael councillors will aggressively pursue the resolution of difficulties with the remaining unfinished developments around the state, prioritising the developments with residents.

12: tackling anti-social behaviour for peaceful community living

Residents should no longer have to feel intimidated by anti-social behaviour in their communities.

Fine gael will strengthen council estate management powers so that councils may issue a tenancy warning as a consequence of anti-social behaviour.

A tenancy warning relating to anti-social behaviour will set out the detrimental effect of the breach on the quality of life in the community, and if the breach continues the council may either apply to recover possession of the dwelling or apply to the district court for an excluding order against the household member concerned.

The council may take the tenancy warning into account for up to three years when considering whether or not to let or sell a dwelling to the household member who caused the breach.

The minister for environment, community and local government will have the power to make regulations requiring housing authorities to revise their existing tenancy agreements accordingly so that they can retrospectively notify their tenants of the new responsibilities.

In addition, fine gael councillors will work with joint policing committees to ensure that anti-social behaviour hotspots are dealt with by an garda síochána.

13: better waste management

The government’s waste policy is radically changing the way we view and deal with waste. The range of new regulatory measures include:

• the introduction of pricing structures that incentivise sustainable behaviour.
• new controls to ensure that rogue entities do not hold waste permits.
• the requirement that service providers put in place customer charters.

The new regime will benefit the consumer and business and help address current shortcomings, in particular the buildup of waste and illegal dumping especially in many of our urban areas.

Fine gael councillors will also use bye-law powers under the waste management act to further improve the management of waste. For example, these powers might include controlling the times when waste collection is permitted, to limit the impact of noise and health and safety risks to children that can be sometimes created in estates by overlapping waste collection services.

14: tackling a welfare trap & the housing list: hap

Fine gael councillors will be at the forefront of a new approach to local housing. A new payment, the ‘housing assistance payment’ (hap), is designed to address three problems associated with the traditional approach to social housing, namely:

• social housing waiting lists are unacceptably long.
• rent supplement has been identified as a ‘welfare trap’ as recipients lose their entitlement if they take up employment.
• responsibility for social housing is divided between the department of social protection - which administers the rent supplement scheme - and the council - which is responsible for managing the social housing list and the rental accommodation scheme (ras).

The housing assistance payment will address these problems in three main ways as follows:

First, hap applicants will source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and once they are accommodated they will be deemed to have their housing need met. Hap will help renters to bridge the gap between their rent and their ability to pay.

Secondly, housing assistance will no longer be based on employment status but rather on the income of the tenant and their ability to pay. Hap will therefore continue when a person enters the labour force thus removing employment traps.

Thirdly, the council will have overall responsibility for the hap scheme, therefore streamlining the service.

Hap will lead to a fundamental reconfiguration of the landscape of housing support in ireland, appropriately recognising different needs whilst allowing resources to be more effectively targeted to those needs. The rollout of the scheme nationally will also complement the social housing purchase tenant scheme.

Fine gael councillors have an instrumental role to play in ensuring the effective management of local housing needs; we will ensure that the hap scheme is implemented in every council as a matter of urgency.

15: developing local services for our children & young adults

Pre-school and early years services

Fine gael recognises the crucial importance of promoting and ensuring quality and high standards in preschool and early years services.

County and city childcare committees exist throughout the country and have played an important role in supporting local childcare services. As part of minister fitzgerald’s pre-school quality agenda, the role of county and city childcare committees will be further developed with greater linkages to councils.

Fine gael councillors will take on a more pro-active role in supporting the work of the county and city childcare committees, ensuring quality of preschool and early years services locally.

Since 2011 minister fitzgerald has provided €8.75 million in capital funding to develop and improve local preschool and early years services. Further funding of €3 million will be provided in 2014.

Supporting play and physical activity

The new national local authority play and recreation network brings together for the first time key council managers and staff responsible for the local delivery of play and recreation services for your community.

Fine gael councillors will develop and support the ‘national play day’ and ‘national recreation week’ initiatives and ensure your council draws down the maximum funding available under national schemes.

Through city and county development plans, fine gael councillors will identify, require and provide for the development of innovative play and recreation areas in residential areas including smaller, informal play areas in estates, within walking distance of houses.

In 2013 minister fitzgerald introduced a funding scheme to contribute on a 50:50 basis towards council playground developments. Further funding will be provided in 2014. Fine gael councillors will seek to maximise the drawdown of funding through ensuring that matching playground funding is provided in council budgets.

Supporting young people & youth services

Youth cafés offer young people a safe, alcohol free environment to ‘hang out’ in a dynamic local hub and can provide a range of services including mental health services, information and youth employment supports.

Minister fitzgerald has prioritised investment in youth cafés nationwide with €2.2 million having been invested since 2011, with further funding being provided in 2014 and subsequent years.

Fine gael councillors have been active in campaigning for the expansion of the youth café network and, following the next round of funding, will ensure the maximum draw down on this funding for their local communities.

Fine gael councillors will ensure that your council plays a more pro-active role in partnering with youth services to provide youth cafés and other youth service hubs.

Planning for child-friendly communities

Fine gael councillors, when adopting new city/county development plans and new local area plans, will seek to include policies and objectives to promote better planning for child-friendly communities, including provision of traffic-calmed residential areas, more informal play areas in residential areas and safe pedestrian/cycling routes to schools.

In addition, fine gael councillors will seek to include explicit objectives in their statutory land-use plans to give local effect to the objective of the 2013 national guidelines on local area planning to reduce the exposure of children to the promotion of fast food; through restricting the opening of new fast food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks.

Sports capital programme

The sports capital programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country. In particular, its objectives are to:
• assist voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies (ngbs) of sport, councils and in some cases education and training boards (etbs) and schools to develop high quality, safe, well-designed, sustainable facilities in appropriate locations and to provide appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation;
• prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and
• encourage the multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.

The sports capital programme was shut down by the previous government when the financial crisis hit. Minister ring secured funding for the re-launch of the scheme in 2012, which saw a record number of applications.

Minister ring’s recently announced 2014 sports capital programme will allocate €40 million in grants, which should see dressing rooms, flood lights and sports halls built and pitches drained. While not all clubs can be successful, fine gael believes clubs who have not yet been successful in the programme should get priority.

This €40 million in grants will also create construction and related jobs in communities around the country.

The sports capital programme will be complemented by the important work of the council in the area of sports. Each council has personnel responsible for promoting sport and recreation activities among all ages in the community facilitating and running a range of programmes in their local area. Fine gael councillors will ensure that sports and recreation is prioritised in the council’s work programmes so that this important community service is enhanced and developed further.

Cities, towns and countryside

16: fine gael’s agenda for cities and towns

Local property tax (lpt)

The government will ensure that by 2015 at least 80% of the lpt will be retained locally so that local taxes directly fund local services such as parks, libraries and services in a transparent and accountable way.

From 2015 councillors will have the ability to increase or lower the lpt rate by 15%. Fine gael councillors will not increase the locally decided lpt rate and will reduce the lpt rate where possible taking into account local county needs. We will ensure that no council will be worse off following these reforms.

Addressing urban housing needs

Fine gael councillors will:

• prioritise the refurbishment of vacant units to meet social housing demand.
• temporarily reduce development contributions to kick-start the construction of new housing in dublin and development of other urban brownfield sites.
• ensure the planning system responds to the need for family homes.
• implement the hap scheme to remove a welfare trap and reduce housing lists.
• prioritise the ending of long-term homelessness by 2016 by implementing the government’s homelessness policy statement (february 2013) which provides for a housing-led approach to homelessness as the primary policy response.

A better urban environment in our regional towns

Economic development has to balanced if we are to make the recovery local. The potential of our regional and county towns must be harnessed if their wider rural hinterlands are also to thrive.

The local government reforms introduced in 2014 will mean that more streamlined and stronger councils are now better placed to promote and co-ordinate economic activity.

Fine gael councillors will ensure that our towns are the main locus for development in the regions, providing for population growth, transport and key services such as education and health, while avoiding legacy issues such as unfinished housing estates that resulted from the excessive and inappropriate zoning of the ‘celtic tiger’ years.

Fine gael councillors will drive new initiatives to promote a better urban environment, including, joint initiatives with local businesses to improve town centres (as being piloted in dún laoghaire rathdown county council). Priority will be given to:
• designing inclusive and safe public spaces;
• tackling empty properties and brownfield sites;
• the needs of pedestrians and cyclists;
• promoting the use of public, less polluting and more energy efficient modes of transport; and
• giving local people a greater stake in the decision-making process of neighbourhood management.

Urban parks

Work activation schemes run by councils will provide an opportunity for valuable work experience while also delivering resources into the creation and maintenance of important public spaces, including parks, cycleways, walkways and waterways.

Play areas

Fine gael councillors will deliver a series of council play and recreation initiatives including play areas, particularly in residential areas and will identify further funding opportunities for smaller, informal play areas in estates, within walking distance of houses.

Flood defences fine gael councillors will prioritise investment in flood defences to protect our cities and towns from extreme weather.

Living cities

Fine gael will continue to promote initiatives such as the “living city” tax scheme which allows home buyers and commercial property buyers to apply for tax relief on the refurbishment of historic buildings. Minister noonan has approved the introduction of this scheme in dublin, cork, galway, limerick, waterford and kilkenny.

Revitalising the main street:
• commercial rates: during the period agreed by the council for the harmonisation of commercial rates, fine gael councillors will ensure that the commercial rate agreed at the outset will not be increased during that period, and they will reduce rates where possible so that there will be no additional burden placed on the business community to fund local government.
• vacant premises: fine gael councillors want to address the problem of vacant commercial premises in our towns and cities. Fine gael councillors will use changes to the rates rules to incentivise landlords to lease vacant premises; this will complement minister hogan’s decision to change the law to ensure that new tenants are no longer liable for the commercial rates arrears of previous tenants.
• clamping and parking: fine gael councillors will adopt a parking strategy to examine and address the impact of clamping and parking charges on city and town centre retailers. This will build on minister varadkar’s reform of clamping laws which involve minimum signage requirements, limits on fines and maximum clamp release periods and fees.

Changing estate & street names

The naming of estates and roads has become an issue for many homeowners in recent years as it is currently very difficult to amend names once they are registered.

In the spirit of devolution, the minister for environment will introduce new regulations as part of ongoing local government reforms to make it easier for residents to change the name of a street or locality by a simple majority of the registered electors.

Urban transport

As the area of highest population, dublin and the counties surrounding it require an integrated transport network which includes dart, luas, bus, bicycles and pedestrians and takes account of the wider commuter belt reaching into louth, meath, kildare and wicklow.

Fine gael councillors will work to deliver the greater dublin area cycle network project which proposes to increase the provision of on and off road cycle paths from 500km to 2,840 kms in the four dublin council areas as well as counties kildare, meath and wicklow.

Fine gael councillors are committed to a system of public transport that is as efficient and widespread as possible. Ten per cent of the public service obligation (pso) contracts held by dublin bus and bus éireann for the bus market will expire shortly and there will be a new competitive tendering process. This will deliver as good a service as we now have, or better, to commuters at a lower price to taxpayers.

Fine gael councillors will continue to prioritise bus lanes to improve the attractiveness of bus travel as an alternative to cars.

Fine gael will continue to invest in improved technology including real time passenger information, new travel apps, free wifi and the leap card to enhance services to transport users and increase efficiencies.

Building on the success of the gathering

The government is currently working on a new tourism policy and improving and streamlining the role of councils and their members in tourism is a crucial issue in this review.

Fine gael councillors will build on the success of the gathering by developing the legacy of networks it has created and continuing to invest in tourism infrastructure. This will involve fine gael councillors, through the strategic policy committees, placing a strong emphasis on tourism as part of their economic planning within their areas.

Fine gael councillors will work to promote local tourist attractions and ensure accessibility.

Fine gael councillors will ensure that within each council there is a dedicated fund for tourism development, as well as a separate fund to support local events and festivals that have the ability to bring in overseas visitors.

Dublin

Dublin mayor

Fine gael believes an executive mayor would be good for dublin and dubliners which would introduce a model of international best practice to the governance of our national capital.

Following on from lack of agreement between dublin local authorities we will develop alternative proposals for future consultation and action with dubliners.

Dublin transport projects the completion of the luas cross city project in an efficient manner is a crucial aspect of fine gael’s transport plan for dublin city.

Tourism in dublin

Fine gael is ambitious for tourism in dublin, believing that dublin has the potential to be amongst the leading european city destinations. However achieving this requires significant leadership from the four dublin councils, in conjunction with fáilte ireland, tourism ireland and the tourism industry.

Fine gael councillors will champion the development a collaborative funding model for the promotion of dublin overseas leveraging public and private funding sources.

Fine gael councillors will ensure that the existing work carried out by the dublin councils to bring and promote events across the city is enhanced and improved.

Fine gael councillors will develop a specific fund from across the four dublin councils to attract major international events to our capital city.

Urban village initiative

Dublin is comprised of a series of villages, each with its own character and identity.

A distinctive village ‘brand’ is important in fostering community spirit among residents and a vibrant business community that attracts visitors to the area.

Fine gael councillors will require the council to develop a ‘best practice’ model for urban villages which would guide community and business groups in coming together to promote their area as an attractive place to work, live and do business.

Fine gael councillors will promote an annual best urban village competition in their dublin council area.

‘silicon dock’: fine gael councillors will continue to develop the docklands as an ecosystem for the technology industry, delivering appropriate infrastructure and working in partnership with the local community, the ida and the dublin city council leo to cluster appropriate technological companies at ‘silicon dock’.

Irish shipping centre: fine gael will work to create a maritime services hub in dublin’s docklands modelled on the success of the ifsc.

17: fine gael’s rural agenda

Investing in the rural economy

New local community development committees are being established in your local council. Their role includes developing a local community plan.

Fine gael councillors will ensure that funding in these plans focuses on helping the unemployed find work along with projects and programmes that increase economic activity and generate employment, e.g. Speciality food and beverage projects.

A new common agriculture policy (cap)

The common agricultural policy programme negotiated by minister coveney in 2013 will see more than €12.5 billion in cap and exchequer funding will be allocated to the agriculture sector in the period to 2020 with €8.5 billion of eu funding in direct payments being complemented by a rural development fund of €1.9 billion in national funding and €2.2 billion in eu funding.

The main areas targeted under cap include: extra funding for young farmers; a new agri-environment scheme (glas); €195 million for areas of natural constraint; incentives for on-farm investment and a €52 million per annum investment in improving the irish beef herd.

A new common fisheries policy

During the irish presidency of the council of the eu, minister coveney brokered a new eu common fisheries policy (cfp).

The new cfp involves the end of discards; a commitment to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas (e.g. The “irish box” off the south and west coast); and a promise to retain ownership of fish quotas as a public asset, protecting the family owned fishing vessels around our coast.

Safer communities – the role of the jpc in tackling crime

Ensuring safe communities requires garda recruitment, more gardaí out from behind desks on the beat in the locality, new rostering to ensure garda power is concentrated where needed and a new approach to policing that is intelligence-led.

Fine gael is delivering in each of these areas with county councillors providing a critical voice through local joint policing committees (jpcs).

Garda recruitment recommenced in 2014; a reorganisation of the garda station network in 2012-2013 means that more gardaí are now out on the beat rather than behind desks in under-used stations; new rostering arrangements allows gardaí to better respond to community needs with rostering reflecting the times when extra policing is needed.

Minister shatter has prioritised new technology - including €9 million worth of new modern vehicles sanctioned in 2013 alone, making the gardaí better equipped to fight crime.

Cso figures are showing a downward trend in crime including burglary and robbery.

Fine gael councillors will continue to be a strong voice for your locality on the jpc – a forum which brings together representatives of the council with senior garda officers responsible for the policing of the local area along with representatives of the community and local oireachtas members to consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the local area.

Rural roads

Minister varadkar is giving councils greater discretion in respect of their expenditure on local and regional roads.

Fine gael councillors will prioritise the maintenance and upkeep of the existing road network in the first instance rather than the planning and design of possible new roads.

Fine gael councillors will exercise the greater discretion being given to councils in respect of speed limits to prioritise sensible, safe speed limits and take account of local circumstances such as the presence of schools.

The rural transport programme

The rural transport programme (rtp) is an important local service, particularly for those who do not own cars. It is an essential bulwark against rural isolation. This government is placing the rtp on a more secure footing and we are determined to maintain and expand the programme into the future.

The councillors that you elect will play a role in new rtp structures called transport coordination units (tcus), working alongside the national transport authority (nta) and transport providers. Fine gael will prioritise integration of the school transport and hse transport networks with the rtp so that all of our publicly-funded buses are used to maximum efficiency.

Cycleways & greenways

Councils are the key enablers of ‘greenways’ - cycle routes along disused railways lines or canals. Routes such as the great western greenway have proven extremely successful attracting high tourist numbers and leisure use, boosting the rural economy.

In many cases, council leadership is crucial to the creation of greenways. Fine gael councillors will tackle the unacceptable delays in progressing the introduction of cycleways in communities around the country so that the success of the great western greenway can be replicated.

Hospital groups: protecting local hospital services

Six hospital groups are being established around the country. In each group smaller hospitals will be linked to large hospitals, securing their future. More patients will be treated in small hospitals which will do more work in a large number of areas including day surgery, diagnostics, rehabilitation and chronic disease management. This will allow the larger hospitals to focus on the medical procedures that only they can do and reduce waiting times for patients.

The introduction of primary care centres is delivering a one-stop-shop to communities by providing a range of health under one roof, e.g. Gp services, dental services, community mental health services etc. Since may 2011, 32 primary care centres have opened and we will deliver 35 additional primary care centres around the country by the end of 2016.

Developing rural tourism initiatives

The very successful gathering initiative was built on local buy-in and with over 5,000 events around the country and visitor numbers increasing by 7% nationally.

Many small towns and villages realised a previously untapped tourism potential while 2,500 people in communities across the country received training.

The government is currently working on a new tourism policy and improving and streamlining the role of councils and their members in tourism is a crucial issue in this review.

Fine gael councillors will build on the success of the gathering by developing the legacy of networks it has created and continuing to invest in tourism infrastructure. This will involve fine gael councillors, through the strategic policy committees, placing a strong emphasis on tourism as part of their economic planning within their areas.

Fine gael councillors will work to promote local tourist attractions and ensure accessibility.

Fine gael councillors will ensure that within each council there is a dedicated fund for tourism development, as well as a separate fund to support local events and festivals that have the ability to bring in overseas visitors.

Sports capital programme

The sports capital programme assists voluntary and community organisations and other bodies to develop high quality, safe, well-designed, sustainable facilities and provides appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation.

The last fianna fáil-led government shut the programme down but minister ring has re-launched the scheme.

Under the 2014 sports capital programme €40 million in grants will be allocated which should see dressing rooms, flood lights and sports halls built and pitches drained.

While not all clubs can be successful, fine gael believes clubs who have not yet been successful in the programme should receive priority.

This €40 million in grants will also create construction and related jobs in communities around the country.

This initiative will be complemented by the important work of the council in the area of sports. Each council has personnel responsible for promoting sport and recreation activities among all ages in the community facilitating and running a range of programmes in their local area. Fine gael councillors will ensure that sports and recreation is prioritised in the council’s work programmes so that this important community service is enhanced and developed further.

The relevance of new council structures in rural areas this year a new system of local government will modernise council structures.

At sub-county level, we will have municipal districts with municipal councils which will be empowered to take certain local decisions affecting the locality.

There will be greater opportunities for local citizens and community representatives to work with their council representatives to prioritise and make decisions on local issues.
",2014,"Local","Fine Gael","Fine Gael_2014_Local"
"Local 2014: Green Party","Introduction

The Green Party strongly believes in the central role of local government and its ability to be a force for good in people’s daily lives. Green Councillors have always acted positively and responsibly to strengthen local democracy and participation, to insist on good planning with community involvement, to protect the local environment, to promote enterprise and sustainable employment, and to hold city and county officials to account. A Green voice on a local council ensures that these issues will not be neglected.

The Green Party believes that strong participative, accountable local government can drive a transformational agenda in sustaining local economies, strengthening environmental protection, tackling climate change, fostering social inclusion and enabling community and voluntary organisations to participate in democratic structures while still maintaining a strong critical voice on behalf of the communities they represent.

The reforms brought about by the current Government under ‘Putting People First’ are nothing more than a window dressing, an attempt at a populist stroke to retire over a third of elected representatives while simultaneously subsuming local community development processes into local governance, thereby silencing their voices in the cause of ‘efficient delivery of services’. Cost savings put out by Government are exaggerated; retiring so many councillors will be costly. There are no proposals to merge County Manger or Director of Services functions across Counties or on a regional basis. In fact, the policy recommendation will be to create a further Director of Services post for Economic Policy Development.

Financing local government has become challenging in recent years. Many Local Authorities are in serious financial crisis, with deficits of millions that are restricting their day to day activities. An over reliance on development charges exposed a deep flaw in how planning was granted to so much inappropriate development while not being financially sustainable as a funding mechanism for local service provision. Now the fund has dried up. While the Local Property Tax (LPT) was promoted by Government as a means of direct financing of Local Government, in reality most revenue generated is going back to Government coffers only to be distributed back to Local Authorities as an Annual Grant.

Notwithstanding these challenges, the Green Party believes that much can be achieved at local level to improve lives every day, and build confidence in the role of local democracy. Green Councillors will work tirelessly, as they have done in the past, to make these improvements a reality.

Reforming the Structures

In Local Government the Green Party will pledge to work towards and advocate for more participative ways of engaging with communities at the earliest possible stage of plans or projects. People should be at the centre of the decision making process.

The Green Party in Local Government will campaign for greater powers to be devolved to local authorities including autonomy in revenue raising and participation of the wider community in the annual budgetary process.

Green Party Councillors will work collaboratively with colleagues from all parties and none towards a common goal of achieving what’s best for the common good.

Regional Government Among the findings of the Mahon Tribunal was a proposal to have a directly elected regional tier of Local Government to replace the current regional authorities made up of selected Councillors from constituent Local Authorities. A directly elected regional authority would strengthen the statutory implementation of Regional Planning Guidelines, the Water Framework Directive, as well as develop regional EU funded projects in energy, transport and nature conservation. 

The Green Party believes that ‘Putting People First’ is limited in its ambition to strengthen democratic accountability and fails to recognise regional government as an important layer in a European context. Green Party Councillors will work with colleagues in neighbouring councils on strategic issues like water, waste and transport to demonstrate the power of a regional approach.

Directly Elected Mayors 

The Government’s decision to give a veto to the councillors the four Dublin local authorities regarding the directly elected Mayor for Dublin is symptomatic of a failure to comprehend the sheer scale of the failure of the current system of annual rotation of the mayoralty between the parties in power. One of Europe’s iconic capital cities has no coherent, consistent system of governance. Four separate local authorities follow different and often contradictory approaches to planning, transport and the delivery of public services. European municipalities cannot understand it.

As Environment Minister, John Gormley advanced proposals for a directly elected Mayor of Dublin with added proposals for a roll out in other large urban centres. The current Government has failed to give any substantial leadership on this issue. The people of Dublin should have been given the right to give their view on the matter through a plebiscite this May.

The Green Party has initiated a petition to direct Minister for the Environment to put the proposal to the people of Dublin, despite the veto by councillors on Fingal County

Council. After the local elections, Green Party councillors on the four local authorities in Dublin will continue to fight for the creation of a directly elected mayor, following a vote of the public.

Changing the Culture

The Green Party will advocate for a radical change in Members allowances, ending the ‘conference culture’ within Local Government in favour of mandatory accredited training for all elected reps in areas of competency and responsibility related to their position.

Holding the executive members to account 

While the provisions of the Local Government Act, 2014 allowing the elected representatives of a local authority vote to suspend or remove a chief executive, are welcomed, the Green Party believes that councillors should have wider powers to hold the executive of local authorities to account for poor performance, misappropriation etc.

Letting communities decide 

Local referendums can be an excellent way to involve people in deciding what happens in their communities. For major projects, such as transport infrastructure and redevelopments, locals should have the option of petitioning for a referendum. The area in question could be Council level or lower, and safeguards would be put in place to ensure adequate participation and transparency.

Local Community Development and Social Inclusion

‘Putting People First’, the document underpinning Government’s approach to Local Government Reform advocates a more ‘streamlined’ delivery of local community development. It is the view of the Green Party that it erodes further the autonomy of community development structures; structures that were undermined by the ‘Cohesion’ process of 2008/9 which brought about the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP). This programme was implemented by Partnership Companies. This process led to much resentment among the sector due to lack of consultation.

Furthermore the abolition of Combat Poverty Agency (CPA), the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism (NCCRI), the Equality Authority and the Community Workers Cooperative (CWC) has removed the critical advocacy, policy making and analysis of government policy in relation to community development. This at a time when that voice was needed most in Irish Society.

Government argues that ‘local government will be the main vehicle of governance and public services at local level-leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and communities effectively and accountably’ (Putting People First).

The process of alignment of structures into a single Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) will have profound effects on how communities relationship with local government. LCDC’s will have power to coordinate, govern, plan and oversee all publically funded interventions at a local level. It may also lead to a tendering process for the delivery of certain plans and programmes across community development sectors.

The Green Party is concerned that this will lead to a politicisation of community development, with limited opportunities for participation and little adherence to the principles of Local Agenda 21; the blueprint for grassroots engagement at community level.

The Green Party will ensure that local authorities facilitate informal, voluntary community assemblies within local areas to provide greater community involvement in neighbourhood development.

Financing Local Government

The Green Party has always supported giving local authorities their own revenue raising powers as a way of increasing their accountability and ensuring that money raised locally is spent locally. The manner in which the Government has implemented the Property Tax has completely undermined this. The Property tax takes no account of ability to pay and fails to promote good usage of land.

The Green Party has always favoured a site value tax on all land excluding agricultural land. This looks at the value of the actual land itself, not including the value of any building (i.e. house) or improvement that has been made to it. Such a tax is not subject to the fluctuations of the property market. It also acts as an incentive to those who own high value sites (such as inner city sites) but who fail to develop them.

The current Property Tax should be replaced with this more efficient site value tax model, along with protections for those on fixed incomes and taking account of large stamp duties paid during the boom years.

The Green Party advocates the piloting of Participatory Budgeting processes in all Local Authorities across the country. This is where communities make the decisions on the allocation of certain amounts of public funds. It has been proven worldwide to be an unparalleled tool in increasing accountability, transparency and social and democratic inclusion in small and very large communities. Durham County Council in the UK has facilitated the participation of over 10,000 people in Participatory Budgeting events. Durham has recently held 13 such events with on average £40,000 of public money been allocated by the public at each event, with an average attendance of 800 per meeting.

The increased powers of Local Authorities over the rate of property tax needs to be counterbalanced with an increased say in decision making on this revenue stream for the public. It is the ideal time to start Participatory Budgeting processes.

Planning & Housing

The Housing Agency predicts that just short of 80,000 new housing units will be needed across the country between this year and 2018. 47% of this will be required in the Dublin region. It is essential that the country does not make the same mistakes in the provision of housing that were made during the Celtic Tiger years. All Green Party councillors will approach the issue of zoning for housing on the basis of:
- Suitability of Density
- Quality of Housing
- Provision of social & transport infrastructure
- Housing mix

The recent housing bubble provides ample justification for taking the provision of housing out of the exclusive control of speculators, by giving local authorities a central role in building to meet the needs of the population generally. Public housing need not be restricted to those on low incomes – a stock of high quality public units made available at market rates can help stabilise the rental market as well as achieving a better social mix.

Social Housing 

Social housing should be placed at the centre of local authority housing service plans to ensure availability of a sufficient number of homes to clear waiting lists. As of December 2013, the Housing Agency estimates that almost 90,000 people are on a social housing waiting list across the country.

Green Party councillors will work with NAMA and the approved housing agencies to tackle this major crisis in social housing. We will support innovative mechanisms to release funding for housing construction. We will oppose any attempts to dilute the social housing obligations under Part V of the Planning Act, 2000.

Private Rented Accommodation 

A large proportion of the housing list is made up of people who are currently in private rented accommodation, but who are defined as being in housing need due to the cost, unsuitability, or uncertainty of their tenure. For this reason guaranteeing tenants’ rights is a logical step towards reducing housing lists,

providing existing private tenants with similar stability to that which is available in local authority housing.

The Green Party will advocate for a stronger enforcement role for Local Authorities in monitoring and addressing anti social behaviour in private rented dwellings by making landlords more accountable for the behaviour of their tenants. This can be achieved in association with a strengthened Private Residents Tenancy Board (PRTB).

Planning Better Communities

Green Party Councillors will insist on more efficient use of public resources and a more transparent planning system. We need to redesign communities to deliver a better quality of life in accommodation, travel, access to essential services and community facilities. New development should be made conditional on targeted funding of community facilities especially schools.

We aim to end the developer led-approach to planning which ignores social, economic, environmental consequences of rising transport dependence and energy consumption. The focus of residential planning should be on the creation of long term sustainable communities with priority on community facilities prior to building houses. Climate change must be incorporated into all local authority planning decisions.

Better Public Space, Green Space and Play Space 

All development plans should include specific details of how public space and green space will be increased and enhanced over the course of the plan’s lifetime. Green Party Councillors will make the provision and enhancement of green spaces a priority. They will also support the designation of important green spaces for protection under the planning system.

Children of all ages have the right to play and recreation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This right is not available to too many of our young people because we are failing to provide suitable public spaces and facilities. We need structured partnerships between local authorities and youth groups and youth workers to make these spaces available.

Public Participation and Information 

While the Irish Government finally transposed the Aarhus Convention into Irish Law in September 2012, there is little to inspire confidence that Aarhus will be taken seriously by Irish public authorities or that Local Authorities will be resourced or trained to meet the demands of the convention. http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/AarhusConvention/AarhusFAQs/ Aarhus has wide ranging implications for Local Authorities and yet many staff officers have never even heard of it.

The three main pillars of Aarhus are; Access to Information on the Environment, Public Participation within decision making processes concerning environmental matters and Access to Justice on environmental issues that is timely and not prohibitively expensive. Every local authority should have a designated legal officer to assist and advise the public in vindicating these rights.

The Green Party is concerned that history will repeat itself as our economy begins to recover. The big two parties are showing signs right across the country that they are ready to engage in the same destructive practices of reckless zoning and pushing through developments that will damage quality of life, harm habitats, and cause environmental degradation. The flaws in the public consultation process that has taken place in the development of new Eirgrid projects and in the establishment of Irish Water show that we do not have the right consultation process in place. We can and must do things differently.

There is extensive research showing that a range of deliberative processes are available to achieve better citizen engagement and community involvement in decision-making. Green Councillors will ensure that these processes are put into practice in all local authorities.

Environment, Food & Energy

Transition to a low carbon green economy and society begins at a local level. Local Authorities are well placed to facilitate this change through planning policy and the operation of their services

The Green Party will work to develop Local Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plans to help Local Authorities and communities to cope with extreme weather events and to offset the worst impacts of those events in the long term.

The Green Party will work collaboratively towards developing Local Energy Descent Action Plans to decarbonise our local economies and communities, move towards local sources of renewable energy, develop sustainable local markets for wood fuel and biomass, promote an enhanced retrofit programme with SEAI, and to reduce energy costs for business and the public sector.

The Green Party will work towards upholding community development principles of advocacy, action and activation within the constraints of the new local government structures in order that CDP’s, FRC’s and all community development groups retain a radical voice and are resourced adequately to participate fully in local decision making.

The Green Party will advocate for increased funding for the arts and library services across Local Authorities including a substantial fund for community arts grants.

The Green Party will work to ensure that all local authorities have Heritage and Conservation Officers and have in place five year heritage and biodiversity plans which will be implemented by a broadly representative heritage forum under the auspice of the newly formed Social and Economic Committee’s (SEC’s). Currently several Counties do not have heritage or conservation officers.

The Green Party advocate for a broad sectoral approach to community mental health led by Social and Economic Committees (SEC’s) which will include all stakeholders and work collaboratively towards creating healthy communities using the Healthy Cities initiative, creative planning, and ensuring that local mental health initiatives are supported. Better spatial planning, including

landscaping, ecological building design, and provision of parks and play spaces can contribute positively towards the mental health of a whole community.

Food

The Green Party will help initiate and support the development of Food Policy Councils across the country. Or food systems are crucial to our local economies, our health and our environment. Food Policy Councils can bring various stakeholders together to develop our food systems in a more planned and sustainable manner that puts health, local communities and environmental protection at its core.

The Green Party will support more organic and local food production and encourage local authorities to support community gardens, allotments, urban vegetable growing (in order to reduce transportation, provide local employment, and strengthen links between producers and consumers). Councils should also facilitate the creation of ‘shared gardens’, where people with unused gardens are willing to temporarily give it away in return for a share of what is grown. This can also bring communities and different generations together.

Energy 

Energy supply must move from carbon to new and clean sources to tackle climate change, to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, to save money, create jobs, lower production costs, enhance energy and food security.

Renewable energy must also be built from the bottom-up, and the benefits must be apparent to everyone. County and City Councils should have the option of establishing their own renewable energy co-operatives, with members of the Council serving on its board. Such co-operatives could establish suitable renewable energy sources and reinvest profits earned within the County, National guidelines would be used to ensure only suitable projects are pursued.

Between 2004 and 2009 Green Councillors led the way in adopting local energy efficiency standards for buildings and these improvements were later taken up at national level. Green Councillors will promote the phased introduction of passive housing standards for all new builds, as the Brussels Region is doing from 2015. Passive housing uses minimal amounts of energy and can have tremendous benefits for owners.

Green Party Councillors will ensure that local authorities lead the way by conducting energy audits and introducing greater energy conservation in public buildings.

Local Economies - Jobs that Last

The new structures of local government provide an opportunity to put greater emphasis on economic development. Not necessarily around County Councils competing with other councils to attract IDA or Enterprise Ireland inward investment but to strengthen local economic activity by supporting SMEs and fostering a culture of local entrepreneurial activity.

Local Authorities too are among the biggest procurers of goods and services in the public sector. By ‘greening’ public procurement policy, goods and services can be purchased locally, favouring local materials for public projects that are less carbon intensive, using local contractors, low carbon cement, FSC certified timber. Life Cycle Analysis should be embedded in all local Authority projects to ensure the most efficient use of resources and the lowest possible overall carbon emissions.

Local Authorities can lead the way in decarbonising economic activity, transitioning communities towards less intensive energy use and powering our workplaces and homes from entirely renewable, locally sourced energy.

Each Council should be responsible for establishing one or more “Repair Cafes”. These would be spaces were unemployed people could learn new skills such as repairing electronics and where members of the public could bring household goods to be repaired. This creates jobs, saves people money and helps reduce waste.

Urban regeneration projects focused on bringing life back into our town centres will provide local employment, re-skill construction workers towards traditional building skills (eg. Kilkenny) and tackle the housing crisis. The ‘Living Cities’ initiative could be expanded and enhanced to support restoration of vernacular built heritage; shop fronts, timber sash windows, stone masonry etc and a national programme of “Living Above The Shop” where premises are restored to a high level of thermal comfort could transform our regional towns in particular.

Local Authorities should lead in promoting ethical purchasing, buying local and buying green and could explore partnership arrangements for local trading systems. This would keep money circulating in a local economy.

County and City Retail strategies should be radically overhauled to ensure that town centres are protected from further edge or out of town development. Levies

should be introduced on free surface car parks on edge of town sites and the funds raised could be used for protecting and enhancing town centres or subventing local public transport services.

Every urban area should have a well developed farmers market. Local Authorities as the licensing authority via Casual Trading Act have a significant role to play in ensuring that markets are well regulated, supply at least 50% local produce, are well located and are branded and supported to develop. It is well documented that market days can give a boost to all local trade.

Transport

The Green Party believes that more control over transport needs to be given to local authorities within the context of a national transport policy.

Cycling

The Green Party has contributed very significantly to the growth of cycling in Ireland. But there is much further to go. Many of our short local car journeys can be substituted by Greener alternatives. Cycling will play a key role in this change. The Green Party will push for the appointment of Cycling Officers in Local Authorities across the country. There are huge economic, health, and tourism benefits to be gained from a proper set of cycling incentives and a proper cycling infrastructure.

Safe Routes to School

The An Taisce Green Flag scheme has helped promote the idea of children walking and cycling to school where possible. The Green Party will seek to have a Safe Routes to School policy written into the development plan of each local authority. We would seek the establishment of a Safe Routes Committee, which would draw parents, teachers, Gardai and the elected representatives together to identify traffic issues surrounding each primary and secondary school in the local authority and seek means to resolve them.

Transport Consultation Committees

The Green Party wants to see local authorities engage in direct and improved consultation with public and private transport provides in their area. We would seek the establishment of Transport Consultation Committees, bringing transport providers together with the elected representatives.

Community Health and Wellbeing

The Green Party advocate for a broad sectoral approach to community mental health led by Social and Economic Committees (SEC’s) which will include all stakeholders and work collaboratively towards creating healthy communities using the Healthy Cities initiative, creative planning, and ensuring that local mental health initiatives are supported. Better spatial planning, including landscaping, ecological building design, and provision of parks and play spaces can contribute positively towards the mental health of a whole community.

The Green Party advocates for the development of a Community Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Strategy in every County. The process of developing such a plan would be led by the LCDC’s in collaboration with relevant agencies, the community and voluntary sector and other relevant groupings. Recognising that collaborative action is needed to strengthen community resilience; particularly among vulnerable groups; young men, ethnic minorities, members of the Travelling Community, etc. Local Authorities can play a key role through better spatial planning, provision of community facilities, addressing issues of rural isolation and enhancing community participation.

The Green Party supports the objectives of the Alzheimer Society in ensuring that Local Government should play a strong role in making urban and rural areas ‘Dementia Friendly Communities’ through the new Public Participation Networks (PPN’s) and in all spatial and community planning. This would ensure that villages, towns and cities can become better places to live for people with dementia and their families.

The Green Party supports in full the Local Election Manifesto of the Disability Federation of Ireland (DFI) and its three grounding principles of enabling participation in local decision making for people with disabilities, improving access to mainstream public services and supports and recognising that Local Government should be guided by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities

The Green Party advocates a broader role for Local Authorities in addressing substance misuse. The Local Drugs Task Force (LTDF) should be brought under the remit of Local Government and be given a more interactive role with other structures; Policing Committees, Planning Policy Committees and Social and

Economic Committees (SEC’s). LTDF’s should be resourced to carry out awareness and community based recovery, employment/training programmes.

By integrating policies such as ‘Smarter Travel’, modal shift towards cycling and walking and planning for better infrastructure, coupled with policies on growing urban food, working with Age Friendly Cities, and Recreation and Sports partnerships, Local Authorities can lead the way towards enhancing the health of communities. Local Authorities should also introduce planning limits on fast food outlets (particularly in the vicinity of schools) and off licences.

Labour Party, 2014

Foreword

Labour in local government has a proud track record of focusing on the issues that puts the local community first and makes it a better place to live for all.

Labour in government is putting the country first by bringing Ireland from a state of economic chaos to stability. This stability has allowed us to focus on creating jobs and dealing with personal debt and the mortgage crisis. In February 2011, there was only enough money to fund the State for five months. By working together we are now seeing the signs of real recovery in Ireland. Unemployment is at its lowest in five years. We have created over 70,000 jobs since the peak of the economic crisis. We have exited the bailout and said goodbye to the Troika.

Across Ireland, Labour councillors are working every day, to build a better life for the people and communities that they represent. They are hardworking people who care passionately about their communities. They believe in protecting the environment, providing young people with opportunities to play and learn, and providing better facilities for families.

Over the next five years, in council chambers around Ireland, the councillors we elect on 23 May, will make decisions which will affect every local community. They will decide what will be built, and where it will be built.

And when we think back on our economic crash, and we think about the property bubble that led to it, that bubble had its origins in the bad planning decisions made in council chambers in the 1980s and 1990s. The frenzy of land rezoning. The permissions to building housing estates on flood plains. The planning corruption scandal that led to an expensive 14 year Tribunal of Inquiry. They can all be traced back to decisions made in the council chamber.

For more than a century, Labour has had an honourable and honest record in local government. Labour has an unrivalled record for good, sensible, sustainable planning, and the Labour Party can be proud that no Labour councillor has ever been found to have taken a corrupt payment.

There has never been a “for sale” sign on this Party, and there never will be.

Labour in local government is playing its part in getting our economy back on track. Our manifesto sets out our clear vision for supporting local jobs and economic regeneration. It also continues Labour’s track-record on the innovative delivery of vital services for local residents.

We believe that the recovery must be felt in our local communities – in our towns, cities and rural areas. No party has a better record in local government than Labour. We are working together to get more local jobs; better transport; better housing; and safer, greener communities.

What do Labour-led Councils look like?

Labour-led Local Authorities have a proven record of achievement, including: stable finances, safer streets and strong schools.

Labour has proved it can run balanced budgets in Local Authorities. Where the Labour Party has controlled Local Authority Councils, we have shown good management and have been prudent with finances.

In Dublin for example, the Labour-led Council has supported SMEs by ensuring lower rates for five years in a row; ensured the increase of the Dublin bikes scheme; and led an unprecedented investment in parks and playgrounds. We have never been involved in any corrupt developer-led planning scandals. We have always put people and local communities first in the planning process.

Working Together Promoting Local Jobs & Businesses

We will work with local Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in the provision of high quality further education and training programmes designed to help people in each Local Authority area to get back into employment.

Labour will ensure the publication of lists of companies who have successfully bid for significant Local Authority funded contracts to enhance the transparency of the procurement process and to allow sub-contractors to see potential opportunities for bidding for business.

Labour will ensure that Council budgets prioritise labour-intensive investment to help create local jobs.

We will roll out the use of a social clause requiring building contractors to recruit a certain percentage of those employed on a public works construction site from the long-term unemployed.

Labour will continue to deliver 63 new, local Intreo Offices offering a single point of contact service from the Department of Social Protection with a practical, tailored approach to employment services and supports for jobseekers and employers alike.

We will convene Local Employment Pacts in each Local Authority area, comprising of Local Employers, Intreo Office Managers, Education Providers (ETBs), Trade Unions and Community Stakeholders who will be tasked with coordinating local implementation plans to reduce local levels of unemployment. These Local Employment Pacts will also be responsible for coordinating local Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans.

Labour is committed to supporting local communities with the new Gateway Scheme, which will continue to be rolled out in 2014. Working in conjunction with Local Authorities, Gateway will provide 3,000 positions to long-term unemployed individuals who will work on regeneration and restoration projects to the benefit of local communities.

The Labour Party is committed to introducing a Youth Guarantee which will meet the needs of young unemployed people under the age of 25. The Guarantee will offer a good-quality place in employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. This will be rolled out from 2014 onwards on a phased basis targeted first and foremost at those most in need of assistance.

Labour will encourage each Local Authority to develop its own tourism strategy highlighting the range of tourist and heritage attractions in their area and also ensure close co-operation with national and local tourism agencies to ensure that Local Authorities promote the most attractive tourism product as possible.

Labour will support the work of Sports Officers in Local Authorities to develop sport and leisure activities (for example local triathlons and Iron Man competitions) locally to ensure healthier lifestyles and also present significant tourism and jobs potential.

We will encourage Local Authorities to work with the social enterprise sector in local urban and rural communities in terms of economic development and job creation as this is a sector which has the capacity to double employment with the creation of an additional 25,000 jobs by 2020.

We will ensure effective Local Authority oversight of any ports which are transferred to Local Authority responsibility given the key role that ports play as centres of local economic activity and in the generation of local employment.

Labour will ensure that Local Authorities as employers promote best practices in terms of equality policies and we will seek to ensure a policy of no 'zero hour' contracts at Local Authority level.

We will work with the new and re-formed Local Enterprise Offices within the Local Authorities to support small and micro businesses and advise on grant support from Microfinance Ireland of funds of up to €25,000 for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.

We will continue to support women in business by working with the Enterprise Ireland Female Entrepreneurship Unit in their strategy supporting ambitious women to grow successful businesses.

Working Together Reviving Our Towns & Cities

Labour will ensure that the new Municipal Districts build on the good work of Town Councils over many years in meeting the needs of the local areas they represent.

We will pilot an empty property scheme to encourage high street property owners to rent out their long-term vacant properties at a set discounted rate for a period of time and encourage the roll-out of ‘Pop-Up’ Shops.

We will review the Derelict Sites Act 1990 in order to strengthen the position of local authorities to compulsorily acquire a property that has been allowed to go derelict and fall into significant disrepair.

We will work with Government to introduce legislation for a levy on vacant sites to get empty sites back into productive use and to boost employment.

We will continue to support the revival of towns and cities through the use of town partnership models involving local businesses, residents, the Local Authority, An Garda Siochana etc. to work together to enhance and maintain town centres and support small local businesses.

We will encourage each council to develop a streetscape plan to ensure that their main commercial and retail streets have a co-ordinated design and planning element and there are clear minimum standards on lighting, bins etc.

We will enhance the safety and attractiveness of the night-time economy in our towns, villages and cities by rolling out the international ‘Purple Flag’ initiative – an accreditation scheme that honours excellence in the management of a town or city area between the hours of 5pm and 5am, working with An Garda Siochana, local businesses and their security staff as well as other night-times workers such as taxi drivers.

We will encourage all Local Authorities to conduct an audit of their car parking and bike spaces to ensure that there is adequate provision for those who may wish to visit the urban centre.

We will pilot the use of a programme –“Caring Retailer” model - where children who become separated from their parents in a town can wait for their parents in a secure environment.

Labour will work with retailers to develop and promote family friendly premises in our towns and cities.

Labour will reflect the role of women in our history by promoting a gender balance in the naming of any new monuments, road and bridges.

We seek to ensure that all future planning recognises the importance of getting a balanced retail mix between international, national and local retailers.

We will work closely with central government to roll-out and extend the Living Cities scheme which will help regenerate our historic towns across the country.

We will investigate the restoration of the‘living over the shop scheme’ to actively encourage people to live in the heart of our towns and cities.

Working Together Rural Development

We will continue to maintain key local road infrastructure, including the upgrading of local and regional roads in 2014.

We will continue to support local development companies in their vital work in supporting rural communities and employment.

We will support the rollout of the ambitious Rural Development Programme between now and 2020.

We will work closely with the Department of Communications on the National Broadband Mapping Plan which will identify rural and less populated areas that need government support in rolling out high speed broadband.

We will fully support the implementation of measures to facilitate the innovative Rural Taxi services.

We will work with the new transport co-ordination units (TUCs) that are being established to enhance the support and delivery of the Rural Transport Programme.

We will promote local agricultural co-operatives and farmers who are involved in small scale commercial production for local and national markets.

We will work with community stakeholders and organisations to encourage the provision of clinics or workshops for young farmers on how to access funding for innovative farm practices at EU level.

We will encourage use of some of the EU funding secured by disadvantaged communities for the development of community projects - such as community centres which would act as a hub for all age groups - in unused publicly owned buildings.

We will work with the local Education Training Boards to encourage the provision of short courses at flexible times for those engaged in farming so as to assist them in the development of other sources of income for themselves and their families that would complement their work.

We will facilitate local communities in setting up a ‘workshop’-type approach for minding men’s mental health, particularly unemployed or retired men or isolated rural dwellers and we will continue to support the very valuable “Men’s Shed” movement.

We will encourage young entrepreneurs to establish businesses with tourism potential in rural areas such as along the Wild Atlantic Way or the Green Way in Mayo.

We will ask school authorities and school teachers to help us develop plans to support sustainable school communities across the entire country.

We will work with the Department of Communications to continue the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.

Working Together Supporting Families in Our Communities

Labour Councillors will work with our local communities to implement the maximum possible reduction in the local property tax for residents from 2015, where funding conditions permit the maintenance of essential local services and a decent society.

Labour is helping families by giving all parents free GP care for their children under 6, as the first phase of our plan for universal primary care.

Labour will continue to assist with the cost of children’s education by committing to the continuation of a school-book rental scheme for every primary school in Ireland, reducing the average yearly costs for families from €80 to €20.

Labour is giving parents a direct say on the costs of their children’s uniforms, and is legislating to create a parents and students charter which will ensure that the voices of parents and students are at the heart of all school policies.

We will prioritize internet safety awareness for children and young people especially for those many children who use library services around the country.

We will continue to support the rollout of the hugely successful Better Energy Homes Schemes to make homes more energy efficient, cut home heating bills and support local construction jobs.

Labour continues to prioritize better planning protection for school playing fields and open spaces, including playgrounds and facilities for children and young people through the development plan process.

Labour will better plan and promote the development of our public parks and green spaces to integrate more healthy walkways, greenways, pocket parks and green gyms.

We will seek to develop underused land as additional playground and recreational facilities.

We will continue to support the roll-out of vital local training and job activation programmes including the Community Employment and Gateway schemes.

We will work with local Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in the provision of high quality further education and training programmes designed to help people in each Local Authority area to get back into employment.

Labour will continue to champion the establishment of Youth Cafes for young people across the country - in 2013, for example, 30 new Youth Cafes received funding approval under a €1.55 million programme.

We will work to tailor the Joint Policing Committees to reflect local needs and requirements across the country by working with the Department of Justice to ensure a more responsive and relevant response to tackle anti-social behaviour and build safer communities.

Working Together Making Services Work Better for Local Communities

Labour will introduce a Charter of Service for users of City and County Council services – including detailed customer service standards for Local Authorities and a Respect Agreement for Local Authority Staff.

Labour will ensure that services are benchmarked for Local Authorities across the country – there must be a minimum service provision level between the Local Authorities and local communities.

Labour will continue to support the roll-out of more Age Friendly Local Authorities. We will ensure age friendly criteria are applied for young and old. New estates for example, must cater for both its older and younger residents.

We will continue the countrywide establishment of Senior Citizen Fora in Local Authority areas to consult older citizens on a range of issues including public transport, active retirement services and personal security.

We will ensure that the Barcelona Declaration is implemented across all Local Authorities. This is an important convention on accessibility for citizens with disabilities that will also ensure on-going consultation with citizens with a disability and their representatives in terms of the provision of Local Authority services.

We will advocate that each local authority has a disability officer and that all staff receive disability awareness training.

We will continue to implement new local government legislation with maximum devolution of power to ensure that each Local Authority offers the most responsive service to citizens.

We will ensure that all local authority policy-making is underpinned by the need for social inclusion.

We will introduce a training programme for new City and County Councillors outlining their duties and responsibilities, including training to combat racism and homophobia and promote equality.

We will promote a consumer protection role for Councils to ensure the public service remit of private sector service providers. Councils should also be able to question, in a public forum, public service providers, like school managers.

We will work with the Courts Service in order to examine the wider use of courthouses around the country, for semi-state agencies, as well as non-profit and cultural organisations, where appropriate.

We will ensure the sustainability of the post office network and as part of that approach we fully support the concept of the post office as a “front office” of Government.

Working Together Enhancing Democracy & Trust

Each Councillor will sign up to an‘oath of office’ on their first day as an elected representative to be an ethical councillor. This follows on from our long record on ethics and accountability in local government.

Labour will continue to build towards full and meaningful public consultation with citizens on Council plans and developments. We will give citizens greater information on how the consultation process works. We will ensure that current consultations are clearly signalled on the front page of the Council’s website.

Labour will promote the greater involvement of local community groups and residents’ associations and facilitate the formal recognition of residents’ associations.

We will support the use of a range of innovative civic participation methods in the local government process including the use of petition rights, town/area meetings and plebiscites where appropriate.

In the context of the EU Charter of Local Self-Government, we will continue to support the drafting of legislation on any proposed referendum on the issue of a directly elected mayor for Dublin.

We will promote a readily accessible hotline for complaints in the form of a free phone number and email address so that residents’ complaints can be quickly and effectively dealt with, developing on the www.fixmystreet.ie model.

We will work with local credit unions and MABs to highlight their work in local communities helping people with problem debt and in taking a stand against unscrupulous money lenders.

Working Together Moving to a 21st Century Public Service Infrastructure

Labour will ensure that each local authority develops a digital strategy detailing how they intend to progress the greater digital delivery of local government services and with clear guidelines on the protection of personal data and use of social media. There should be a clear list of services that each council provides online including, for example, paying parking fines; applying for housing; objecting to a planning application; reporting a pothole; disposing of electrical goods; reserving a library book and finding help in starting a business.

In the interests of democracy and transparency we will continue to promote e-democracy by making sure that all full council meetings are broadcast on the web and archived; and that as much information as possible is published and made available to citizens online.

We will advocate that a clear and user-friendly breakdown of how each Council spends its income each year is published online.

We will drive greater direct engagement with local residents and residents’ associations through digital technology and social media in terms of participation in policy development and priorities.

We will pilot social media surgeries for local residents, businesses and communities to directly engage with the different branches of local government and which will also encourage local communities to get online.

We will particularly target the use of social media and online engagement between the local authority and vulnerable local residents including citizens with a disability or reduced mobility and senior citizens who have traditionally found it more difficult to engage with their local council.

We will encourage neighbouring Local Authorities to co-operate in terms of their procurement processes in order to reduce costs and to ensure similar standards across local authorities.

We will promote the collation and analysis of data across Local Authorities that will help them better plan for future delivery of services and respond to the changing needs of local residents.

We will support an increased availability of “Silver Surfers” programmes which allow older citizens to get internet training and help to get them online especially through our local library network.

Working Together Investing in Housing & Planning

Labour has always recognised social housing building as a vital element in meeting housing need and we will seek a significant extension of the local authority build programme, as a matter of urgency.

Labour has restarted a social housing building programme with an immediate investment of €100m, the first building programme in years and we will significantly build on this to ensure we roll out an extensive house building programme across the country.

Labour Councillors will work with government, the Housing Agency and NAMA, and approved housing bodies to continue identifying suitable NAMA housing units and bring them into social housing use.

Labour Councillors are committed to the eradication of long-term homelessness as a major priority.

Labour is committed to introducing legislation for a levy on vacant sites to get empty sites back into productive use and to boost employment.

Labour will facilitate the use of empty and derelict buildings and sites and we will use the Derelict Sites Act much more vigorously to tackle unsightly and unused properties.

Labour has delivered an additional €15m to tackle boarded-up houses to allow more families to be housed and to prevent these vacant properties attracting anti-social behaviour. Labour Councillors will seek a monthly report from the Local Authority on void status to ensure no local authority house is allowed to stand idle. Labour will also recommend a streamlined approach within Councils to ensure one person is responsible for the speedy resolution of voids.

Labour will require Local Authorities and/or Housing Agencies to promote community involvement in local housing projects and enhance development of housing co-op opportunities.

We will encourage the extension of the “empty nester” downsizing scheme which allows older people who want to move to a smaller home to sell their home to the council and be re-housed in suitable accommodation.

We will work with the statutory agencies to ensure compliance by landlords with registration and standards registration.

We will actively promote better accessibility of people with disabilities to public buildings.

We will also consult the public on possible methods to solve this problem while looking at best practice from other countries.

Labour will support a new water safety campaign in conjunction with Irish Water Safety, Waterways Ireland, local schools and community stakeholders to help address the unacceptable increase in drowning deaths across the country.

Labour will continue to support the work of the Voluntary Rescue Services across the country.

Labour will encourage the development of non-profit walking and jogging clubs.

Labour will support the use of Local Authority civic spaces and public buildings including libraries for the rollout of public health campaigns such as minding your mental health.

Labour will pilot the greater use of libraries for health and well being initiatives such as “Reading Well Books on Prescription” programme which helps people manage their own health and well-being through recommended self-help books.

We will ensure that Local Authorities support victims of racism and challenge racially motivated anti-social behaviour by offering practical support. We will ensure an introduction of a specific policy on anti-racism that is distinct from the authority’s policy on anti-social behaviour.

Working Together Transport, Traffic and Parking

Labour will continue to maintain key local road infrastructure. Already, €332 million has been earmarked for maintenance and upgrade of local and regional roads for 2014.

Labour will champion an approach to transport that prioritizes mobility-for-all including the piloting of a level of service guarantee for transport services for commuters.

Labour will seek to make the National Transport Authority more accountable to Local Authorities.

Labour will encourage each local authority to undertake an ‘active travel’ promotional campaign, such as cycling or walking holidays in Ireland and your local area.

Labour will ensure that neighbourhood redesigns make local communities healthy, walk-able and cycle-able.

We will encourage the use of “walking buses” for children to allow them to walk safely to school each day.

Labour will give Local Authorities a greater role in the design and implementation of public transport services.

We will make bus shelters a centre for public information - prototype outdoor noticeboard given they are easily accessible for public information, while being mindful of heritage towns.

We will continue to rollout park and ride facilities for commuters.

We will progress the creation of linear parks along walking routes/rivers etc. and promote a network of walking routes.

Connecting the Luas – Connecting Dublin

Labour has secured delivery of the important Luas Cross City project which will connect the two Dublin Luas lines and link with the Maynooth/Dunboyne commuter line at Broombridge in Cabra.

2013 was the most successful year ever for Luas with passenger numbers of around 30.3 million. This will grow even further with the Luas cross city project and the extension of services on the Northside. This is part of a wider commitment to connecting people in the wider hinterland to key urban areas.

Labour will work to deliver Metro North, as soon as finances permit.

Working Together Respecting our Shared Environment

We will address the problem of noise pollution including noisy neighbours and anti-social noise in local communities, by making the procedures for dealing with noise issues more accessible and ensuring that complaints are dealt with in a timely manner.

We will prioritise waste prevention, minimisation and recycling within all County waste management plans.

Labour will continue to support Tidy Towns Committees, Local Hero groups and community environmental maintenance groups through the community awards scheme.

Labour will review the existing legislation which deals with our litter laws.

Illegal dumping, litter, dog fouling and graffiti must be tackled appropriately – we will seek to increase the number of Dog and Litter Wardens and prioritize combatting the growing problem of illegal dumping in our cities, towns and villages.

We will broaden the policy of publication of names of persons convicted of offences prosecuted by the Council, particularly environmental offences.

Where suitable land is available we will encourage and support the temporary allotment of such land for cultivation.

We will consider the introduction of a hedgerow scheme – Clare County Council, for example, has introduced a €20,000 scheme where the council is supporting the ongoing maintenance of roadside boundaries by landowners through the provision of grants of €25 per kilometre of hedgerow. This would also act as a stimulus for local contractors.

We will enhance the provision of Bring Centres to encourage recycling and encourage the provision of bottle banks in more communities.

We will encourage the development of green walkways along old railway tracks, rivers, canals and coastal areas.

Labour will ensure that established public rights of way are protected and preserved through development plans and the planning process.

Labour will support Blue Flag status for our beaches.

Labour will encourage measures to shorten the food supply chain such as encouraging farmers’ markets.

We will continue to invest in measures to assess flood risks and protect our communities from flooding.

We will encourage every Local Authority to have a Biodiversity Officer and publish its own local biodiversity plan.

We are committed to the development of a coastal protection strategy and proper coastal zone management.

We are committed to establishing realistic budgets to address flood defences in light of the recent IPCC report.

We will ensure formal coordination of coastal zone management and protection policies between coastal authorities, including those north of the border.

Working Together Learning Communities

We will continue to support the roll-out of vital local training and job activation programmes including the Community Employment and Gateway schemes.

We will work with local Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in the provision of further education programmes designed to up-skill workers in the Local Authority area.

We will continue to support Labour’s Right to Read campaign which addresses literacy and numeracy difficulties in particular through the use of homework clubs, promotion of innovative library programmes such as the “Baby Books Bundle” for young parents and the DCC “Beano Comic Initiative”; increase library outreach services; and enhance “Family Learning through Football” schemes which encourages family learning in an informal setting.

We will promote Local Education Forums involving local representatives, school and parental representatives to discuss and progress the needs of local schools in the area.

We will provide funding to all libraries to allow them to provide free books to all junior infant children during their first week of school, while ensuring that each child becomes a member of their local library.

We will ensure that Local Authority staff have the necessary opportunities for up-skilling and training to allow them to carry out their public service delivery roles though liaising with our local ETBs and Institutes of Technology.

We will encourage the establishment of apprenticeship schemes across a wider range of crafts, including through our Local Authorities.

We will support and fund resources such as www.helpmykidlearn.ie which empower parents to help their children improve their literacy and numeracy skills.

We will continue to ensure that parents get to decide what model of school patronage will be available in new schools in their areas.

We will promote the development of short courses by schools in co-operation with local industry and community groups – making sure that children can learn in non-exploitative ways relevant to their communities.

We will transfer all former FÁS training centres to the control of the local Education and Training Boards/SOLAS, to ensure that local decisions can be made about what education and training opportunities are most relevant.

Working Together Driving Digital Ireland

We will continue to support the roll out of high quality free public Wi-Fi access, where appropriate.

We will prioritize internet safety awareness for children and young people especially for those many children who use library services around the country.

We will deliver high speed broadband free of charge to all second level schools by September 2014.

We will support an increased availability of “Silver Surfers” programmes which allow older citizens to get internet training and help to get them online especially through our local library network.

Working Together Energy & Climate Change

We will continue to support the rollout of the hugely successful Better Energy Homes Schemes to make homes more energy efficient, cut home heating bills and support local construction jobs.

We will ensure that every Local Authority has its own carbon emissions reduction strategy including a comprehensive transport plan that encourages walking, cycling, car-pooling and public transport.

We will encourage each Local Authority to have a detailed energy efficiency plan for how they carry out their business to cut energy costs and reduce their carbon emissions.

We will carry out an energy audit of all Local Authority owned properties to ensure that local authorities take the lead in reducing energy consumption and making their own buildings as energy efficient as possible. Where possible Local Authorities should also pilot innovative renewable energy schemes including solar panels on their own buildings.

We will support the roll-out of urban and rural energy co-operatives where local residents and businesses come together to generate some of their own energy needs.

We will promote measures to allow local communities to undertake voluntary group insulation schemes which can reduce the cost of insulating homes.

We will facilitate the introduction of micro-generation of heat and electricity into Area Development Plans where appropriate to allow new developments to generate some of their own energy needs, where practicable.

Working Together Arts, Heritage & the Creative Industries

We will review our Local Government Arts Policy to fully support the Arts in local communities given the importance of the Arts for engaging the creative mind and its role as an economic driver.

We will facilitate the use of vacant retail premises by exhibiting artists – based on successful schemes such as “Space Invaders” in Galway which uses empty retail units to support local artists.

We will extend the use of exhibition space in community and local civic buildings.

We will involve schools and colleges in the Council’s arts and culture programme.

We will continue to support the Per Cent for Art Scheme.

We will ensure that Local Authorities recognise and fully participate in the Decade of Commemorations.

We will encourage every Local Authority to develop its historical heritage for tourism, for example through the establishment of “historical quarters.”

We will increase the use of plaques on local buildings to highlight buildings of historical importance and the lives of famous inhabitants who have made a significant local or national contribution to public life.

We will continue to support the publication of local and county histories.

We will protect the character and heritage of our historic village centres by the development of Village Design Statements that would ensure all future planning and development takes full cognisance of the historic character of the village centre.

We will champion the designation and protection of key Irish heritage sites as UNESCO World Heritage sites including the Burren; the Céide Fields and North West Mayo Boglands; the Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape; the Historic City of Dublin; early medieval monastic sites – Durrow, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice; the Western Stone Forts – 7 of which are on the Aran Islands, Cahercommaun, The Burren, Caherconree, Staigue, Benagh and the Dingle Peninsula; and the Royal Sites of Ireland – Cashel, Dún Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and, the Navan Fort in Co. Armagh.

Labour will ensure the development and protection of county archive services to preserve local cultural patrimony.

Labour will support local schools, youth groups and libraries in enhancing their music resources and to provide access to musical training and instruments for the benefit of local communities.
",2014,"Local","Labour","Labour_2014_Local"
"Local 2014: PBP","The majority of people have a number of limited expectations of local government. They are concerned about the availability of affordable housing, the maintenance of roads and parks, support for the local economy, youth projects and sporting activities, the provision of playgrounds and libraries and the protection of the environment.

They also want proper planning and development that is transparent. They do not want the irrational, anarchic and developer-­‐driven economic and planning development we saw during the Celtic tiger period and that played such a critical role in crashing this economy.

They want a real say in setting those priorities. They want real influence, not pretend influence or fake consultation, on a weekly and monthly basis.

Yet even modest expectations for sensible local government are repeatedly dashed. In most other European countries people expect more from their local governments. They want these bodies to be responsible for the delivery of such services as education, health, public transport, economic development and waste collection.

Yet despite much rhetoric in the government policy statement, the Irish legislative framework leads to centralisation, lack of democratic participation and growing corporate control.

There are a number of reasons for this.

First, local councils are dominated by unelected managers and the powers of elected councillors have been systemically reduced. Henceforth, these managers will be called CEO and the name itself reflects the growing influence of a corporate culture on local authority decision making.

People Before Profit rejects the myth that this culture leads to a more efficient delivery of services. Quite the opposite often occurs as the example of the Poolbeg incinerator shows. Here an unelected Dublin City manager ploughed ahead with a wasteful project in partnership with the engineering firm, RPS, who gained considerably from this misadventure. More generally, the unelected top managers are increasingly in thrall to consultancy companies such as PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) which specialise in leaching off public spending to boost their profits.

Second, local councils need resources to carry out their tasks. Yet they are being systematically starved of finance. This Government imposed a 9% cut in the local government fund in 2011 and another 9% cut in 2012. There has also being a steady decline in local authority staff with a reduction of over 9,000 posts since 2000. The most recent attempt to cover for this shortfall by taking 3,000 people onto the forced labour scheme, GATEWAY, which pays only €1 an hour for 22 hours work, will not improve matters.

The long term government plan for local authority funding is based on a neoliberal model whereby the customer – not the citizen -­‐ seeks reduction in their property taxes by cutting or privatising public services. This framework, Fine Gael hopes, will lay the basis for the electoral mobilisation of the upper middle sectors of the population from fear that rising taxes will cut into their property values. It is a recipe for a nasty Thatcherite style society.

Third, the culture among the wider political elite promotes a highly centralised system that allows little room for genuine local democracy.

Despite these obstacles People Before Profit councillors will nevertheless press for the following:
1. No Water Charges – Mobilise the community to resist.
2. A new funding model based on allocation from a central fund.
3. Full transparency and democratic oversight of council budgets.
4. Cut out the consultants – stop outsourcing of services.
5. Cut the salaries of the unelected CEOs and subject their decisions to democratic scrutiny. End the junket culture.
6. Full transparency on all commercial dealing between the councils and private firms.
7. Tackle the housing crisis – build more social houses: introduce rent controls.
8. Reverse the privatisation of local services.
9. A differential rates system based on corporate size and profit.
10. For long term strategic planning that re-­‐vitalises town centres and creates social space that encourage community sentiment.
11. Local Authorities should promote and develop the cultural life of their areas.
12. Local authority facilities should be opened to all those in struggle for social justice
13. Turn waste ground and derelict spaces over to community gardens and facilities.
14. Remove the formalities – open up the councils to the digital age.
15. Protect Our Environment – develop natural resources and amenities in the public interest.
16. Oppose all racism and discrimination.
17. A Platform for People Power.


1. No Water Charges – Mobilise the community to resist.
People Before Profit are totally opposed to water charges. It is a double tax and a waste of resources to spend an estimated €1 billion on metering when the money could have been spent on repairing a leaking piping system.

It is also wrong that the resources of local authorities have been transferred to an agency like Irish Water which is being set up for long term privatisation.

People Before Profit councillors will organise local community meetings to resist the charges.

2. A new funding model based on allocation from a central fund.
A share of overall taxation needs to be allocated to local authorities according to the number of residents in each area and with some weighting for social disadvantage.

Ireland needs a proper wealth tax, effective taxation of profits rather than tax loop holes and a progressive income tax system so that there are adequate resources to centrally fund councils.

It does not need another local tax or property tax which is deeply discriminatory against particular areas and individuals who have little income but find themselves living in high banded areas.

Control of this share of overall taxation that is allocated to local authorities should be vested fully in elected representatives.

3. Full transparency and democratic oversight of council budgets.
The most recent Local Government Act 2013 states that council budgets must be published by early October.

People Before Profit will push for open public forums where both the general public and representatives of civil society organisations will be invited to attend and scrutinise the proposed budget.

We want an end to the system where councillors, except for the chosen few from the establishment parties, only see the draft budget a couple of days before it is voted on.

Where budgets are agreed democratically and councils come under threat of dissolution, we shall also seek to mobilise the local citizenry to defend them. The recent bullying threat by Phil Hogan, for example, to disband Donegal County Council should in our view be met with the whole mobilisation of people power.

4. Cut out the consultants – stop outsourcing of services.
The four main global accountancy firms have increasingly developed consultancy wings. These claim to have a particular expertise in ‘helping’ councils make a transition to a more efficient ‘business model’ that is modelled on private enterprise.

We reject such biased claims.

Instead of purchasing advice that produces banal reports based on business speak jargon, we shall rely on the expertise of council staff and the democratic participation of citizens.

5. Cut the salaries of the unelected CEOs and subject their decisions to democratic scrutiny. End the junket culture.
The Dublin City Council manager receives a salary of €175,721 a year. Not only is this morally unacceptable at a time when his own staff have experienced significant pay cuts, it also breeds an elite culture that shows little sympathy for the real suffering of the majority.

People Before Profit councillors will press for reductions in these top salaries. We shall use mechanisms by which elected councillors have scrutiny over appointment of officials to favour those candidates who – after due consideration of their wider policies – donate part of their salaries to local community schemes.

We shall also oppose the junket culture in which councillors get thousands of euros every year to attend conferences, most of which provide no benefit to local authorities or communities.

We are opposed to a system whereby councillors who are chairpersons of Strategic Policy Committees can earn an extra €6,000 a year and will demand that these allowances be scrapped.

We are entirely opposed to profiteers who set up conferences for councillors as a device for milking the public purse. We shall scrutinise and reveal any such activity.

At present an informal arrangement exists whereby elected councillors are effectively cajoled into backing managers’ plans by getting more favourable treatment on clientalist work. We shall expose any discriminatory treatment of councillors – whatever their views -­by managers.

We shall also seek to gain a democratic majority for using the powers under the Local Government Act to make managers more accountable. In particular we shall make full use of the provisions whereby the chief executive will also have an obligation to report on the implementation of policy determined by the elected council.

Where the elected council is not satisfied with the report of the chief executive or the actions contained therein, they may adopt, by resolution, a statement outlining their reasons for this view. The chief executive has 14 days in which to provide a comprehensive response indicating what new actions will be undertaken or why no alternative course is available. On foot of this report, or otherwise, the elected members can request the chief executive to advise on the review of policy, or the implementation of policy

6. Full transparency on all commercial dealing between the councils and private firms.
Under the guise of commercial secrecy, the dealings between council officials and private firms have become less transparent. In particular, the growing use of Public Private Partnerships have led to the over use of ‘commercial secrecy’ rules.

We shall demand that any firms wishing to conclude commercial agreements with local authorities shall both respect union rights and be willing to be totally transparent on these agreements.

7. Tackle the housing crisis – build more social houses: introduce rent controls.
The biggest single task of any local authority is to be an effective provider of housing for those in need. People Before Profit councillors will challenge the current model of not building council houses which has led to a housing crisis. This model sees Local Authorities relying on the RAS (Rental Accommodation Scheme) and long term leasing arrangements to house those in need of accommodation. This is effectively a subsidy to landlords. While this did manage to provide much needed housing at the beginning of the crash, it is now part of the housing crisis as landlords pull out of these schemes because they can make more money by renting privately and refusing to be tied into Joan Burton’s unworkable rent caps.

We shall
A) Demand that the local councils invest in social housing and commence and an emergency house building programme.
B) Press for a change of law so that councils are given powers to control rents. In the meantime, we shall use every possible bye-­‐law to regulate the housing market.
C) In the interim, demand an increase in the rent caps for social welfare recipients based on surveys of local rented accommodation.
D) Oppose the policy of leaving council apartments and houses vacant under the pretext that the internal furnishing be removed because of insurance. We shall promote a policy of immediate use of council property based on indemnity against insurance claims.
E) The recruitment of more maintenance staff to repair social housing and the creation of direct labour units..
F) The use of some 30,000 unoccupied dwellings that are in local areas to house those on the waiting list.

8. Reverse the privatisation of local services.
The privatisation of waste collection has been a disaster. There has been a growth in illegal dumping, due mainly to rising levels of poverty, which poses a health hazard. Charges for waste collection are rising and in some case collection bags are getting smaller.

Waste collection must be brought back into public ownership and the charges phased out. Councils must also establish proper, publicly run re-­‐cycling services.

Clamping is a further example of the absurdity of privatising services. The recent attempt of Dublin Parking Services to set a target of 21 clamps a day for each of their patrol staff shows how a profit driven system is based on stress rather than sane traffic management. This company need to be brought under public ownership and a sane parking policy implemented.

9. A differential rates system based on corporate size and profit.
The heart of many cities and suburban centres is being destroyed both by the presence of large retailers on outskirts and by the effects of austerity.

People Before Profit councillors have proposed a progressive rates system which would see small struggling businesses getting a reduction in their rates while large profitable corporations would pay more.

We also propose an end to the upward only rents policy.

10. For long term strategic planning that re-­‐vitalises town centres and creates social space that encourage community sentiment.
Larger retail chains favour development on the outskirts of towns which rely on greater use of cars.

We shall seek to reverse this policy by scrutinising such planning applications.

In particular towns, we shall also favour one or two hour free parking in order to discourage the flight of shoppers to the outskirts where parking is free.

Where there is any application for any large corporate development, we shall demand that developers fund proper notices to inform the surrounding public and enable people to attend public forums to question them and vote on possible outcomes.

11. Local Authorities should promote and develop the cultural life of their areas.
Urban space is not just for selling and buying. As neoliberal capitalism gnaws away at communities and tries to turn everything into a commodity, local authorities have a vital role to play in promoting a cultural life in their area.

They should help fund theatres, galleries, concert halls and other cultural centres and provide public spaces for social interaction beyond pubs and alcohol.

12. Local authority facilities should be opened to all those in struggle for social justice.
People Before Profit supports the campaign for a living wage. We also support resistance to cuts in public services and community centres.

Where there are legitimate struggles for social justice, People Before Profit will favour the opening up of council facilities to assist people to organise. Instead of denying activist groups access to libraries, spaces or halls under the pretext of ‘public liability insurance’, councils should assist the creation of spaces to enable people to organise.

13. Turn waste ground and derelict spaces over to community gardens and facilities.
During the Celtic Tiger almost all public space was taken over for commercial purposes. After the crash, there are many vacant or derelict buildings. There is also much ‘waste space; as development ceases.

People Before Profit will press for the formation of community gardens on all suitable spaces. These give new opportunities to both grow our own food and build up a community spirit.

We see no reason why major buildings in towns are left empty and shall demand that, even on a temporary basis, they be turned over for community facilities

14. Remove the formalities – open up the councils to the digital age.
The procedures by which meetings are conducted are foreign to many. The use of a highly formal language and procedure creates obstacles to the involvement of the citizenry. Much of the real business that is submitted by democratically elected councillors is never reached at council meetings while the business submitted by the manager and the chairperson is always reached. We need to turn meetings around so that councillors business is dealt with first.

Meetings of the local council should be broadcast and accessible to the wider public. The votes of councillors on individual issues should be clearly recorded and made available to the public.

There should be a transparent tracking system for people to input complaints, suggestions or grievances.

15. Protect Our Environment – develop natural resources and amenities in the public interest
Encouraged by successive governments over recent years, local authorities have ignored the views of the public and favoured the interests of private developers when it comes to the development of local amenities and natural resources. They have supported the private profit-­‐driven exploitation of resources and public assets. The public are always the last to know when it comes to development plans in their own local area. This must stop. The protection of our local environment and the needs of local communities must come first.

We will demand:

Real public participation and proper environmental protection in the planning and development of local areas.

The establishment of open, public, community and environmental forums to guide local planning and development.

Environmental, economic and social cost-­‐benefit analysis of all development proposals

The provision of adequate public open space – including, community and youth facilities, public forests, urban meadows and walking areas in all development plans and proposals.

16. Oppose all racism and discriminatio
There is a growing tide of xenophobia and racism across Europe as right-­‐wing parties tries to scapegoat migrants for an economic crisis cause by the financial elite. Migrants to Ireland also report a rise in racism. Minorities like the Traveller community are discriminated against. Refugees and asylum seekers suffer under the system of ‘direct provision’.

People Before Profit councillors pledge to champion the rights of minorities and to stand up to racism and discrimination, including institutional racism.

17. A Platform for People Power.
Given the constraint on local councils by the centralised state structures, People Before Profit fully recognise that it will be difficult to use councils to pursue our wider political agenda.

We pledge however to act always as community representatives that seek to mobilise people power to pursue issues that affect our communities.

We shall call open meetings and assemblies where appropriate and use all our political skills to advance the struggle to create a better society.

This election offers citizens across this state the opportunity to join with voters in the North and vote for real change at local government level.

Sinn Féin will have almost 350 candidates standing across the island of Ireland in every one of the 32 counties.

Citizens here have become justifiably disillusioned with a political system that has failed them and which is far removed from their everyday lives and incapable of resolving current difficulties or delivering for ordinary citizens.

The Fine Gael/Labour government have broken their commitment to a new way of doing things and reforming our political system. They have used so-called “local government reform” as a smoke screen to further undermine local democracy and centralise power within government.

There is an urgent need for fundamental political reform of both our political culture and the entire political system. Sinn Féin has robustly opposed the cynical and minimalist approach to reform by Fine Gael and Labour, and in the past by Fianna Fáil, and we will continue to do so.

Sinn Féin is firmly committed to providing strong representation and the highest quality of leadership at both local government level and within communities in order to achieve the best delivery of services which meet local need.

We consider local government to be one of the most important pillars of our democracy. We also believe that local government must be fit for purpose in the 21st century. Citizens must come first, not the political elites.

Our approach to local government reform and delivery is based on the following key principles;

1. Democracy. Democracy is about more than elections. The public have a right to hold local authorities and the services they deliver to account.
2. Devolution. Maximum devolution of power from central government to local government.
3. Community. People have a right to live in their community, safe and secure in their home.
4. Economic Renewal. Key to economic recovery will be regenerating the local economy.
5. Waste Management. Towards a zero waste strategy.
6. Environment. Development and planning must be transparent, ethical and sustainable and not a threat to our environment.
7. Accountability. Local authorities must be held to account for their actions by the public.

Sinn Féin is a republican party. We want an end to partition and the development of a citizen centred rights based society. Empowered local communities should be the cornerstone of this. Our core political values are based on equality and fairness for everyone. Our commitment is to serve in the best interests of citizens first and deliver for the local community through strong representation and leadership on Councils.

On May 23rd I am asking you to vote for Sinn Féin. Let us make change together.

Le meas,

Sinn Fein Achievements since 2009

- Case Study, South Dublin County Council

Following the local election in 2009 Sinn Féin councillors in South Dublin County Council agreed to enter a pact to run the Council for the next five years. In setting out the agenda for change on South Dublin County Council (SDCC), councillors agreed to pledge their annual €4,700 conference and education expenses towards the delivery of South Dublin County Council’s first Homeless accommodation. This fund amounted to over €300k over the five budgets of the Council. In the summer of 2013 the Council Mayor, Sinn Féin Cllr. Cathal King officially opened the 16 bed transitional Homeless facility.

Sinn Féin has delivered for the people of South and West Dublin since 2009.

» Despite the Fine Gael/Labour Government cuts to the funding for windows and doors in council homes, €1M was allocated in each council budget for this purpose resulting in a better quality of life for hundreds of our council tenants.
» Following the delivery of the homeless accommodation in 2013, conference money this year went towards the Housing adaption grants that the Government slashed by more than 50%. €64K will go towards improving the lives of elderly citizens.
» Since 2009 Sinn Féin have secured a reduction in commercial rates of over 5% in an effort to ease pressure on local businesses and protect local employment. In addition to this, in the Councils 2014 Budget a scheme was introduced to support small businesses who pay less than €10k annually by means of cash back if rates are paid by July 2014. This will protect those very small businesses that generally employ local people.

Sinn Féin have ensured that the rents of council tenants have not increased one cent over the five year period despite efforts by others to do so. SDCC has the lowest rent scheme of any Local Authority in the State at 10% of income.

Sinn Féin ensured that the 2014 Council budget absorbed the cost of the property tax on council homes. SDCC has more than 10,000 social housing units and not one tenant has had to pay any portion of the Local Property Tax as set by the Fine Gael/ Labour Government.

As Mayor, Cllr. Cathal King has proposed a competition through the Library and Arts office for a sculpture of a piece of street art to be developed to commemorate the women and men of 1916 to be unveiled Easter week 2016 in Tallaght Village.

SDCC has become the second Local Authority in the State to pledge full support for full marriage equality for the LGBT community and their children.

Following a surge in youth suicides in the locality SDCC working in partnership with Comhairle na nÓg and the South Dublin County Youth Council launched a mental health smart phone app that maps all of the various mental health services in the SDCC area. The app is called MindMindR and can be downloaded from the App Store and Android for free.

A new local playground scheme is being introduced this year with a €500k budget that will increase in the coming years.

Sinn Féin has secured an increase in the Housing, Roads and Community, and Recreation budgets this year.

1. Real Delivery for Local Communities

Local Government Funding

The lack of appropriate levels of local government funding is one of the main barriers to building stronger relationships between local government, local representatives and the communities whom they serve.

Local government should have greater economic autonomy with the ability to leverage loans from central government and other sources against future revenue raising.

Sinn Féin believes local government should play a greater role in Ireland’s recovery through improved efficiencies in spending, but this cannot be achieved through the sacrifice of frontline services. In addition, to aiding recovery, we need local government focusing on social and economic development.

Sinn Féin’s goal in funding local government is: » To ease the burden of austerity measures on the population, especially the most vulnerable.

The Local Government Fund

The Local Government fund was set up in 1999 to provide additional funding to local authorities for general discretionary funding and initiatives. It was financed by way of the full proceeds of motor tax and an Exchequer contribution. In 2013 the Government made the decision to take €150m out of the Motor Tax Fund for the central deficit, attacking the very heart of local government finance. Sinn Féin in Government would restore the full proceeds of motor tax to the Local Government fund.

In 2012 the Fine Gael/Labour Government introduced the household charge followed by the Local Property Tax (LPT) in 2013. They claimed the revenue raised by this would be used to fund Local Government. In 2013, local authorities did not see one cent of the LPT.
» To invest resources to revive and grow the economy, create jobs and improve the wellbeing of our communities.
» To ensure greater fairness in the sourcing and use of scarce resources.

More often than not individual cash strapped local authorities are forced into increasing commercial rates and charges simply to pay their day-to-day running costs. This has put a considerable burden on communities and small businesses who then carry the burden. A report by the Irish Small & Medium Enterprises Association (ISME) in 2011 stated that commercial rates threatened the survival of 40% of small businesses.

Our five key Local Government funding commitments include:

1. Abolishing the local property tax.
2. Maintaining central government funding of local government. We will halt the cuts from central government funding because taxpayers should not have to pay twice for local government – once through central taxation and again through local taxes.
3. Introducing/ring-fencing a number of small secure and environmental friendly funding sources at local level.
4. Developing a fairer, revenue neutral, system of commercial rates that benefits small and medium enterprises.
5. Developing a general government loans fund for future local government developments.

Best Use of Public Spending – Social Procurement » Local authorities should aim to help support local businesses by ‘best contract practice’, including providing long-term contracts where feasible and no late payments.

Local Authorities should strengthen the ability of small and medium businesses to bid for local authority contracts. Local authorities together could develop a shared national online portal for easy-to-use submissions for contract work. In addition, each authority could undertake to host an annual event to showcase the best of local businesses for promotional purposes. They could take the opportunity to hear the views of local businesses and learn how they could support them through regular meetings or annual business summits.

There are a number of EU schemes to support reduced household energy usage in Ireland. Unfortunately, these tend to be under-utilised for a number of reasons, including lack of publicity and the fact that the householder has to bear 70% of the cost of insulation/energy efficiency. Local authorities could centralise the publicity and promotion of these savings through their public offices and material.

In addition, following the liberalisation of the energy market in the EU it may be possible to establish energy co-ops with the local authorities at their centre, as already occurs elsewhere in Europe . If not now, it will certainly be an option in the near future. The local authority would be a bulk purchaser of energy supply from the wholesale market at much reduced cost and would invite willing households and businesses to join the co-op and avail of reduced energy costs.

Sinn Féin is calling for the introduction of a revenue neutral, progressive commercial rates system based on the profits of a business.

Property Tax

Sinn Féin is committed to the abolition of the Local Property Tax. The property tax is a totally unjust tax which should be removed. This would save 1.8 million homeowners an average of €278 per year. This is the type of assistance that struggling families need and the type of initiative which will keep jobs in local communities.

Commercial Rates

Commercial Rates are an important source of finance for local government. The current valuation system however is unfair and inequitable. Rates are paid whether the business is profitable or not, threatening in many cases the survival of small businesses. They are often the third highest cost after wages, and they particularly affect the devastated retail sector. Even the smallest businesses can pay as much as €5,500 per annum in rates (example taken from a small florist, Ballymun, Dublin). According to a report conducted by ISME in 2011 commercial rates have increased by a massive 47% over the last ten years. This is as a result of successive governments’ failure to adequately fund local government. Commercial rates have become a stopgap for funding day-to-day running costs of local authorities.

As can be seen from the illustration below Commercial rates as a percentage of total local government funding has increased since the economic crisis began.

The Council would decide what total yield from commercial rates they need to receive. Rate bands will be established and each business will fall into band one or another depending on their profits. Given the complexities involved in the Revenue Commissioners sharing this information with local authorities, the onus will be on the businesses to apply for the reduction in the rate providing they provide evidence through their annual revenue return and profits.

Businesses will be invited annually to make their application to the council based on proven profit levels, and designated to the varying profit bands accordingly. A statistical calculation is applied to ensure the councils requiring funding from commercial rates is met by analysing the number of businesses in each profit band and the level of rate they must pay for that year.

The result will be to shift some of the burden from smaller and medium enterprises to those that can afford to pay more.

2. Growing the Local Economy

Economic Development

Councils are well placed to develop skills and employment hubs. Councils should take the lead in networking of local business, the semi-state sector, schools, colleges and training services to ensure that those seeking employment have the skills to match employment and skills needs in local authority areas. Clusters can generate key economic benefits in terms of innovation, energy and productivity. Local authorities should develop economic, educational and cultural clusters to generate employment and attract investment.

Sinn Féin councillors will work to introduce measures to stimulate the local economy such as the setting aside of a component of rates against an investment to enhance premises and in particular shop frontage. We will ensure that rates are not passed onto start-up businesses that have been accumulated during periods of a premises being vacant. Sinn Féin will also give small business a break by legislating to end the practise of ‘upwardly only rent reviews’.

Communications Infrastructure

Currently Ireland has one of the lowest levels of high-speed broadband access in the European Union. This is totally unacceptable if we are to build a sustainable economic recovery. There are areas of rural Ireland that still do not have access to broadband.

High-speed access to broadband must be made a priority for our local businesses, communities and schools.

Major investment is needed in terms of broadband and infrastructure. This State not only lags far behind the EU average in broadband rollout, it also has some of the highest costs and lowest speeds in the EU.

Sinn Féin believes that every home in the country should have access to broadband speeds of at least 30Mbps.

3. Protecting Communities through Sustainable Development

Transparent and Ethical Planning

Planning affects many aspects of our lives. It effects where and how we live. It effects where we work, socialise and how we travel. There is a need for strong local input into the planning of roads, transport, infrastructure, homes and recreational amenities.

The Mahon Tribunal issued damning findings on corrupt payments for land rezoning and planning permissions in Dublin. Findings of corruption were made against councillors from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. A former Chair of Dublin County Council and an Assistant Dublin City and County Manager served time in prison. Judge Mahon concluded that planning corruption had become entrenched because no one was prepared to stop it.

Sinn Fein elected representatives will do whatever it takes to root out malpractice and corruption in planning once and for all – whether among elected representatives or council officials.

The inclusion of communities in the process of planning is critical to ensure successful outcomes. There should be independent checks at various stages of the City & County Development Plans process to ensure Community Involvement up to that point. Failure to achieve this independent accreditation should see the reversal of that stage of the plan’s development with that part of the process having to be undertaken again in order to achieve proper community involvement objectives.

Years of planning scandals and corruption have allowed the planning process to be brought into disrepute. However rather than reform the planning process and make it more accountable, consecutive governments have simply stripped powers away from elected councillors. As a result of legislation such as the Strategic Infrastructure Bill and Regional Waste management plans more and more decisions are being made by unaccountable bureaucrats in local authority management, an Bord Pleanála and in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. The planning process is structured so as to alienate local commutes and benefit the developer and speculator. Poor planning has been a contributory factor

in the current economic crisis and to many of the social problems experience in deprived areas of urban Ireland. This includes unfinished estates, estates without essential services and in some cases houses or apartments so shoddily constructed that they were in fact a danger to their occupants.

The planning process must be accountable, democratic, open and transparent. Sinn Féin aims to create a more meaningful role for communities in planning and decision making processes.

Pylons and Wind Turbines

Sinn Féin believes the Government needs to take seriously the concerns of citizens who are opposed to the construction by EirGrid of high voltage overhead power lines and associated pylons. There are genuine concerns held by residents who are expected to live along the routes of these power-lines about the possible impact on land values, agriculture, tourism and the potential consequences on human health.1 

Housing

At present there are 89,872 households on waiting lists for local authority housing in this state.

These people are living in cramped unsuitable conditions and in the current system will be waiting a very long time to be housed appropriately.

Local authorities have increasingly moved away from the provision of public housing in recent years in favour of what is known as housing support. This model puts the onus for housing provision on the voluntary and community sector as well as through subsidising private landlords. While the voluntary and community housing bodies provide great service and are an essential part of our Housing system they are not capable of providing the level of housing needed.

There are 78,000 people receiving Rent Supplement and 23,000 in the Rental Accommodation Scheme. These cost the state nearly half a billion euro a year but bring us no closer to a long-term sustainable provision of housing.

1 A 2005 study conducted by Oxford Professor Draper found that living within 200 metres of high-voltage power-lines increases a child’s chance of getting cancer by 69%. Draper G, Vincent T, Knoll ME, Swanson J (2005) Childhood cancer in relation to distance from high voltage power lines in England and Wales: a case-control study. BMJ 330: 1290-1293.

In more recent times it has become almost impossible in some parts of the country to acquire private rented accommodation within the maximum rent supplements. The maximum rent limits applicable to the Rent Supplement Scheme should be reviewed and adjusted to reflect real rental prices and to ensure that the payment can act as an effective barrier to homelessness.

Before the onset of the economic crisis the State was building 4,000-5,000 social housing units a year. However in 2013 the State built just 546 homes at a time when housing need is much more severe. Over 1 billion euro has been cut from the housing budget since 2008 but the number of those in need of social housing has more than doubled. Numbers experiencing homelessness or who are at threat of homelessness have risen starkly since the economic downturn.

The government’s only proposal has been to pass responsibility for social housing onto the private market and give greater workload to the overburdened voluntary sector. They have hailed social leasing from NAMA as a great solution but it will cost the state considerably and has only delivered 512 homes in three years.

Public Private Partnerships

Private Public Partnerships have proven to be a financial and social disaster. PPPs must never be solely relied upon as a means to provide homes or regeneration for local authorities. They have left communities in Dublin and Limerick decimated through the collapse of redevelopment plans. Sinn Féin believes the redevelopment plans in Limerick and Dublin need to be prioritised and completed.

Waste Management Services

Sinn Féin councillors will work to ensure that residents live, work and play in communities that are clean, safe and sustainable. Sinn Féin believes that essential services, such as domestic waste collection should remain under local government control. Pending this service being taken back into public ownership we propose that the local authorities should have maximum control over those currently providing the service.

Sinn Féin believes that local authorities should be the regulators for domestic waste collection in their areas. This would allow them to ensure that any commercial waste company that is successful in tendering for a waste collection contract would:

1. Be answerable to the local authority.
2. Provide a service that is affordable, accountable and accessible.
3. Provide a waiver scheme.
4. Provide follow up services such as cleansing and clearing up spillages.
5. Have their commercial contracts reviewed on an annual basis.

Sinn Féin councillors believe that local authorities should review contracts with companies collecting recyclables to negotiate new contracts whereby companies pay councils to collect this waste, as is the case in the six counties.

Sinn Fein believes that councillors should have a more hands on role in the development and implementation of Waste Management Plans. The current situation whereby City and County Managers have the power to impose incinerators and landfill dumps is simply unacceptable and undemocratic. The adoption of a waste management plan should become the reserve function of councillors.

Estate Management

Estate management and maintenance is a traditional area of local authority competency which has been neglected. The appearance of communities adds to people’s quality of life, so this is an area we would like to see more resources directed to.

Environmental Protection and Waste Management Local authorities will draft and implement climate change action plans. The plans will be based on a Climate Change Bill. They will set specific local targets, based on national and international targets, for the reduction of emissions in relation to energy use, transport, housing and waste management. These targets will be developed following a consultation process with relevant experts and stakeholders.

Incineration

Sinn Féin opposes incineration and believes that current plans for incinerators should be abandoned. Sinn Féin councillors will advocate a Zero Waste Strategy for managing our waste crisis. This strategy aims to reduce waste to zero based on the principles of reduce, reuse and recycle.

Towards Zero Waste means designing and managing products and production processes to systematically avoid and eliminate the volume and toxicity of waste and materials, conserve and recover all resources, and not burn or bury them.

Water Charges

Water is a right. It is a resource that everyone needs to live and as such we believe it is a basic right.

Sinn Féin is opposed to the Government’s plan to install domestic water meters and to introduce water charges. We believe water services need to be kept under the democratic control of local authorities.

Sinn Fein is opposed to the introduction of water charges, which we believe is just another tax being heaped upon already struggling households. Fresh, free running water is a basic right for our people, and just as we have prevented the introduction of water charges in the North, Sinn Féin are opposed to the introduction of water charges in this jurisdiction also.

The establishment of Irish Water - Uisce Eireann will do nothing to improve the distribution or quality of water.

We have already seen the spiralling costs of Irish Water, with €50 million spent on consultant costs, staffing costs are expected to account for up to €2 billion over a seven year period while 29 of the senior employees of Irish Water are on salaries of €100,000 and above.

Sinn Féin opposed the establishment of Irish Water. We believe the money currently being spent on installing water meters should be re-directed into improving the Victorian era water infrastructure, which is losing up to 40% of water as a result of leaks.

Sinn Féin believes this money could be better used to install district meters, upgrade the mains system and stop the leaks.

District metering would allow for local authorities to monitor water usage and leakage at neighbourhood level. We are opposed to household charging and therefore metering as a means to measure usage on this basis.

Water conservation must be incentive driven.

A number of simple planning regulations can greatly reduce the amount of water consumption. These include promotion of water harvesting with the introduction of water butts, use of grey water and making dual flush systems mandatory.

4. Providing Responsive Public Services

Transportation

Sinn Féin believes transport policy needs to focus on delivering the most efficient movement of people and goods. This means increasing the availability and use of public transport through planning and design policies, especially at local level, which make public transport economically viable and desirable.

Large portions of a formerly comprehensive rail network were closed down. Many local and secondary road networks are crumbling and the countryside in particular is beset by accident black spots that regularly claim lives. Most cities and towns also lack adequate provision for pedestrians making it dangerous to even cross a road, particularly for the elderly, people with disabilities and those with prams or small children.

Resources and consideration at local authority level can contribute to improving our transport needs.

Fire and Ambulance

Sinn Féin want to see local authorities continuing to deliver publicly owned, world-class fire services including emergency, rescue, prevention and enforcement with national standards and coordination free at the point of delivery.

However we do want to see reform of the fire service. Sinn Féin proposes to limit Assistant Fire Chiefs to 2 per local authority. To ensure co-ordination takes place Sinn Féin advocate the establishment of a single Strategic Fire Services body to coordinate and regulate the fire service state-wide and later island-wide, in line with international best practice. This body would standardise training and service delivery on an all-Ireland basis with councils still providing the service. The authority would continue to be answerable directly to councils through the Fire Chiefs and the SPCs.

Sinn Féin will ensure that the fire brigade service and its 3,300 staff are fully supported in the 216 fire stations so that we can have a service to meet modern demands. We believe that there is an urgent need for a state-wide co-ordinating body for the 37 local fire authorities in the 26 Counties. At present there are differences in training, equipment, policy and methodology across local fire services. The lack of a co-ordinating body also explains the lack of emphasis put by successive government on the fire services in contrast to that of the other emergency services.

Recreational Services and Amenities

Local authorities have worked successfully with Local Sports Partnerships to promote participation in sport at all levels through the promotion of mass participation events such as cyclo-sportives and fun runs.

In recent years there have been cuts to the funding provided for local amenities such as parks, swimming pools and libraries, Sinn Féin councillors have been to the fore in working with local communities to oppose these cuts.

Sinn Féin will advocate the full exercise of all local powers and use our collective strength to lobby for additional resources to ensure that each community has equal access to basic public arts, sports, cultural and recreational services and amenities as a right.

5. Improving Quality of Life for Communities

Community Safety

People have the right to feel safe in their homes and communities. Local authorities and communities themselves have a hugely important role to play in cooperation with the Gardaí in preventing criminal, antisocial and nuisance behaviour.

Local councillors are represented on Joint Policing Committees (JPCs), which provide a mechanism to provide for increased Garda accountability at a local level.

Sinn Féin wants additional powers for Joint Policing Committees to give local representatives direct input in the development of Local Policing Plans. Joint Policing Committees also need to be given a more effective role in ensuring that Local Policing Plans are fully implemented.

Sinn Féin are also committed to the development of approaches which have as a long term goal the reduction of crime such as Community Restorative Justice (CRJ), Community Mediation and Community Courts.

Community Restorative Justice (CRJ) involves victims and communities directly and ensures that the offender actually confronts their behaviour and its causes and takes steps to make up for the harm they have done. This ‘restorative’ dimension often leads to much higher levels of victim satisfaction with the process.

Community Mediation Schemes (CMS) can be employed to respond to non-criminal nuisance type behaviour and neighbour disputes and can help avoid the delays and high costs that a court based process involves. Community Courts have been pioneered in other countries such as the USA, most notably in New York City.

Community Courts involve a community centred approach which deals with relatively minor offences, such as public order offences, in a swift manner which attempts to understand the background to the offence and the offender and putting in place mechanism to avoid reoffending such as education, treatment programmes and community engagement. In 2007, the National Crime Commission recommended their introduction, starting with a Dublin pilot however this recommendation was never acted upon. The issue has recently been considered positively by the Oireachtas Justice committee.

Childcare

Sinn Féin have long advocated for state-led provision of regulated comprehensive childcare to be made available to all, equally and as of right and funded by general, direct and progressive taxation. This would include universal early childhood education and care, universal preschool for children aged from three to five years old and an afterschool childcare system.

Unfortunately this has yet to become the reality for families in Ireland. The lack of quality, affordable childcare prevents many women who wish to do so from working outside the home. Irish childcare is in crisis. It is notoriously expensive and simply out of reach for many low-income families. Many low-income parents now face fees that have increased or even doubled. Indeed a recent report commissioned by the Donegal Childcare Committee indicated that a two child family faces an annual bill of €16,500 for full-time child care, with the average full-time cost over a ten month period estimated at €9,150 for one child and €16,470 for two children. This places Ireland at the second highest point in the scale in terms of costs across all OECD member countries.

In September of last year, Sinn Féin launched Bright Start, which is the Northern Assembly’s programme for affordable and integrated childcare. The programme aims to address the need for a programme of affordable and integrated childcare.

While local government does not have direct powers or control over childcare provision at present, councillors can ensure that developers provide childcare facilities as part of their planning permission. All local communities and economies have a vested interest in making sure that childcare is available to all who need it. Sinn Féin councillors will stand with parents and providers in making this demand and will use their influence to ensure that local childcare needs are fully met.

Mental Health

Sinn Féin believes that improving mental health services is an essential part of social and political reform in Ireland. Mental health difficulties affect communities right across Ireland and these elections represent an important opportunity to highlight what can and should be done at local level to improve people’s mental health and wellbeing.

Sinn Féin supports the Mental Health Reform groups “Four Key Local Actions”. Local elected representatives can promote good mental health and ensure the social inclusion of those with mental health difficulties.

One in seven adults in Ireland will have experienced a mental health difficulty in the last year, while recent research shows that children and young people in Ireland have a higher rate of mental disorder than elsewhere in Europe or the US.

‘A Vision for Change’ is the 26 County current mental health policy and has cross party support. Published in 2006, the policy was due to be implemented in full by 2016. However, progress has been slow, causing the Inspector for Mental Health Services to remark last year that mental health services were ‘stagnant and perhaps have slipped backwards in 2012’. Sinn Féin is committed to addressing these issues at local and national level.

Addiction Services

Amidst the discourse on the economic crisis the focus on the drugs crisis has been lost. However recent statistics indicate that there were 607 drug related deaths in 2011, the most recent year for which statistics are available. This is a stark reminder of how serious Ireland’s drug problem is and shows the horrific consequences of the failure of successive governments to make sufficient funding available.

These statistics clearly demonstrate the need to afford greater resources to drug use prevention, treatment and rehabilitation projects rather than reducing them. Chronic under funding has historically been a feature of the State’s response to the drugs crisis. Despite this, drugs services have already been subject to disproportionate cuts since the beginning of the recession.

While effective interventions are available to assist people to overcome addiction, or at least to minimise its most harmful effects, many of these crucial services are not available in our local communities. This means people who desperately need help sit on waiting lists, or must travel long distances for treatment, or in some cases never get access at all. This is wrong. When appropriate addiction services are not available it makes these people even more vulnerable to the predatory alcohol and drugs industries, locking them, their families and communities into addiction related harm.

Sinn Féin has a long history of confronting the causes and consequences of addiction. Local authorities can play an important role in supporting the provision of addiction and other harm reduction services. Our councillors will continue to use all their influence as public representatives – including their positions on Local/Regional/Rural Drugs Task Forces – to fight for delivery of these necessary supports to local communities.

Postal Services

Sinn Féin believes that the local post office is central to many local communities, especially in rural Ireland and we believe that is necessary to ensure that the service is protected.

In many rural communities the post office is a focal point for social interaction and closures are regarded as increasing the level of isolation and loneliness.

The recently published Grant Thornton report suggests that up to 557 post offices out of 1,150, face possible closure over the coming years with devastating effects for the communities they serve. The reality for many communities is that if the post office network goes, then many other businesses may go with them.

Sinn Féin believes that local post offices need to be at the centre of the rejuvenation of local communities and the local economy.

6. Strengthening Equality and Diversity

Irish Language and Gaeltacht Regions

Sinn Féin would task each local authority that has a Gaeltacht region in its remit to develop a local area plan for the Gaeltacht in that county. That would include Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Meath, Cork, Kerry and Waterford county councils. The plan would seek to ensure that Muintir na Gaeltachta can continue to exist and thrive as a distinctive cultural community with access to quality infrastructure and sustainable jobs and services.

This means ensuring that:

The indigenous resources of the Gaeltacht are developed in a way that will benefit all of the community and have respect for the natural environment.

Districts which have suffered population decline are assisted in encouraging new permanent residential growth.

The unique community on Gaeltacht islands are assisted in preserving their island culture, having regard to the disadvantage of their location and to the challenge of mass tourism.

That statutory and voluntary bodies are supported in serving the community in an inclusive and holistic manner.

Fundamental to this strategy would be to recognize that various districts of the Gaeltacht have substantial variations in Irish language use, in population levels and in infrastructure provision, and to form a vision of development for the various districts together with policies and objectives which will support their social, economic and cultural sustainability.

Equality

As Irish republicans, equality is at the core of what Sinn Féin believes in. We believe in a new republic, one in which all citizens are equal regardless of the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs, their sexual orientation, where they live or what they do.

Sinn Féin are calling for the equality proofing at a state wide and local level, through impact assessments, of Government policy and budgets as well as those of local authorities and other public bodies. This is to ensure that, in exercising their functions, local authorities, Government and public bodies do so in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome that result from socioeconomic disadvantage.

Sinn Féin councillors have been to the fore of the campaign for Marriage Equality with motions being passed in Councils across the island with the support of Sinn Féin.

We want to ensure that minority and vulnerable groups such as those in from new communities, travellors, elderly people and people with disablilities have equal status in our communities and our State and local government policies can lead the way for this.

7. Uniting Ireland

Sinn Féin is an Irish republican party. We are a United Ireland party. We are an all-Ireland Party. We believe in sovereignty, independence and equality.

Partition separated townlands, communities and regions. It undermined economic development and imposed additional costs for public services across Ireland. Partition never did and never will make sense. We are the only party with a strategy and policies for achieving Irish unity and independence. We are the only party bringing a distinctly republican and socialist analysis into the heart of Irish politics.

All Sinn Féin elected representatives will continue to pursue Equality, Change and Irish Unity at local government.

Sinn Féin is committed to:
Achieving Irish Unity through peaceful and democratic means.
Building All-Ireland and Cross Border Co-operation

Partition fractured the economy of Ireland and in particular the border counties. With vision and determination we can build a sustainable and equal economy across Ireland. Realising that vision requires the full and active participation of elected representatives at local government level, in the Assembly and the Oireachtas.

Harmonising structures across the island will deliver benefits for all communities, workers and business. The communities along the border continue to pay the cost of partition with reduced investment, high unemployed and emigration and disjointed public services.

To securing a Border Poll to allow the people to have their say on the future.
To addressing the legacy of partition and promoting national reconciliation.

Councils along the border provide back to back services that could be provided in a more efficient an effective manner through cross border working between councils. Sinn Féin is contesting and will win seats in all councils in the border region. We are the only party that can deliver greater co-operation and integration along the border.

"EP 2009: Fianna Fail","Introduction from An Taoiseach Brian Cowen TD

Fianna Fáil is deeply committed to the European Union and the great ideals which it represents. It has always been an enabler of Irish sovereignty and we believe that it will play as important a role in our future as it has in our past.

The elections to the European Parliament represent a potentially very significant moment in the relationship between Ireland and the EU.

At a time of unprecedented crisis both here and internationally, we believe that Ireland should remain true to its Euro-positive tradition – that it should send to the European Parliament people committed to constructively working with others.

The European Parliament, as a political institution, is growing in power and MEPs are taking decisions which positively affect our daily lives.

Over the next five years the Parliament will deal with a range of issues which are vital to our national and collective European interests. This document reviews some of these areas and outlines Fianna Fáil’s record of action and approach to the future.

Each of our candidates combines a lengthy record of deep engagement with European issues together with service to their communities. They are ready to be active and effective on our behalf.

I urge you to support and vote for our Fianna Fáil candidates in the forthcoming European Parliament elections on June 5th 2009.

Message from Mr Micheál Martin TD, Fianna Fáil Director of the European Parliament Elections 2009.

The European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the European Union.

Direct elections first took place to the European Parliament in 1979.

As a direct result of the Single European Act 1986, the Maastricht Treaty 1992, the Amsterdam Treaty 1998 and the Nice Treaty 2001, the European Parliament has secured substantial political powers across a range of policy areas.

The European Parliament has an equal power with the EU Governments (via the Council of Ministers structure) in bringing forward new EU laws under what is known as the co-decision procedure. This legislative structure covers very wide areas of policy-making including the fields of consumer protection, environment, transport, economic affairs, legal affairs, employment law, structural funds and food safety. New EU laws first come from the European Commission to the appropriate committee within the European Parliament. That is why it is so important that we elect effective MEPs who can represent our interests within the European Parliament as new EU directives and regulations are being amended and enacted. Moreover, we must continue to strive to communicate to the people of Ireland the nature and importance of decisions taken in Europe in a simple and concise manner.

The European Parliament is centrally involved in deciding how the annual EU budget, which is worth €130 billion per annum is spent by the European Union.

The European Parliament must approve all international trade agreements entered into by the European Union. No country can join the European Union until the European Parliament has approved the final accession agreement between an applicant country and the European Union.

This June, the people living in the 27 different member states of the European Union will elect 735 MEPs to the European Parliament. This is a political institution that is growing in stature and in international prominence.

MEPs, elected by the Irish people, will be taking decisions that will have a positive effect for our people, our country and the European Union.

The Fianna Fáil Party is an active and committed pro-European Party. We always have been and we always will be.

Fianna Fáil’s candidates in this election are of the highest calibre and will represent our country and the European Union within the European Parliament with a sense of purpose, understanding and commitment.

Bíonn tionchar dearfach ag cinntí Parlaimint na hEorpa ar Éirinn agus ar mhuintir na hÉireann. Vótáil ar son Fhianna Fáil ar an 5ú Meitheamh seo chugainn

Minister for Foreign Affairs Fianna Fáil Director of the European Elections 2009

Economic Growth and Recovery

Fianna Fáil in Government is working closely with the European Commission and within the Eurozone structure on the issue of reducing our budget deficit.

The European Commission has approved the recent plans as set out by the Irish Government to deal with our budget deficit, in accordance with EMU rules, over a five year period, as opposed to a two year timeframe.

Ongoing measures which the Irish Government have sought to introduce reforms and re-structuring to our banking and financial systems continue to be approved by the European Commission in a spirit of Co-operation.

The European Central Bank continues to be very supportive to Ireland at this difficult time.

Stimulating the Irish Economy

Supporting Irish economic recovery

The future interest of the Irish economy is best served by our country being at the very heart of the European Union project. Ever since we joined the European Union in 1973 one of our strongest selling points to investors around the world is the fact that we can access the European internal market. Our membership of the European Union is one of the significant reasons for 1,000 foreign companies being located in Ireland.

Backing the development of a smart economy in Ireland

Ireland must stay at the leading edge of developing and supporting new technologies if we are going to continue to maintain employment and entice new companies to locate in our country into the future. Ireland is home to many multinational companies which are world leaders in the areas of information technologies. There are also hundreds of thriving indigenous Irish companies involved in the research and technology sectors.

We must be to the forefront in developing and supporting new technologies as part of the Government’s economic strategy. This is vitally important if we are to remain competitive.

Policies pursued by the European Union support the development of the smart economy in Ireland.

The European Union has put in place a programme known as the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) 2007-2013. This initiative provides €52 billion to companies in Europe to support the development of new technologies.

In the first twenty months of the operation of this FP7 programme, 353 Irish projects secured over €83 million in funding under this FP7 initiative. This means that Irish companies are drawing down over €1 million a week in financial support from the European Union to support a variety of different technology related initiatives in Ireland.

Funding under FP7 provides financial assistance to a number of sectors including the fields of technology, research, transport, health, energy, social services, education and humanities, agriculture, food and fisheries.

Securing financial support and expertise under the 7th Framework programme for Research and Technological Development 2007 - 2013 compliments the work of the Innovation Fund set up by the Irish Government. These two programmes support the early stage development of intensive small and medium sized businesses involved in research and technology issues. These initiatives will help to maintain Ireland as a leading innovation hub in Europe.

Supporting the smart economy is a central component of both the EU Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth and of the European economic recovery plan. This is a vital element of the EU strategies to maintain jobs in the workplace, create new jobs and restore competitiveness.

2009 is the European Year for Creativity and Innovation, which highlights the importance of the technology sector to the European Union.

The EU Economic Stimulus Package

EU leaders at their Summit meeting on March 19th 2009 agreed the terms of a new European economic stimulus package.

The European Union agreed to provide €110 million to Ireland to assist in the construction of a new electricity Interconnector between the east coast of Ireland and Wales. This project is an essential piece of infrastructure for a number of reasons:
• It will connect our grid to a much larger energy market and help to reduce the cost of electricity.
• It will protect the future of our energy needs by establishing an important new supply route.
• It will add to the integration of EU energy markets which positively serves our strategic political and economic interests.

European Investment Bank support for key economic projects

Between the years 2004-2008 Ireland received €2.32 billion from the Luxembourg based European Investment Bank in support of a series of economic projects in Ireland.

These monies secured from the EIB have helped to upgrade several sections of the Irish motorway system, construct the Huntstown power plant in North Dublin, modernise the Aer Lingus Airbus fleet, develop the new passenger pier at Dublin Airport and construct new research and training facilities within the Irish third level sector.

The European Investment Bank will continue to play a very positive role in supporting economic development in Ireland in the coming years.

The EU Globalisation Fund

The European Commission administers a programme called the EU Globalisation Fund. This initiative is worth €500 million for the year 2009. It provides financial support to regions where over 1,000 job losses have taken place due to a company deciding to re-locate their businesses to take account of changing global conditions. In many ways, this programme is a key response of the European Union to the fact that we now live in a globalised world.

Following the job losses in the Mid West region of Ireland after the decision of the Dell Corporation to lay off 2,000 workers, the Irish Government is now in negotiations with the European Commission to draw down financial support from the EU Globalisation Fund to support the economic and social regeneration of the Limerick region.

Investing in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Ireland

European Investment Bank support for Irish Businesses

The European Investment Bank (EIB) signed agreements with three Irish banks on March 25th 2009 which makes available €310 million to Irish small and medium sized enterprises.

These cheap subsidised loans have given a boost to the Irish SME sector, which is the bedrock of the Irish economy. These monies are providing more credit for many SME companies who have had difficulties in recent months in securing adequate credit.

The EIB has changed its rules concerning its loan arrangements and this element of flexibility makes it easier to draw down EIB funding into the future.

This policy of flexibility has been matched by enhanced transparency concerning the monitoring and evaluation of these loan arrangements. It is a strict requirement on intermediary banks (i.e. Irish banks using EIB loans) that SMEs are fully informed of the role of the EIB in the specific loan arrangement and its impact on their financing conditions.

Fianna Fáil is confident that the EIB will make more agreements with Irish financial intermediaries this year to support the Irish SME sector which accounts for 55% of all employment.

To extricate ourselves from the economic problems that we face, will require implementing a series of economic initiatives across a range of different sectors. Drawing the maximum finance possible from the European Investment Bank is one such important step.

We must ensure that the SME sector survives and comes out stronger on the other side of this economic recession.

Reducing red tape in Europe for Businesses

It is a key priority for the EU institutions to cut red tape for SMEs by 25% by the year 2012.

Unnecessary administrative costs for businesses at a European level must be eliminated.

We fully support the provisions of the 2008 Small Business Act, which puts in place a 30 day payment period to companies being paid by public bodies in Europe.

We support new EU proposals, which reduce the costs for registering European wide trademarks from €1,600 to €900. In February 2009, the European Commission brought forward proposals that abolished financial reporting obligations for the smallest companies in Europe. These new rules will lighten the regulation which applies to small businesses.

Fianna Fáil welcomes the publication of a code of practice by the European Commission giving national contracting authorities in Europe guidance and practical advice as to how to improve SME participation in contract award procedures. This code addresses typical problems that SMEs face when they participate in public tenders, and it proposes practical solutions which include the following:
• Fixing the right size of the contract.
• Setting sufficient time to draw up tenders.

Fianna Fáil supports the initiative of the European Commission whereby a single access point will be set up for the citizens of Europe so that SMEs can be advised on the whole range of EU initiatives to support the SME sector in Europe.

Financial Markets

Bringing confidence back into the European Financial Markets

There is now a global recognition that there is need for sweeping changes in the governance of the international financial markets. The global economic downturn has exposed many deficiencies in the present regulatory system for the financial services sector.

The European Union is to the forefront in putting in place a new architecture to govern the regulation of the financial markets in Europe. But the operation of the financial markets is interlinked around the world. That is why it is so important that common standards and rules will apply to the operation of the financial markets all over the world, including in America, Europe, China and India.

We must have regulatory and supervisory systems in place for the financial services sector that are rigorous and can withstand the toughest of scrutiny. We must strengthen European Co-operation in the field of financial stability oversight. We must improve how EU supervisors should co-operate in a global context. That is why it is so important that international organisations, such as the G20, have agreed at a global level to substantially improve the regulation of the global financial markets. Confidence and stability in the EU financial markets system are the over-riding political priorities for all EU legislators.

New Rules to Supervise Financial Markets in Europe

We welcome the publication of the independent report of the high level group on financial supervision in Europe, carried out by the former head of the French Central Bank, Jacques de Larosière. This group was set up by the European Commission as part of the EU response to the turbulence on the international financial markets. This EU report recommends a number of important new changes for the future regulation and supervision of the EU financial markets system.

The de Larosière group’s mandate primarily covered the following issues:
• The organisation of the supervision of financial institutions and markets in the EU.
• The strengthening of European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning and crisis mechanisms.
• EU supervisory co-operation in a global context.

The de Larosière report contains 31 different recommendations including the following key proposals:
• The establishment of two new pan-European bodies that will monitor risk and co-ordinate the supervision of financial institutions in Europe. Existing national supervisors within the 27 member states of the European Union will continue to carry out the day-to-day supervision of financial markets within their respective countries.
• The establishment of a new European Systematic Risk Council that will gather information on all macro-economic risks in the EU.
• The establishment of a European System of Financial Supervisors, that will co-ordinate the future supervision of the EU banking, insurance and securities markets.
• The introduction of new regulatory and supervisory procedures for a number of key aspects of the financial services sector including credit rating systems, hedge funds, investment funds, deposit guarantee schemes, capital requirements for banks, accounting procedures, securitised products and the derivatives markets.

EU leaders at their March 2009 meeting agreed that the European Commission should bring forward draft legislation based on the de Larosière report. These proposals will require careful examination in the weeks ahead. EU Finance Ministers will be tasked to bring proposals based on these documents to the June European Council meeting of EU leaders.

The Lisbon Treaty

The European Union needs to update and modernise its decision making procedures. This modernisation of procedures will simplify decision-making processes within the EU institutions and it will help the Union tackle global problems such as climate change, international crime and energy security in a more structured way.

The Fianna Fáil Party fully accepted the decision of the Irish people as expressed in the Lisbon Referendum of June 2008. The Fianna Fáil Party has sought to address the concerns of the Irish people as expressed in this referendum result. The factors underpinning this result were complex and required detailed examination and reflection.

At the meeting of EU leaders in December 2008 an agreement was reached that in the event of the Lisbon treaty being ratified, all member states of the European Union will retain the right to nominate one member to the European Commission. This specific agreement demonstrates the ability of the European Union to reach consensus on complex institutional issues in Europe.

Our European partners are working very closely with us, in a spirit of openness and determination, in an effort to address the key concerns of the Irish people as expressed in the Lisbon Referendum in June 2008. The Irish Government is at present engaged with our European partners in seeking clarity on a range of political issues. We have received commitments that our positions in relation to tax, common security and defence policy, as well as family and ethical issues will be subject to firm and unambiguous legal guarantees. These were issues that caused worries for many people.

We have also secured a re-commitment by the EU on the principles of workers’ rights, social progress and public services. If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, this commitment will be re-enforced by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which contains important support for workers’ rights.

We are now working with our EU partners to finalise the actual texts of these specific, explicit and unequivocal guarantees. It is our political objective to ensure that re-assurances and clarity will be given to people in a meaningful way so that we can address the key concerns that the people had at the last referendum.

If we secure the legal certainties and assurances that we seek, and if we are satisfied with the content of these legal guarantees then the Fianna Fáil Party is committed to supporting a second referendum on the revised Lisbon Treaty arrangements. Those who oppose the holding of such a referendum are opposing the democratic right of the people to pass judgement on what is on offer.

The Lisbon Treaty reflects our values and supports our interests. It will result in a more efficient union, a more democratic union, a union that supports workers’ rights and a pro-competitiveness agenda. It will strengthen the role of national parliaments in the decision-making process in Europe.

We believe very firmly that the Lisbon Treaty is a necessary adjustment to the Union’s rules so that today’s larger Union can act in a more effective and accountable manner.

We see its extension of democratic oversight within the Union as important progress and believe that the European Parliament needs the Treaty’s reforms.

Within the Parliament we will continue to take a positive and active position in relation to the constitutional and administrative arrangements of the Union.

Promoting a Strong Social Agenda in Europe

Equal Opportunities

Ireland has clearly made great political and economic progress as a member of the European Union. But we should remember at all times that the European Union is to the forefront in supporting a range of social policies.

Economic, employment and social policies are interlinked and mutually productive. For example, European policies in the field of social development work in tandem with the EU Strategy for Growth and Jobs.

The European Union has always been based on shared values - human dignity, freedom, solidarity, equal opportunities and responsibility. As globalisation quickens the pace of change, it is essential that the European Union acts to preserve these values at all times.

One of the founding principles of the Treaty of Rome is a clear legal commitment to abolish discrimination in European society. Discrimination in Europe is prohibited on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, age and sexual orientation. Anti-discrimination legislation in Europe is one of the most advanced in the world.

Not everyone starts life from the same point. Therefore it is crucially important that we create and promote a policy of equal opportunities for all - especially in policy areas such as access to healthcare, education, pensions, social security and the labour market.

Fianna Fáil supported the designation of 2007 as the European Year of Equal Opportunities, which very successfully highlighted around Europe the key social policies being promoted by the EU institutions and EU Governments.

Fianna Fáil has also supported the successful initiative for 2010 to be designated the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.

Of the 78 million Europeans who are at risk of poverty 19 million are children. Population ageing and low birth rates are two major challenges that Europe is facing into the future.

The Challenges of an Ageing European Population

Life expectancy in the EU has risen by eight years since 1960.

The European Union must take account of an ageing population and we believe that ageing concerns must be mainstreamed into policy decisions to ensure the sustainability of social and economic policies at an EU level.

We support the principles as set out in the European Commission’s 2006 document The demographic future of Europe - From challenge to opportunity and welcome the policy of the European Union institutions to work in partnership with Member States to address the common challenges of an ageing Europe.

An ageing Europe also brings clear benefits of experience, knowledge and expertise. We must continue to encourage trans-European dialogue on ageing by putting forward European-wide lifelong learning and third-age information technology programmes.

The Operation of the European Social Fund in Ireland

Since joining the European Union in 1973, Ireland has received over €7 billion in financial support under the European Social Fund. These monies have primarily been used to help combat youth and long-term unemployment.

Under the EU Human Resources Operational Programme for Ireland 2007-2013, the European Union is providing €375 million to Ireland under the European Social Fund. The overall budget of this programme is €1.36 billion. These monies are being used to provide training courses for those who are unemployed, for people with disabilities, for early school leavers and for the marginalised in our society.

We live in an age of globalisation. To respond to the challenges and opportunities which globalisation creates for the Irish workforce the European Social Fund in Ireland is also supporting lifelong training courses which can be adapted to the realities of a globalised jobs market.

Addressing the Gender Pay Gap

Fianna Fáil supports the EU-wide campaign launched by the European Commission in March 2009 to help tackle the gender pay gap in Europe. Equal pay for equal work is one of the core principles of the European Union.

The 2009 European Commission report on equality between men and women confirms that, while progress has been made on the issue of gender equality, significant gaps still remain in several areas. The employment rate of women in the European Union has been steadily rising over the last number of years (58.3% for women as against 72% for men), but women still work in sectors where wages are lower. More than 40% of women work in health, education and public administration, whereas the figure for men in these sectors is half of this figure.

The European Commission campaign aims to raise awareness of these pay gaps and how the problem can best be tackled. This campaign is seeking to promote best practices on the issue of pay with employers, workers and trade unions around Europe.

Bridging the Digital Divide

Developments in information technology have revolutionised the way Europeans work, do business, spend their money and communicate. However, there is a danger that the opportunities that new technologies offer might create a divide between groups in society.

Fianna Fáil in Europe is pursuing a policy agenda to ensure that vulnerable social groups, including the elderly, those in remote areas and those on very low incomes, fully benefit from the opportunities that are available from new and evolving technologies.

The Social Partnership Model in Europe

Fianna Fáil supports the social dialogue model in Europe. This process brings together representatives from European employer bodies, trade unions and public authorities with the aim of discussing policy making in Europe in the field of social affairs. This social dialogue model is broken up into 36 different committees and these groupings are charged with bringing forward joint action plans and recommendations on the reform of European Social Policy. This model is very similar to the social partnership structure in Ireland.

The European Anti-Poverty Network also provides strong advice and input on many aspects of EU social policy making.

EU White Paper on Sport

The European Commission is playing a more important role in promoting sporting policy today than was the case in the past.

In 2007 the European Commission published an EU White Paper on Sport. This White Paper has formed the basis of the European Commission sporting policy that is being currently implemented.

Key issues being addressed by the EU White Paper on Sport include:
• Promoting volunteerism in sport in Europe.
• Developing public health strategies in the areas of public fitness to tackle problems such as cardio-vascular disease, obesity and diabetes.
• Encouraging increased engagement in sporting activities among the less well off and the disabled.
• Addressing the role of the EU in regulating and distributing sporting media rights, including in the new media areas of mobile communications and interactive services.
• Developing strategies to combat doping in sport.
• Introducing new initiatives to tackle racism in sport.

If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, sports policy in Europe will be subject to co-decision rules. This means that there will be a legal basis for sport in the EU treaties and this would make it easier to activate financial support measures for new sporting initiatives at a European level.

Tackling Mental Health Problems

We support the role of the European Commission in pursuing initiatives to promote best practice in the field of mental health.

Health services are not a treaty-based competence of the European Union institutions. However, where the European Commission has the support of the 27 Member State Governments it can implement programmes in the health field.

As a pan-European body, the European Commission is ideally placed to assess the best practices used in individual EU Member States in areas such as mental health policy. Other countries in Europe can then learn from and replicate these best practices.

Fianna Fáil supports the European Pact for Mental Health and Well Being, which was launched in June 2008.

There are five policy areas where the European Commission is seeking to put in place best practice in Europe:

• Mental health in youth and education. Mental health in the workplace.

• Prevention of depression and suicide. Mental Health in older people.

• Combating social stigma and social exclusion.

In improving awareness of the gravity and extent of mental health problems, the European Commission can play a valuable role in highlighting this serious health issue.

It is estimated that there may be as many as 210,000 people suffering from depression in Ireland.

EU Public Information Campaigns

The EU is to the forefront in promoting a number of public information campaigns including:
• Addressing global health risks through international cooperation.
• Highlighting the dangers of Aids.
• Promoting organ donation and transplantation.
• Raising awareness of the dangers of smoking.
• Tackling obesity, particularly among young people.
• Encouraging better eating habits.
• Combating rare human diseases.
• Marketing the benefits of the E111 European Health Insurance Card around Europe.

International Crime and Promoting Justice for all our Citizens

Organised Crime

We live in an internal market comprising a population of 500 million people from 27 different member states. One of the founding principles of the European Union is the right to move freely from one member state to the next. That is why it is of such fundamental importance that the EU Governments and the EU institutions intensify their efforts to promote police co-operation. There are 1.2 million police officers within the European Union alone.

Organised crime is international by nature and it requires a concerted and united international response if it is to be effectively tackled. Organised crime has evolved at a time of increasing globalisation and expanding international trade so the range of organised criminal activities has broadened and diversified. Organised criminal groups have built up large-scale international networks and amassed substantial profits from the illicit trafficking in drugs, trafficking in human beings, trafficking in weapons, counterfeit products, international fraud, cybercrime and the sale of child abuse images. The proceeds from these crimes are laundered and re-injected back into the legal economy, which further helps organised criminal activity.

The European Union has introduced a new framework whereby each of the 27 member states of the EU have had to set up an asset recovery office. These offices will operate in a structure that is similar to the Criminal Assets Bureau in Ireland and it will help national authorities around Europe to identify, trace, freeze, confiscate and seize the assets of criminals.

All stakeholders in Europe are working in the fight against organised crime via the EU Crime Prevention network.

We promote the exchange of information, in accordance with data protection rules, among police and judicial authorities in Europe within the competence of international organisations such as Eurojust and Europol.

We support the need to constantly review anti-money laundering legislation in Europe, so that these laws can be updated to take account of the rapidly changing nature of international crime.

Combating International Drug Trafficking The M.A.O.C-N Initiative

A new EU programme was set in up in September 2007 called the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics, known by the acronym M.A.O.C.-N programme.

This programme, which is headquartered in Lisbon, brings together the police, naval, intelligence, customs and revenue services from all the countries based along the west coast of Europe. All these services are now working together and sharing information so as to halt cocaine importations coming from South America and from West Africa into Europe.

Some of the most high profile drugs seizures which have taken place in Ireland over the past two years have been as a direct result of this successful M.A.O.C-N programme.

EU support programme in Afghanistan

At least 90% of all the heroin that is sold in Ireland comes directly from Afghanistan. That is why we support ongoing EU programmes to promote economic development and good governance in Afghanistan. Between 2007 and 2010, the European Union is supporting a range of different projects in Afghanistan at a cost of €700 million.

One of the key programmes that the EU is backing is the promotion of alternative livelihoods in rural Afghanistan so as to tackle opium production in this country. The EU is also supporting measures to combat corruption in Afghanistan and ensure the strengthening of democratic and public service structures.

EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012

The new EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012 will provide a single framework for all activities relating to drug abuse and trafficking in the EU.

The overreaching objectives of this action plan are twofold; to stem the supply of drugs and to reduce the demand for drugs. This is to be achieved via a new European Commission initiative, known as the European Alliance on Drugs which aims to raise awareness, particularly among young people, about the dangers of drug abuse.

In essence, what the European Commission is doing is to increase the number of information programmes that it is running to highlight the dangers of illegal drug abuse. Vulnerable groups in our society will be particularly targeted.

Steps will be taken to improve expertise in collecting data on drugs- related crime and the workings of the drugs market at both a local and a global level.

The European Commission is in a very strong position to gather information as to where the best treatment, educational and rehabilitation programmes are operating in Europe. Countries in Europe can learn from one another and implement best practice initiatives.

The European Union must work with other international organisations including with the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs to help reduce the global supply and demand for illegal drugs.

Combating child sex abuse in Europe

We welcome the publication by the European Commission in March 2009 of two new proposals to step up the fight against the trafficking of human beings, child sex abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography. These new proposals will provide better assistance for victims and tougher action against criminals responsible for child sex abuse and people trafficking.

The European Commission is also financing international organisations such as the European financial coalition against child sex abuse on the internet. This grouping facilitates closer Co-operation between police authorities, financial operators, internet providers, NGOs and private companies such as Visa, Mastercard, Ebay, Paypal and Microsoft to stop these horrific and illegal practices.

The European Commission is working with authorities from all EU member states to safeguard and protect children when using the internet, to stop cyber-bullying and the hideous practices of grooming children online.

Common European Asylum System

We support the need for a common European asylum system which is to be introduced at an early stage. The European Union is an area where the free movement of people is assured, so the introduction of such a common system for asylum within the EU would have very practical benefits. Such an arrangement under the Common European Asylum system must be fundamentally fair, transparent and humane. In the context of putting in place this policy, we welcome a new EU regulation to set up a new European Support Office. This will oversee all forms of Co-operation between EU member states concerning the operation of the common European asylum system.

Introducing an EU-Wide Missing Child Alert System

Fianna Fáil in Europe has advocated the creation of an EU-wide missing child alert system. Such systems play a very positive role in recovering missing or abducted children.

Activation of an EU-wide alert system would trigger the immediate forwarding to the relevant news media, border authorities, customs and law enforcement agencies of the details of a missing child, a photo, information about the disappearance or suspected abductor and, most importantly, a telephone number to call with information. Such a system would be especially effective in trans-border cases, where rapid and efficient cross-border co-operation is of the essence.

Energy and the Environment

Climate Change The European Union - tackling climate change

Climate change has been rightly described by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon as the “defining challenge of our age”. Our generation will be remembered as the first to be offered solid scientific evidence of the existence of climate change. It is now our responsibility to ensure that we will be remembered as the generation which took decisive action to arrest climate change.

The European Union fully supports the recommendations of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change. The international community must act now to limit the increase in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

There are countless benefits from the transformation of the European Union into a highly efficient, low emission economy. It will spur innovation, which can help job creation and build a low carbon future. The European Union is committed to reducing EU emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels by the year 2020 and by 30% as a contribution to a broader global effort.

EU leaders agreed a comprehensive set of proposals at their December 2008 meeting which sets out clearly how the European Union is going to specifically achieve these targets. This includes reforming the carbon trading emissions system which is the key EU tool for achieving emission reductions at least cost.

Global Co-operation

The European Union, by being to the forefront in arresting climate change must use every opportunity possible to ensure that the global international community support policies to arrest climate change.

America, Russia, China, India, Brazil and developing countries must all play positive roles in ensuring that ambitious climate change targets are reached.

Climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. That is why we welcome the fact that the next meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will take place in December 2009 in Copenhagen.

This meeting must map out the next serious efforts of the international community in arresting climate change. Reaching an ambitious Copenhagen agreement is not a choice, it is a political imperative. An agreement at Copenhagen later this year must build upon the Kyoto Protocol.

The European Parliament has the political power of co-decision with the EU Governments in climate change policy and is centrally involved in shaping European Union policy making on environmental issues, including through the work of the European Parliament Climate Change Committee.

Environmental Policies in Europe

The Fianna Fáil Party is working within the European Parliament, with the European Commission and with EU Governments on a range of different EU policies in the field of the environment, including the following:
• Promoting cleaner air in Europe.
• Regulating the chemicals sector in Europe by supporting what is known as the new Reach Directive. Supporting the biotechnology sector and protecting biodiversity.
• The protection of our soil and our natural eco-systems.
• Supporting the sustainable development of urban living.
• Improving waste management practices in Europe.
• The promotion of high quality water supplies in Europe.
• The EU directive on industrial emissions.
• The EU regulation on ozone depleting substances.
• National emission ceilings for atmospheric pollutants.
• The EU directive reviewing the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment. 
• Supporting broader eco-labelling measures.

Energy Policy

An Energy Policy that tackles Climate Change

Tackling climate change and energy security are policies that are inextricably linked.

That is why the European Union is pursuing the policy, with binding targets for all EU member states known as the 20:20:20 Programme. The 20% reduction in carbon emissions use will be matched by increasing alternative energy use by 20% by 2020 in Europe and by reducing energy demand in Europe by 20% by 2020.

Renewable Energy and Efficiency Programmes

Renewable sources of energy - wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power, tidal power, geo-thermal power and biomass - are all alternative energy uses to fossil fuels. This will help to reduce our dependence on greenhouse gas emissions, diversify our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels like gas and oil.

The growth of renewable energy sources stimulates employment in Europe and it creates cleaner and greener technologies.

We fully support the new EU directive on renewable energy which sets legally binding targets that 20% of all energy needs in all EU member states will come from the renewable energy sector and 10% of this target will come from the transport sector alone.

This directive also improves the legal framework for promoting renewable electricity. It requires national action plans that establish pathways for promoting renewable energy sources including bio-energy. This directive must be implemented by the year 2010.

€3.5 billion contained within the European Economic Recovery Plan is earmarked for energy investments, including offshore wind technology, inter-connectors, carbon capture and storage.

Irish projects, such as the North Sea component of the offshore wind energy initiative can benefit from a new €165 million fund to support the development of new wind energy projects in Europe.

The European Union has set the target of reducing energy use by 20% by the year 2020 by putting forward a series of proposals in the field of energy efficiency.

These proposals include energy efficiency measures for buildings and energy using products.

Those who regulate the energy sector in Europe, public authorities, infrastructure operators, the energy industry and the citizens of Europe all must work together in reaching these targets.

Energy Security

Guaranteeing energy security is a necessary prerequisite for the economic development and political stability of Europe.

The European Union is supporting these policies in three respects:
• Identifying priority infrastructure projects based on the medium to long term analysis of supply and demand. 
• Improving the existing energy processes in Europe by bringing forward new legislation.
• Creating and developing contractual relationships with third countries and regions, with the aim of ensuring permanent supplies and actively contributing to the diversification of energy resources.

The European Union is right to intensify its political discussions with Russia, Ukraine and with countries based in the Caspian Sea region concerning the protection of our future energy supplies.

We are equally committed to developing a stable, efficient and interconnected internal electricity and gas market in Europe.

We welcome the €110 million which has been given this year by the European Union in support of the construction of the new East-West electricity interconnector.

Sellafield Nuclear Plant

Fianna Fáil MEPs in the European Parliament regularly raise the lack of proper safety standards at the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria.

This storage facility for nuclear materials at the Sellafield nuclear plant known as the B30 pond is arguably one of the most serious problems facing the nuclear industry in Europe, let alone in Britain.

The B30 pond has been the point of refuge for serious amounts of nuclear materials since it first came into existence in 1959 and these dangerous substances need to be cleaned up as a matter of urgency.

This is on top of the very serious and unacceptable breaches of safety which take place at the Sellafield nuclear plant, including one which was only confirmed by the authorities running this facility on April 15th 2009.

Ever since the Thorp re-processing facility was given the go-ahead in 1993, there have been numerous safety breaches and it has been closed on many occasions.

Fianna Fáil MEPs made a comprehensive submission in 2007 to the British Government into the future of the energy sector in Britain.

We find it unacceptable that the British Government is seeking to build new nuclear facilities at Sellafield at a time when serious questions concerning a variety of different safety issues at this plant need to be seriously answered.

Agriculture and Fisheries

Agriculture CAP Health Check 2009-2013

In November 2008, EU Governments finalised their negotiations on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, known as the CAP Health Check. The agreement, which sets out how the CAP will function over the period 2009-2013, includes measures relating to milk quotas, market supports, additional funding for farm payments, rural development and reducing bureaucracy.

Ireland secured an outstanding deal under this agreement. The Fianna Fáil Party, at a national and at a European level, has an excellent working relationship with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Marian Fischer Boel.

Irish farmers, their families, rural communities and the Irish food sector will continue to benefit from close to €2 billion in EU transfers in direct payments, from rural development measures and from various market supports such as those being now provided for the milk sector.

Some €1.3 billion will be paid to Irish farmers under the annual Single Farm Payment Scheme, with the remainder paid through a number of co-financed Rural Development measures. In 2008, total EU and national payments to farmers amounted to €2.63 billion. The importance of the CAP in supporting farm incomes and job creation in rural Ireland is immense and its role in promoting environmental protection has been enhanced under the CAP Health Check.

The CAP Health Check deal ensures that around €25 million in additional funding will be available for measures to target specific sectors and regions in need of assistance from 2010. In addition, Fianna Fáil ensured that the rate of additional modulation has been minimised and has committed that all funds raised will be passed straight back to Irish farmers.

Between 2009 and 2013 a combination of some €1 billion of Irish exchequer, European Union and private funding will be unleashed for the benefit of rural communities. This is supporting the diversification of the rural economy and it will create 12,000 new jobs directly.

Key Farming Sectors

In 2007, Fianna Fáil MEPs led the campaign for the introduction of a ban on Brazilian beef imports coming into the EU marketplace. The decision to impose a ban on Brazilian beef was rightly made on the grounds that the same rigorous rules and procedures that are in place for European beef producers must also apply to countries that wish to export their products into the EU marketplace.

Ireland East MEP Liam Aylward carried out a key report into the future of the sheep and lamb processing industries in Europe on behalf of the European Parliament. This much acclaimed EU report sets out a blueprint for the reform of the sheep farming sector in Europe. This is a sector that needs financial support if it is to remain viable and competitive into the future.

Key elements of this report include the need for greater assistance to be given to market lamb products in Europe and in third countries and to reform the labelling regime that governs the sheep sector in Europe, so that consumers are fully aware of the place of origin of the lamb products that they purchase and consume.

We are committed to ensuring that the EU increases its support to the Irish dairy sector. Milk prices have fallen dramatically due to international conditions and not least from the current economic downturn. We have successfully pressed the European Commission to provide adequate market supports, particularly through export refunds and intervention, so that the Irish dairy sector can weather this period of market instability and we will continue to do so. Ireland has been to the forefront at meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in highlighting the need for market supports.

As part of the CAP Health Check, Fianna Fáil in Government secured additional milk quota for Ireland in preparation for the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, which is worth €100 million in additional milk production.

Exports of Irish dairy products and ingredients accounted for some €2.56 billion in 2007 and the potential for this sector

to grow further in the new policy environment post 2015 is enormous.

Fianna Fáil lobbied for financial support to help the Irish pig sector when it got into difficulty in December 2008. As a result, the European Union gave €25 million in support to the Irish pig sector.

Fianna Fáil in Europe is constantly engaging with the European institutions in an effort to reduce red tape from the administration of many CAP related initiatives. Unnecessary administrative burdens must be eliminated.

The Irish Food Sector

There are 40,000 people directly employed in the Irish food sector. Fianna Fáil is committed to ensuring that strong support is given to promote Irish food products at home and abroad. Agri-food exports (including beverages) were worth over €9 billion in 2007. Research and innovation is critical for our food industry to maintain its position at the forefront of the European and global marketplace.

It is essential that we respond to the needs of increasingly sophisticated and health conscious consumers. The consumer has a right to know the origin of a product being purchased and therefore we will be seeking to ensure that the necessary EU legislation is in place to guarantee the traceability of all meat products. Fianna Fáil in Government will be working very closely with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Marian Fischer Boel, and with the EU Commissioner for Food and Public Health, Ms Androllua Vassilou, on these very important issues.

The future of the CAP 2014-2021

The debate is already underway in Europe on budgetary priorities under the next EU financial perspective 2014-2021.

This means seeking agreement on the policies that will receive EU financial support from the EU annual budget during this period.

These ongoing discussions between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Governments are due to be finalised in 2011.

Fianna Fáil is committed to ensuring that there is a very strong and adequately funded CAP after 2013 and to guarantee that a strong agricultural production base exists within the European Union.

Ireland is a substantial net beneficiary from CAP spending. Fianna Fáil is determined that the CAP will continue to support Irish farmers and rural communities so that we can all the face the future with confidence.

We will, as we have always done, fight to ensure that the interests of Irish farmers, rural communities and the Irish food sector are fully protected.

Fisheries

Fianna Fáil MEPs have been centrally involved in the negotiating process with the European Commission to ensure that Irish fishermen secure strong fishing quota rights on an annual basis under the Common Fisheries Policy.

Fianna Fáil MEPs engage regularly with Irish fishing representative organisations to ensure that the interests of Irish fishermen and coastal communities are fully protected under EU fishing policies. We support the implementation of effective management and conservation measures at an EU and at a national level so as to rebuild our fish stocks and ensure a viable and sustainable livelihood for our fishermen.

Fianna Fáil MEPs arranged regular meetings with the EU Commissioner responsible for Fisheries, Mr Jo Borg to address ongoing concerns from an Irish perspective. This is complemented by the work that is carried out by MEPs within the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament.

We support the forthcoming review that will be carried out by the European Commission into the future operation of the Common Fisheries Policy. We will work with the representatives from the Irish Fishing industry and with other key stakeholders, to strengthen the current EU policy to benefit the Irish fishing industry.

Fianna Fáil welcomes ongoing EU support for the development of the aquaculture industry in Ireland. The Irish Aquaculture Sector has enormous potential and can offer coastal communities a very valuable source of job creation and economic growth.

Irish fish products are of the highest quality among European and global fish producers. We support measures to vigorously market Irish fish products both in Ireland and abroad.

We must seek to reduce as much red tape and eliminate as much unnecessary form filling as is possible under the Common Fisheries Policy.

We support the promotion of recreational fishing opportunities within the EU.

Education and Culture

EU Education and Training Programmes Erasmus

EU educational supported programmes are a ‘win-win’ for individuals, societies, enterprises and EU member states.

Irish students from our 41 third level colleges are benefiting tremendously from a number of EU supported educational initiatives.

In the academic year 2007/2008, 209 Irish teachers and trainers took part on the Erasmus programme and 1,820 Irish students participated on the Erasmus programme itself. This is the initiative whereby a student from one third level college can go and study for a period of up to one year in another EU country. Some Irish students even study in two or three more countries as part of their third level education.

By the year 2012, over 3 million people in Europe will have participated on the Erasmus programme. Now 160,000 students and 26,000 teachers a year in Europe take part in Erasmus programmes.

This policy of ‘mobility for all’ is an important element in providing better education, promoting higher practical language skills and supporting job creation. The ‘mobility for all’ aspects to EU backed education programmes is very important in a globalised world.

University Business Forum Project

The European Commission launched a University Business Forum in 2008 which provides a platform for the exchange of views on issues such as the employability of graduates, continuing education, professional university management and the promotion of University-Partnerships. This is part of the overall strategy of the European Commission to address what are known as ‘Europe’s future skills requirements up to 2020.’

School to School Partnerships

The EU, through the Comenius Programme supports school to school partnerships which encourage pupils from different European countries to work together on specific topics. It will help to encourage teacher exchange programmes in Europe as part of their training and promotes the use of foreign languages. More than 800,000 pupils in Europe were involved in the Comenius Programme in the year 2007.

The EU is also increasing support to help those who drop out of school under the Grundtvig initiative. This programme is targeted at over 16s.

Lifelong learning and vocational training opportunities are part of the EU educational programme, Leonardo Da Vinci. It is the objective of the European Commission to increase the number of vocational training places under the Leonardo Da Vinci programme from 60,000 in 2007 to 80,000 by 2013.

Schools E-Twinning Project

The e-twinning programme is an initiative which encourages schools to network with one another from different countries over the internet. 35,000 schools in Europe already are taking part in this e-twinning programme.

This helps to support young people to learn about other EU countries with the use of the most up to date information and communications technologies.

The EU Tempus programme supports university Co-operation from the 27 member states of the EU with universities from Africa, the Balkans, Central Asia and the Middle East.

Culture

Supporting Cultural and Linguistic Diversity in Europe

Fianna Fáil was to the forefront in leading the campaign to ensure that the Irish language became an official working language within the institutions of Europe.

We won this campaign and the Irish language became an official working language of the European Union on January 1st 2007. Already 52 new jobs have been created.

If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, there will be more powers of co-decision given to the EU institutions and this will mean the creation of more jobs, as the translation of EU Directives and Regulations only applies to the co-decision procedure.

The European Union, in the promotion of media rights, is very supportive of a wider use of languages. That is why there is a member of the European Commission with responsibility for multi-lingualism.

There are 23 official working languages in Europe, 60 regional and minority languages and some 175 migrant languages. As the European Union integrates more closely, we must always protect different cultural, linguistic and national diversities.

Promoting EU Culture Programmes

Under the EU Culture programme 2007-2013, the European Commission encourages co-operation between cultural projects around Europe, aiming to enhance the development of cross border co-operation between creators, cultural players and cultural institutions. A total of €400 million is available under this Culture programme and it supports the following specific objectives:
• Promoting the trans-national mobility of people working in the cultural sector. 
• Encouraging the trans-national circulation of works, cultural and artist products. 
• Supporting inter-cultural dialogue in Europe.

This EU Culture Programme 2007-2013 was to the forefront in promoting the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and the 2009 European Year for Creativity and Innovation.

We support the EU Media programme which supports a single European wide cinema network that brings award winning films to cinemas in every EU member state. This gives consumers real choice and the opportunity to see films from other EU member states.

We support the recent setting up of the European digital library called EUROPEANA, which was launched in November 2008. This provides European citizens with direct, multilingual access to our rich cultural heritage. Two million digitised objects are now accessible under these initiatives including photos, paintings, audios, maps, manuscripts, books, newspapers and materials from Europe’s museums, archives and libraries.

The Irish Peace Process

EU Support for the Irish Peace Process

The European Union is the greatest peace project in the world and has played a very significant role in supporting the peace process in Ireland. The European Union has been the largest donor to the International Fund for Ireland. It amounts to 40% of all monies spent under the IFI programme.

Following the announcement of the ceasefires in 1994, the European Union put in place the peace fund programmes.

Between 2007 and 2013, the Peace III programme will be worth €333 million to support projects that promote peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the border county region. Of this figure, the European Union has contributed €212 million. This initiative targets grassroots programmes that promote community development and social inclusion.

Between 2007 and 2013, the Interreg cross border programme will support the development of cross border economic links in a range of areas. The Interreg programme will be worth €256 million during this period and the EU contribution of this figure is €185 million.

The Interreg programme supports economic development and job creation in the border county region and in Northern Ireland. The Peace III and Interreg programmes are additional to mainstream structural fund initiatives such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.

Consumer Protection

EU - Protecting the Rights of Consumers in Ireland

The European Union is to the forefront in promoting and protecting the rights of consumers across a range of policy issues. Moreover, the European Parliament has an equal power with the EU Governments in bringing forward new consumer protection measures.

The European Parliament has an equal power with EU Governments in bringing forward new laws in the field of consumer protection issues.

The European Commission will name any airlines that impose hidden charges over the internet and do not comply with these new EU rules.

Higher safety standards for toys sold in Europe

EU institutions are strengthening and updating the RAPEX system which checks that toy imports coming into Europe comply with EU safety standards. This is as a direct result of breaches of safety standards found in some toys sold within the European Union which resulted in the re-call of millions of toys from the EU marketplace in 2008.

The European Union is working closely with the Chinese Government, where most toys sold in the world are manufactured to ensure that it will improve and update its laws regulating the manufacture of toys.

Shopping online

All airline companies that operate in Europe have to spell out clearly all the costs that are involved in purchasing an airline ticket online. Consumers will have the right to know all the separate elements concerning the cost of an airline ticket, including landing and insurance charges.

One area that the European Commission is looking carefully at is protecting the 150 million consumers shopping online.

The internet as a retail platform is here to stay - and we must be able to adapt to new online opportunities over the internet. 60% of people in Europe have access to internet use for shopping purposes and these figures will increase substantially in the coming years.

This new digital environment where online shopping exists must ensure that both consumers and businesses can prosper into the future. We must effectively break down the regulatory barriers which are holding back the complete development of an effective internal market within the European Union over the Internet.

The European Commission is looking carefully at the issue of whether the rules in place at the moment adequately protect consumers or not. Under existing EU laws, businesses in Europe have to provide concise information in all consumer contracts purchased over the Internet, including the main characteristics of the product, delivery time, the price inclusive of tax and redress issues.

The trader will have to deliver products to the consumer within 30 days. Clear remedies such as financial re-imbursement for late delivery, the repair and the replacement of the product will also be available to EU consumers who have purchased defective goods online.

Fair charges for Mobile Phone Users

We welcome new laws at an EU level that will ensure that the cost of mobile phone texting from abroad is reduced to €11 cent from €39 cent, which is a decrease of 66% in the cost of texting from abroad.

Irish people send on average 160 texts a month. This move will save Irish business people and holidaymakers millions of Euro in the cost of their mobile phone bills.

Highlighting the Health Risks from Personal Music Players

New EU public awareness campaigns are going to be introduced which will ensure that young people are made aware of the dangers of listening to personal music players at high volumes over a sustained period of time.

10% of people in the EU who listen to personal music players for more than one hour a day over a period of 5 year risk permanent hearing loss. This is a particularly worrying statistic for young people, who are such large users of personal music players.

The European Union is also backing the introduction of new technologies for companies that manufacture personal music players to minimise the dangers of overuse.

EU Consumer Market Scoreboard

Fianna Fáil supports the regular publication of what is known as the EU Consumer Market Scoreboard.

This discloses the prices of energy, telecom and financial services products that are sold in each of the 27 member states of the European Union.

This scoreboard also highlights the standards of satisfaction and complaints that applies in these sectors.

Transport and Telecoms

EU Transport Policy

Transport is more than just a sector of our economy. It connects our society together. The free movement of persons and goods that is at the very heart of the construction of Europe would not be possible without an efficient transport system.

As an island, Ireland has very specific transport characteristics and concerns. We are working to ensure that even though we may be at the geographical periphery of Europe, Ireland remains at the heart of EU transport policy

The European Commission in June 2009 is due to bring forward a communication outlining the future direction of European Transport Policy. We must work within the EU to build a transport system that can meet the modern challenges such as globalisation, diversity of energy uses, climate change, and security threats while continuing to meet the needs of industry, tourism and individuals.

Road Transport

The community policy objectives for road transport are to promote passenger transport services, to create fair conditions for competition and to promote and harmonise more environmentally friendly technologies. European road policy aims to promote a system of sustainable mobility that is fair and efficient and that reduces the negative effects on the environment.

The transport sector is responsible for 28% of EU CO2 emissions, and 84% of this figure emanates from road vehicles.

With our EU partners, we are working towards upgrading and improving our road networks and changing road user behaviour to minimise the impact of road transport on CO2 emissions.

99% of Ireland’s domestic freight is transported by road. We support the European Trans-European Networks in Transport programme (TEN-T). TEN-T policies for Ireland have resulted in the upgrading of large sections of our road network.

As an exporting country, we carefully monitor ongoing EU rules governing the Irish and European haulage industry.

We work with our EU partners to protect all road users and those who depend on road transport for their livelihood. Existing legislation establishes minimal standards for working time, driving and rest periods, including enforcement and the use of tachographs. The EU also promotes and upholds passenger rights and safety standards, and promotes fair competition in the road haulage and road transport markets. EU co-operation is especially important to protect cross-border road users and passengers.

Fianna Fáil supports the development of intermodality in road transport, including the ongoing development of links between our road networks and rail, air and shipping systems.

Road Safety

In 2007, 43,000 people died in road accidents in Europe, with a further 1.7 million people injured.

Fianna Fáil advocates the approach of targeting the three key areas of infrastructure, driving behaviour and vehicle standards to reduce road deaths across Europe. This policy programme will be at the core of the European Road Safety Programme 2011-2020.

We support the European Road Safety Charter, which brings together representatives from the EU institutions and all interested parties in an effort to share ideas and best practices to reduce the number of deaths that take place on our roads. However, the European Union needs to do more to reduce road deaths in Europe and to this end we are pushing for more co-ordinated action and exchange of best practice at a European level.

We support the establishment of the eSafety Aware initiative which seeks to incorporate the newest technologies into road safety campaigns and to create awareness of eSafety.

Air Transport Policy

Ireland’s geographical position as an island on the edge of Europe means that ensuring an efficient air transport service is essential for our economic development.

We believe that to maximise Ireland’s desirability as a tourism and business destination, Europe’s air transport policies must continue to take account of rising passenger numbers, advances in technology and climate change concerns.

We support the ‘Single European Sky’ initiative which is designed to ensure that the European aviation industry becomes more competitive and respects the environment. This programme reduce flight times and fuel consumption and this will help to reduce airline costs and introduce safer, greener and cost efficient flights. At the core of the Single European Sky package is greater co-operation in the policy area of air traffic control.

We welcome the work of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in developing new technologies in the field of air traffic management technologies. The EASA promotes the highest common standards of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation at a European level.

Fianna Fáil has supported new EU rules that ensure that passengers are adequately compensated if a flight is delayed by over two hours or more, if a flight is cancelled or if a person is denied boarding.

Maritime Safety

90% of all EU freight outside the EU is seaborne and 400 million passengers embark every year at European ports.

It is essential that shipping and maritime operations are carried out with full respect for the safety of passengers and crew and for the health of our environment.

Therefore, we welcome progress made by the EU institutions on a series of proposals to reform the maritime sector in Europe.

At the heart of these reforms is a commitment to passenger safety and the protection of the environment. Concretely, this entails ensuring that sub- standard shipping is prohibited in European waters, verification of the sea-worthiness of vessels, reducing the risk of maritime accidents and minimising the environmental impact from maritime transport.

EU institutions work very closely with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) on many of these EU proposals.

Freight Transport by Sea

Fianna Fáil supports the Marco Polo initiative, which seeks to support the movement of freight transport on European roads to sea, rail and inland waterways.

We believe that Ireland as an island stands to gain a lot from a strong European short sea shipping policy. Short-sea shipping carries 41% of all tonne-kilometres of freight transport in Europe.

Development of Information Technology in European Transport

We support the development and promotion of measures to change transport behaviour in order to reduce congestion and environmental impact.

We welcome the work that is carried out under the EU’s Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), which applies the most up to date information and communication technologies to the transport sector to address congestion and emissions. Examples of Intelligent Transport Systems applications in road transport include urban and motorway traffic management and control systems, electronic toll collection and route navigation.

We support the EU Galileo project, which is an independent European satellite navigation system supporting improved transport operations across a range of forms.

Telecoms

The EU is to the forefront in ensuring that the telecoms sector in Europe is modern, effective, competitive and accessible to all. 250 million people in the EU use the internet alone, making the EU the biggest online market in the world. Telecoms policy in Europe supports job creation, new information technology networks and services that reduce prices for consumers.

The EU supports this objective by promoting the following measures:
• Supporting new regulatory measures to break up competition bottlenecks in the telecoms market in Europe where they still exist.
• Reforming radio spectrum management into a more market orientated, efficient and consistent structure. This will give a boost to the European wireless industry and support the ‘broadband for all’ initiative in Europe, whether in big cities or in less populated areas.
• Under the i2010 roll-out plan for the telecoms sector there will be increased support for the provision of Government services online.
• Given that the information, communications and technology sectors account for 26% of overall research expenditure, efforts to pool research at an EU level must intensify if we are to maximise the benefits for the European and Irish economies from such important research activities. This includes the public private partnership arrangements.
• The European Union will lead from the front in developing the internet of the future which will replace our current network and service infrastructures.

Foreign Affairs

EU Enlargement

May 1st 2009 marks the 5th anniversary since ten new countries acceded into the European Union.

It was under the Irish Presidency of the European Union in the year 2004, at a time when Bertie Ahern TD was the President of the European Council and Brian Cowen TD was Chairman of the Council of European Foreign Ministers that ten new countries successfully acceded into the European Union.

We support the enlargement process in Europe, taking into account the well established principles known as the Copenhagen criteria and the accession negotiations process.

The historic unification and stabilisation of the European continent would be left incomplete without the gradual integration of the Western Balkans into the EU. We support the close social, political and economic ties that are being built up between all the member states of the European Union and with countries in the Balkans.

Accession negotiations between Croatia and the European Union are advancing well and may be completed by the end of this year. We support European facilitation involving border disputes which exist between Slovenia and Croatia.

The European Union is contributing to bring peace and stability to Kosovo through a European Security and Defence mission, the appointment of a special representative and through the EU contribution to the work of the international civilian office. We support the greatest possible involvement of Kosovo in the stabilisation and association process.

The European Union is supporting the normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo, including mutual participation in regional co-operation activities. One of the basic conditions for stabilisation and peaceful developments in the Western Balkans is Serbia’s prospects of becoming an EU candidate country. We welcome the full co-operation that is being given by political leaders in Serbia with the International Criminal Tribunal based in the Hague.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has achieved EU candidate status.

The Stabilisation and Association Agreement outlining closer social and political ties between the EU and Albania is in force. Montenegro has also signed and implemented a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU.

The European Union is working closely with the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina so as to achieve a greater degree of political consensus that has delivered so much progress in the other parts of the Balkan region.

EU Relations with Third Countries

European Neighbourhood Policy

The European Union’s relationship with Russia is one of the most challenging of our times. Russia is the third most important trading partner for the European Union.

The security of energy supply and demand is a key component of this relationship. But the European Union and Russia will have to work more closely together in an effort to ensure that the principles of the energy charter treaty, namely transparency, reciprocity and non-discrimination are fully enforced. 25% of all gas and oil supplies within the European Union emanate from Russia but 70% of all Russian revenues come from the European Union.

The European Union must continue to engage with Russia on a variety of global political issues, including the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan and the Balkans.

The European Union must intensify our contacts with Russia in the areas of visa facilitation, customs co-operation, educational exchanges, scientific research and world trade.

The European Union must reinforce the need for the freedom of the press in Russia to be respected at all times. We support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries like Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova as part of this European partnership strategy.

The United States of America

EU-US relations have had a positive and fresh start under the new administration of President Obama. EU leaders had a very successful meeting with President Obama in Prague on April 5th 2009.

The European Union is working very closely with the American Government in addressing global economic challenges. On the issue of climate change, the European Union is working closely with the American Government, in an effort to secure a new agreement to tackle climate change at the forthcoming meeting in December in Copenhagen of the United Nations Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.

We are equally committed to implementing the Millennium Development Goals.

We are working closely together on a range of issues including in Afghanistan.

We support the Middle East peace process and we are working with the American Government on many of these issues via the Quartet structure.

The Middle East

The European Union must not give up on the vision of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and in Gaza, living alongside the state of Israel. But the re-construction of Gaza requires a durable solution, as part of a peace process to which all parties are committed. We need a return to substantive and comprehensive peace talks.

The European Union is supporting the re-construction of Gaza in the form of humanitarian assistance to the level of €42 million through what is known as the PEGASE programme.

We support the work of the Arab Peace initiative in terms of promoting peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.

China

China is the largest trading partner of the European Union. The European Union is working very closely with the Chinese Government on a range of social, economic and political issues under the EU-China Trade and Co-operation agreement. We support the transition of China to become an open economy based upon the rule of law and a respect for human rights. We support the ongoing integration of China into the world economy and the process of economic and social reforms that is taking place in China.

India

The European Union Action Plan on India was updated in 2008. This plan strengthens economic, social and political relations between the European Union and India in a range of policies including in the areas of trade, investment, transport and the environment.

The European Union is providing €470 million to India between the years 2007-2013 to support the implementation of the EU Action Plan on India and to improve education and health services in India.

Latin America

The European Union is the largest investor in both Central and South America.

Between 2007-2013, the European Union is providing 3 billion to Latin America to support a number of programmes including in the fields of drugs, migration and relations with civil society.

The European Investment Bank is also authorised to support economic projects in Latin America to the level of €2.8 billion between 2007 and 2013.

The European Union and the Developing World

European Co-operation in Achieving Development Goals

The European Union is the largest donor of development aid in the world. In 2008, EU Member States and the EU institutions contributed over €49 billion as aid to the developing world. Poverty eradication is not something that any member state can achieve alone. Development policy is an area where, by acting together, EU member states can make a real difference.

We support the full implementation of the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and the Division of Labour in Development Policy adopted in 2007. Donors are now encouraged to join forces on particular development aid projects and avoid the duplication of activity. This will help to ensure the more effective spending of development aid.

European Union development aid is allocated in a framework that aims to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are implemented by 2015. The MDGs are international goals, set by the 189 members of the United Nations in the year 2000. They seek to eradicate poverty and promote social development in the poorest countries of the world.

These goals include tackling HIV/aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, providing primary education for all children, improving health services, providing safe water and sanitary facilities and supporting good governance, the rule of law and democracy in the Developing World.

Fianna Fáil in Europe believes that the EU approach to development must tackle the causes as well as effects of poverty and that the spending of EU development aid must be carefully monitored and assessed.

Protecting Future Generations

We support policies which will put in place programmes that provide primary education to all the children living in the Developing World, in accordance with the Millenium Development Goals.

There are nearly 200 million children aged between 5 and 14 involved in child labour around the world at present. Child labour includes agricultural work, domestic work, factory work, child soldiers, child trafficking and many other forms of exploitation.

The European Union is working closely with the International Labour Organisation in the fight against child labour. The European Union is supporting a range of projects under the European initiative on democracy and human rights to combat child labour in many parts of the world including in Brazil, India, Egypt and in Morocco. Fianna Fáil believes that international efforts and co-operation between governments and industry must be intensified to bring an end to child labour practices around the world.

We applaud the work of The European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which has a budget of €1.1 billion (2007-13) and has funded actions to rehabilitate former child soldiers in Angola, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone, to combat child trafficking in West Africa, to combat sex tourism involving children and to eradicate female genital mutilation.

Fianna Fáil believes that education, child labour concerns and gender issues should be mainstreamed into all EU aid and development policies.

Sustainability of Food Supply

With the world rising in population by 75 million people a year, the issue of ensuring food security is now a key EU political priority. There has been a dramatic rise in the price of food in many parts of the world in recent times. Fluctuations in commodity prices threaten social, political and economic stability and we believe that sustainable development is dependent on the stability of food supply and pricing.

The European Union has already agreed to provide €1 billion as a food facility for the Third World. €800 million of this financial commitment will be made available this year. Already a €314 million package of projects to support agriculture and improve the food security situation in 23 developing countries across the globe has been adopted. Further programmes will follow, targeting 50 developing countries in total.

Fianna Fáil welcomes the European Union’s targeted response to pressing food supply needs, but believes that an increased emphasis must be put on protecting long term food supplies.

International Co-operation for a Better Future

Fianna Fáil supports the efforts of the European Union in implementing a joint EU-Africa strategy. This will foster closer co-operation between our peoples in the fields of social, education and political policies. These include the policy areas of trade, agriculture, migration, research, climate change and the energy sectors. In a globalised world our concerns are shared and we must work together with all our international partners to address issues of climate change, energy security, human rights and security.

Human Rights

Ireland has a long and respected tradition of standing up for minorities and the repressed all over the world. We believe that Ireland can further advance the need to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms by working with our EU partners.

The European Union is one of the leading political forces in promoting human rights throughout the world. The EU’s position as a leading global trading bloc has resulted in strong international links and considerable political influence.

Fianna Fáil believes that the EU should continue to use this influence to promote the principles of human rights, tolerance and respect for all that unites Europe today.

The EU must continue to speak out against torture and repression of free speech and must offer support to human rights defenders throughout the globe. The advancement of the principles of social and economic justice must influence all EU internal and external policies.

"EP 2009: Fine Gael","Executive Summary

The elections to the European Parliament on 5th June are fundamental to the future role and influence of Ireland in Europe. Europe holds the key to resolving many of the challenges that face us. Europe will play a key role in resolving issues such as regulating international banking, an effective approach to climate change and economic recovery.

Fine Gael is Part of the Strongest Team in Europe.

In an expanded Europe of 27 Countries, and with just 12 MEPs out of a total of 736, it is vital that Ireland’s interests are represented by the strongest team in the European Parliament. Fine Gael is that team. As members of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament – The European People’s Party (EPP) – we work alongside many government parties across Europe. Our EPP colleagues include President Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany.

Lisbon – Good for Europe, Vital for Ireland.

Fine Gael strongly supports the Lisbon Treaty. We argued in favour of a Yes vote in the last referendum. Events since then have absolutely reinforced our view that the ratification of the Treaty is vital for Ireland. We will once again support the Yes campaign in the referendum later in 2009.

Fine Gael’s Vision of the European Union.

Fine Gael believes that the EU must listen more to the concerns of its citizens, and Irish people must be given more information about how the EU works. We propose the creation of an EU Citizen’s Officer in Ireland to offer to the people and to the Oireachtas independent objective advice on issues such as EU legislation and policy, and to act as a watchdog for the public good.

We also want to see the means by which Ireland ratifies treaties improved to give people more information, through the option of referring treaties to the courts to get clarity on what each treaty’s constitutional implications are.

We oppose the government’s opt-out from Lisbon’s provisions on judicial and home affairs, believing that opt-out will hinder our fight against crime.

We also want to see the Oireachtas’s role in scrutinising European issues strengthened to give it a real role on behalf of Irish people in reviewing EU laws and directives.

We also want to see an audit of how European law is implemented in Ireland, to ensure laws as implemented in ways that do not create bureaucracy or disadvantage Irish industries in Europe.

The European Economy – Vital for jobs.

The EU played a critical role in our economic development over the past three decades. Fine Gael believes that the European Union can play a key role in our recovery. A key part of that recovery will be the reform of the banking sector and creating the right regulatory structures that protects citizens interests into the future.

Agriculture – Irish interests must be protected Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been crucial to the success of Ireland’s membership of the EEC and EU. The CAP however does not stand still, and further reform of it will emerge post 2013.

It is vital that Ireland has a strong and powerful voice in the European parliament to defend Ireland’s interests in any reform of CAP. We must not sacrifice Irish agriculture in any deal, and Fine Gael will be a strong campaigner and voice for Irish agriculture in Brussels and Strasburg.

The Review of the EU budget will focus on agriculture. Fine Gael will insist that Europe develops an agriculture policy first and then seeks the resources to implement the policy at EU level rather than merely cutting policy to fit a budget. We must defend our share of the agricultural budget in the post 2013 era.

Fine Gael believes that agricultural policy must defend the family farm structure in Ireland. The EU must support sustainable agricultural production by providing product-price stability and income stability to farming families. The EU market is vital for our agricultural exports and Fine Gael will work to ensure that Irish agriculture is focused on supplying, and is promoted in, the EU market.

Fine Gael fully recognises the importance of passing on farms to the next generation. The family farm remains at the heart of rural Ireland and must be defended. In particular we believe that the European Union in its policies must work to encourage young people to remain in farming, and encourage young farmer installation.

Fine Gael believes that in all future World Trade Talks, ""equivalence"" should inform any E.U. approach to WTO negotiations. In other words, the same set of standards relating to animal welfare, environmental standards of production, the use of veterinary medicines, etc must be applied when allowing goods to be sold in the European market. Europe’s shoppers should be able to know that all foodstuffs available on the shelves are safe and ethically produced. Europe should require producers in other continents to achieve the same high standards of control, production and safety with their products as are required of European producers, as a condition for access to markets in Europe.

Common Defence and Security Policy – Guiding Principles Relations within Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world have been transformed over the past two decades. Fine Gael wants any EU common security and defence system to be guided by five key principles:
1. The commitment to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations (UN);
2. The commitment to the pursuit of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, and a promise never to use either type of weapon;
3. The commitment to providing peacekeeping and peacemaking operations;
4. The commitment to respect the right of other EU States to enter other military alliances, or to be neutral, as they choose.
5. The right of Ireland to opt-in and opt-out of aspects of a mutual defence and security system on a case-by-case basis.

Protecting the Environment and Climate Change Climate change is one of the many issues where a co-ordinated approach from across the EU is vital. Europe set clear reduction targets in March 2007 and has shown a willingness to work with international bodies to make a meaningful contribution to dealing with the crisis. No other region in the world is better suited to provide global leadership on this issue and to stimulate others by its own actions than the European Union.

Fine Gael has produced a detailed and radical policy programme called ‘Rebuilding Ireland’, containing a visionary 11 billion Euros investment programme will see significant State intervention to rapidly promote more sustainable energy and transport. Our plan launched last March, will not merely change the country’s direction and investment in the green economy, but will create 100,000 jobs to turn Ireland into a low carbon economy.

The ability of Europe to take a set of Europe-wide policy initiatives on an issue as sensitive and vital as climate change shows the importance of the EU is helping shape all our futures. Fine Gael is committed in the EPP and in the European Parliament to help in its policies to counteract climate change.

This year’s European elections will be vital for Ireland. The Irish economy has been devastated by the economic collapse and by the chaos in the national finances. The experience of Iceland, which was thrown into chaos by its economic collapse in recent months, shows what can happen to small countries outside the European Union in times of economic turbulence. Now, more than ever, Ireland needs the European Union.

The economic, security, environmental and social challenges facing Ireland today, while diverse, are linked. No one state on its own can deal successfully with these issues. Together, our Union of nearly 500 million people can. For the challenges facing Ireland are the challenges facing Europe also. We can help and learn from each other.

By voting for your Fine Gael candidates you can ensure that Ireland remains at the Heart of Europe. Fine Gael is a member of the largest and most influential party in the European Parliament, the European People’s Party (EPP). Our MEPs have earned a reputation as being among the most hard-working and effective members. We offer the best team, in the most influential party in Europe. No party has a better team.

Our candidates in this election are:
• Dublin: Gay Mitchell, MEP
• East: Mairead McGuinness MEP & Senator John Paul Phelan
• North West: Jim Higgins, MEP & Senator Joe O’Reilly.
• South: Colm Burke, MEP & Sean Kelly

Every one is worth supporting in their own right. Gay Mitchell is one of the most experienced public figures, a talented Dubliner, former Minister for Europe and for the last five years Dublin’s leading MEP, able to fight Dublin’s corner in the corridors of power in Brussels. Mairead McGuinness, one of our outgoing MEPs for East (formerly called Leinster), is hard working and straight talking - a food policy expert who leads the debate on food, farming and environment issues at EU, national and local level. She is joined on the ticket in East by Senator John Paul Phelan, Fine Gael spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the Seanad, and at 30 one of the party’s most energetic, talented and exciting new politicians to emerge.

Jim Higgins, a former cabinet member and outgoing MEP for North-West, is widely respected in Brussels and Strasburg for his knowledge and insight. His running mate, Senator Joe O’Reilly, is himself no stranger to Strasburg. He is known for his wide-ranging and informative contributions to national and European policy as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and of Seanad Éireann. He has been a long-term campaigner on disability issues.

Colm Burke, our outgoing MEP for South, has won international praise for his hard work and commitment to policy within the parliament. He is joined on the ticket by Sean Kelly, a former president of the GAA, who brings with him exceptional skills and insight from his years running Ireland’s biggest and most successful sporting organisation, an organisation that touches every community and family on the island.

They are an exceptional team, combining youth and experience, policy commitments and community links. No party can offer a team containing people with such a range of talents.

Whether you are a new voter, or someone who has voted many times in the past, my message to you is simple: in this time of economic crisis, when jobs are being lost, when the economy is in difficulty, Ireland today more than ever needs to elect MEPs who are up to the job. Ireland needs the best team, and Fine Gael I know has the best team, ready to defend Ireland’s interests, and your interests, in Europe.


Ireland belongs at the heart of the European Union. Europe has changed Ireland’s role in the world. We are an equal member of one of the biggest and most influential groups in the world. Membership of the European Union has seen Ireland make unprecedented economic and social progress. Europe had been good for us.

The recent economic downturn demonstrates how important it is that we maintain close links to Europe. Membership of the Eurozone afforded us a protection.

Fine Gael joined the European People’s Party because we believe in its Christian Democratic principles, its commitment to communities and to human rights. Our Party leader Enda Kenny T.D. has been Vice-President of the European People’s Party since 2006. He and our MEPs have at all times advocated the principles of Fine Gael and the EPP.

We have advocated and fought for many progressive policies in the past and we will continue to do so in the future.

Our policy document for the 2009 European Elections outlines many of these policies. With your support we intend to implement them.

Billy Timmins, TD is Fine Gael TD for Wicklow and Fine Gael spokesperson on Foreign Affairs. A former army officer who served on peacekeeping missions with the United Nations in Cyprus and Lebanon, Deputy Timmins has been a TD since 1997.

The European elections

The European Parliament is a key part of the structures of the European Union. In the new parliament Ireland will have 12 MEPs, a reduction of one since 2004.

The state is divided into four European constituencies. They are
• North-West (formerly called Connacht-Ulster)
• East (formerly called Leinster)
• Dublin
• South (formerly called Munster).

Every constituency in the 2009 European elections will elect 3 MEPs.

1: The European People’s Party - Fine Gael’s Grouping in Europe

Though each country elects MEPs to the European Parliament, a country’s MEPs do not sit as part of a national delegation, but join one of the European political parties in Parliament. Fine Gael is a long-time member of the European People’s Party (EPP), the biggest party in parliament with 36% of all seats.

The EPP has MEPs from Christian Democratic parties from all over Europe. Its member parties sit in many governments in Europe and counts many presidents and prime ministers among its members, for example President Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny was elected to be one of the party’s vice-presidents in 2006.

The EPP has been committed to equality of opportunity, social justice and reward for effort and enterprise. It stresses the rule of law and human rights, backs full equality for people irrespective of gender, and supports the protection of minorities and the rights of the child. Membership of the EPP gives Fine Gael real influence, an influence we have used in Government and opposition.

The European People’s Party has clear-cut policies on a range of issues.

On the Economy:
• The creation of new jobs. We need to continue reforms, invest in education, life-long learning and employment in order to create opportunities for everyone.
• A co-ordinated policy to ensure the Europe-wide recession does not descend into a depression. European governments need to coordinate fiscal and monetary policies.
• The international financial architecture must be rebuilt. European regulations alone are not sufficient for global financial markets - we need to increase overall transparency and surveillance. Banks must again focus on their vital function to secure citizens’ savings and provide liquidity for our economies.
• The current economic recession is an opportunity to increase our investments in “green technologies”. We want to position Europe as a world leader in this sector in order to boost our economic growth and create more jobs and at the same time make Europe less dependent on fossil fuels.

Terrorism & crime:
• The EU’s first security priority is counter-terrorism. The Union should build formal links of close cooperation between the Commissioner for Freedom, Justice and Security, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and Europol’s Director, and improve the synchronization between their work and the global activities of the EU and its member states. Europol’s operational capabilities have to be strongly improved.
• Fighting against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires more coordinated action. That includes improving the operational capabilities and resources of the border control agency FRONTEX. 
• Applying a joint asylum policy, stepping up the implementation of a Blue Card system for legal immigration and establishing close partnerships with the countries of origin of illegal migration.


Agriculture and Green Technology:
• A renewed agricultural policy must cope better with the volatility of markets and strike the right balance between a secure food supply, sustainability and competitiveness, while keeping food affordable and of good quality.
• Europe should become market leader in green technology based on more and better research and development.
• The share of renewable energy must be increased to at least 20% of the energy mix in 2020. (Fine Gael has set an even more ambitious target, of 33% by 2025 in our ‘Renewing Ireland’ document launched earlier this year. We believe we could even exceed that based on the contents of our plan.)

The Family
• National policy makers have to improve the viability of social security systems. Pension reforms in Europe must be undertaken so that the effective age of retirement adapts to demographic developments.
• Family policies have to be even more integrated into our national policies. Family-friendly policies that improve flexibility for working parents are urgently needed. Better childcare and housing policies have to be provided, family-friendly fiscal policies must be introduced and parental leave for both working parents should be encouraged.
• Education is crucial to our future growth and prosperity. Higher levels of education increase employment prospects for everyone. Life-long learning is essential in order to meet the new challenges posed by technological advancement and globalization and as public sector costs increase, advantageous cooperation with the private sector should be explored.

2: The European Parliament

The European Parliament is a unique body, a parliament that sees directly elected parliamentarians from all twenty-seven member states sit together in one body to help decide the future of the Union.

Parliament plays an active role in shaping the European legislation that affects every citizen of the Union. Among the areas where it plays a crucial role are environmental protection, equal opportunities, consumer rights, transport, and a host of other areas. It also shares power with the Council (which represents the governments of the member states) producing the annual budget for the Union every year and has the power to block a budget and insist on it being redrafted.

Its approval is needed for international treaties as well as for enlargement of the Union.

It affects our lives in a number ways, some small, some large. For example, it imposed restrictions on the roaming charges people experience when making calls on their mobile phone from abroad. It placed strict controls on GMOs to ensure that every citizen would be aware of what produce was genetically modified and what wasn’t.

Citizens can also raise issues directly with the parliament through petitions, putting issues on the agenda of MEPs.

If the Lisbon Treaty is adopted in all 27 member states, parliament’s powers will increase further in a number of areas, making it all the more important for Ireland to have a strong voice in the next parliament.

3: Lisbon: Good for Europe. Vital for Ireland.

Fine Gael strongly supports the Lisbon Treaty. It contains some important and useful changes to the current Nice Treaty:
• The EU’s current voting system is based on a complicated mathematical formula that few understand or can justify. Lisbon replaces it with a more straight-forward two-tier system based half on population and half of equality between all sides. For many smaller countries that will increase their influence.
• The creation of a full-time chairperson for the European Council. With 27 members of the Union it is no longer feasible to stick with the system designed when there were just 9 members to have Council meetings chaired part-time by prime ministers, changing in rotation every six months.
• Merging the various competing positions that deal with foreign affairs into one full-time office-holder to increase efficiency and decrease bureaucracy.

4: Fine Gael’s vision of the European Union

Fine Gael believes in reform. Since January this year we have been producing a whole series of proposals to reform how the Irish state works. We want to see the Dáil and Seanad changed. We want the committee system reformed radically, and a major reduction in the number of junior ministers. In what we called ‘fair care’ we have proposed a revolutionary reform of our health service, to deliver European-standard heath care. (The details of ‘fair care’ can be found at http://www.faircare.ie/)

We do not stop however with reforms at home. We want to see the EU reformed also. We believe that the European Union also needs major reform to provide greater openness, transparency and accountability. Fine Gael believes that the EU has failed to communicate the truth about itself to the people, and also failed to understand people’s concerns.

Last November Fine Gael produced five specific proposals for change in Ireland’s relationship with the European Union.

Establishment of EU Citizens' Officer

Fine Gael proposes the establishment of a new constitutional office of European Union Citizens' Officer. The appointee would act as an independent advisory officer on all aspects of EU legislation, including its transposition into Irish law. He/she would work very closely with the European committees in the Oireachtas and have the power to make recommendations to the government on all aspects of EU lawmaking.

Irish citizens have seen how well the post of Comptroller and Auditor General has worked. We see the new EU Citizens’ Officer as a similar office, defending the public interest, offering objective advice, and providing impartial non-political information. The Office would also be responsible for promoting a greater focus on European issues in the education system.

Ratification of future treaties

There is no clarity as to what aspects of international treaties require constitutional approval. Fine Gael has proposed a constitutional change to allow future international treaties to be referred to the Supreme Court when they are agreed to establish which of their provisions require to be put to the people, and whether any of their contents would in any way conflict with the Irish constitution. Such a mechanism would ensure that we have greater clarity on the issues in future referendums.

Irish opt-out from judicial and home affairs cooperation

At the time the Lisbon Treaty was negotiated, the Government secured an opt-out from the parts of the treaty dealing with increased cooperation in the areas of judicial and home affairs. Fine Gael did not support this opt-out at the time as we believe that Ireland should be fully involved in the fight against international crime, especially as there is increasing evidence of this country being used as a route to import illegal drugs into Europe. The result of this new crime threat can be seen in the violent gangland conflicts in our major cities.

Fine Gael believes the Government should abandon this opt-out and any further referendum proposal should be based on Ireland fully participating in this important and valuable aspect of the Lisbon Treaty.

Strengthened Oireachtas’ role in European issues with reformed Seanad

A Review of Irish legislation to see how many Irish laws and statutory instruments originate in or from the European laws, suggests that the total is under 40%, far off the mythical 80% claimed by Eurosceptics. Many of these Acts cover areas that if we were not in the European Union we would be passing anyway from choice.

Fine Gael wants a reformed Seanad to deal with EU scrutiny

Implementation of existing EU law

Some people express fears that their lives have been negatively affected by the implementation of laws that come from Europe. This fear is played on by some Eurosceptics who spread myths about how 80% of Irish law comes from the EU.

Most EU directives are incorporated into Irish law through what are called ‘Statutory Instruments’. Between 1992 and 2009 in Ireland 588 Acts and 10,725 Statutory Instruments were passed. 114 Acts contain at least one reference to European legislation while 3,050 of the 10,725 Statutory Instruments contain at least one reference to European legislation. That means that of Irish legislation from 1992 to 2009, then, only 3,164 out of 11,313 Acts and Instruments contain any reference whatsoever to European legislation. The actual total is 27.97%, far off the mythical 80%.

People’s fears are built up not merely by false claims as to numbers, but also by the decisions they are led to believe they should blame the EU for. An example is the belief that it was because of the EU that water charges are to be imposed on schools from 2010, when in fact the reason is because the Government failed to negotiate a derogation.

There are justifiable fears that the EU is responsible for excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Good regulation is vital. Unnecessary regulation is pointless and a waste. There is also a sense that in some sectors there is a more stringent and vigorous approach to implementation in Ireland than in other member states.

Fine Gael will seek to have an independent audit commissioned into the transposition and implementation of EU law in Ireland. This audit, which will prioritise areas that have caused concern and controversy, will include

international comparative analysis so that it can be established if greater flexibility is being applied in other member states. Such an audit should invite submission from the public who feel aggrieved at the impact of the implementation of EU legislation on their lives or business activities.

Where there are problems, Fine Gael believes that they must be fixed and will work in the European Parliament to fix them. Where people’s genuine worries are groundless, the public have a right to know.

5: The European Economy – A vital role in recovery

Ireland’s economic growth in recent decades was in large measure because of our membership of the European Union. Membership of the Union gave us access to structural funds, agricultural supports, and a massive market, allowing more of our exports to go to EU states rather than primarily the United Kingdom.

Just as Europe played a crucial part in delivering economic growth, so Fine Gael believes it can play a crucial part in generating economic recovery. Alone and isolated, we would face an almost impossible task in dealing with the current economic crisis. But access to the EU, its funds and markets, opens up potential for a return to a thriving successful Ireland.

Our position would have been all the worse if we still had our own small currency. Being part of a stable powerful international currency protected us from currency speculators and ensured that our economic collapse did not become an economic catastrophe. Fine Gael believes strongly in our continuing membership of the Euro. Our participation in Economic and Monetary Union is, we believe, a vital component to our recovery.

But the benefits of EU and Euro membership is not enough. We can only achieve new success if we fix structural faults within our own economy, faults that the last twelve years of Fianna Fáil have allowed to grow and fester.

Fine Gael believes that costs in Ireland must be brought to a more manageable level. Proper regulation of the banking and other sectors of the economy must be introduced. The free-for-all agenda pushed by the current government gave us weak regulation that allowed for widespread abuses. That must never happen again.

Fine Gael in 2009 has announced detailed policies which when implemented by the party in government will help bring Ireland out of recession and into a new era of growth. In government, to boost the domestic economy, we will introduce 11 billion Euro in new investments in the period 2010-13 in key technologies and network infrastructures needed to reposition Ireland as the most competitive and sustainable economy in Europe within the next decade. This will be funded through a new state industrial holding company, the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA). NewERA investments will not count as Government expenditure, as they will be financial investments seeking a commercial rate of return, and repaid through charges on consumers and businesses for the use of new technologies and network infrastructures.

The investment programme will also help to drag Ireland’s economy out of recession by creating 100,000 extra jobs by 2013 in areas such as construction, maintenance, engineering, research, software, timber processing and forestry.

The combination of the radical investment programme we propose in Ireland through NewERA, with the positive benefits and access that flow from our role in the European Union, will help ensure Ireland’s return to economic growth in the future. Together they will offer the quickest and most effective way back to long-term recovery.

6: Consumer Protection

The European Union has been at the forefront of introducing consumer protection legislation.

However it is clear that over the years of the Celtic Tiger we have lived in rip-off Ireland. Consumers were overcharged and offered inadequate services, while the Government was slow to put in place sufficient protections against fraudulent or negligent suppliers of goods and services.

It is vital that Ireland learn from those mistakes and follow policies that place consumer protection at the heart of economic policy. Europe too can play its part in protecting the rights of consumers. Among changes needed are
• A high standard of common rules and practices in the area of consumer protection must exist across the EU;
• The distribution of accessible and relevant consumer information must be guaranteed to enable consumers to make informed choices;
• The basic consumer rights a consumer may need to call on if things go wrong, must be clear, fair and easy to understand. The same rights should apply across the Union.

With the growth in the number of cross-border consumer transactions, consumers need increased and easy access to EU systems of arbitration and mediation that will apply across the Union.

To achieve full impact, Fine Gael will tie in its policies on consumer protection in Europe to a series of consumer protection reforms it will introduce in government in Ireland. A key change will be the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority into a new, more powerful, and more consumer-orientated Office of Fair Trading that places consumer rights at the heart of economic and trading policy.

7: Promoting Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

Two-thirds of private-sector jobs in Europe are provided by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, while SMEs create the majority of new jobs. Their flexibility and dynamism make them a key factor in a country’s economy

being healthy. The EPP will do everything it can to encourage this spirit of entrepreneurship in order to create a more dynamic economy.

In that respect, youth and women entrepreneurship should be especially supported. Special attention has to be paid to the needs of start-up companies which should be relieved from excessive bureaucracy. In the context of the economic downturn, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable to the credit crunch due to their heavy dependence on bank credit, and limited access to financial markets.

It is the SMEs which need support measures in order to continue to be the main driving force for growth, job creation and innovation. Therefore they should be targeted by the EU and national financial stimulus packages.

8: Common European Defence and Security

Europe and the world in the last twenty years have undergone a fundamental change in relationships. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact have changed completely the context of Ireland’s neutrality. Today many of the threats faced by societies and states are not from each other but from armed groups and fundamentalist militants seeking to attack citizens.

Ireland’s traditional system of neutrality is designed for a world that is no longer, a world where wars were between countries or were a danger between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. In today’s world, security and defence involves dealing with terrorism and international fundamentalist movements. Ireland cannot stand still, applying a twentieth century form of neutrality in a twenty-first century world with twenty-first century problems. European countries are now designing a common EU security and defence system to face the new threats to world peace and international law, and our neutrality needs to evolve to take into account these changes.

We can of course opt out, and stay on the sidelines of discussions on designing a common European security and defence system. That is our right.

Fine Gael believes that that would be a tragic mistake. While we were neutral in the Cold War, we nevertheless were reliant for protection, in event of attack, on the security systems of the time, systems we had no chance of helping to shape.

We should seek from the start to influence the new European security system.

We want Ireland to get involved in the construction of such an agreement at an early stage so that we can join and influence it on our terms. Ireland should not only be part of the EU security and defence architecture, we should be one of the architects helping to design these systems to meet our needs, and our view of Europe’s needs.

Fine Gael, for example, wants any EU common security and defence system to be guided by five key principles:
1. The commitment to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations (UN);
2. The commitment to the pursuit of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, and a promise never to use either type of weapon;
3. The commitment to providing peacekeeping and peacemaking operations;
4. The commitment to respect the right of other EU States to enter other military alliances, or to be neutral, as they choose.
5. The right of Ireland to opt-in and opt-out of aspects of a mutual defence and security system on a case-by-case basis.

We cannot guarantee that those five principles will be enshrined in new security and defence systems unless we are at the negotiations insisting on them. If we believe in those fundamental principles, we should be willing stand up and fight for them in negotiations. We should not simply sit on the sidelines, powerless, and then complain when the principles we believe were not adopted as part of the EU defence and security system.

9: International peacekeeping

Ireland has a proud history in peace-keeping and peace-enforcing, most recently our mission in Chad. That role is changing however. In the twentieth century most peace-keeping missions were arranged directly by the United Nations. Underfunding and bureaucracy in the United Nations, and the end of the Cold War, has produced a new system of international peace-keeping. Under UN mandate, the UN asks regional security or political organisations such as the EU, the African Union, and NATO, to provide peace-keeping missions. The UN later on sometimes takes on the responsibility.

That is what happened with our mission in Chad. We served a year in a European Union force called EUFOR TCHAD/RCA. It is the peacekeeping system that the UN will be using in the future.

Ireland regulates our missions through what we call our ‘triple lock’. Every mission must have the approval of the Irish Government, Dáil Éireann, and the United Nations Security Council.

Fine Gael believes that system, through honourable, is flawed. The UN Security Council possesses five permanent security council members (the United States, China, France, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom) all of whom possess vetoes, meaning that many crucial peace-keeping missions can be blocked if any one of the five exercises their veto. The vetoes are used sometimes not because of humanitarian concerns but local politics. Ireland, by requiring a Security Council resolution, in effect allows its ability to take part in peace-keeping to be vetoed by any of the five permanent members for their own self-interest.

Fine Gael views this as unacceptable. We are allowing a design flaw in the UN to prevent us from talking part in humanitarian missions.

Fine Gael has proposed that the Triple Lock be modified so that instead of requiring a formal motion to be passed by the Security Council, all missions must be in keeping with the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Such a change would not by-pass the UN. It would ensure that our participation is based

on principles, not the internal political stances of the five permanent members. That, Fine Gael believes, would be fairer, more honest and more honourable.

Human rights, not international politics, should be the guiding principle of our role in peace-keeping.

10: Overseas Development Aid

Fine Gael has a strong commitment to see the developing world eradicate hunger and offer to its citizens a fair and just society. We supported the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals. We believe the European Union must focus its policies on the developing world on the goals, which aim to
• Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
• Achieve universal primary education
• Promote gender equality and empower women
• Reduce child mortality
• Improve maternal health
• Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases
• Ensure environmental sustainability
• Develop a global partnership for development

Fine Gael has repeatedly backed Ireland’s policy of using 0.7% of Gross National Product for Overseas Development Aid by 2012. Ireland has a long and proud history of involvement in the developing world. Our missionaries and third world agencies have been, and continue to be, crucial to championing the cause of the poor in the developing world. We believe it is right that we continue to be at the forefront of providing aid and leadership. As a former colony ourselves we are uniquely placed to understand the difficulties faced by many former colonies in Africa and offer aid, guidance and help.

Ireland today faces tough economic challenges, but so do our friends in the developing world. Therefore Fine Gael believes it is crucial that we do not abandon our commitments to the Developing World.

Fine Gael criticised the Government’s decision in the 2009 budget to reduce our ODA budget and called on the government to guarantee that whatever cuts they made this year will not lead to any delay in the achievement of the 0.7% target intended to be hit by 2012. The fact that our target is a percentage means that as Gross National Product (GNP) declines in the economic downturn, so will the amount of money that percentage refers to. So in straight money terms the amount the state is committed to deliver is already falling.

There is in our view no justification for reducing the percentage commitment when the amount of money committed is already falling as GNP falls. We share the concern of third world agencies that the 2012 target, which the government has already delayed once, may be missed a second time. That, we believe, would be unacceptable. The cuts are particularly regrettable given that Ireland has been successful in directing some of its development aid to the fight against HIV/AIDS. For that reason we believe that the government’s decision to cut Ireland’s overseas aid budget was wrong and will hurt the weakest in the developing world, and cost lives of many, particularly children.

11: Security, Crime and Terrorism in a Changing Europe

We live in difficult and dangerous times. Crime and terrorism offer a challenge to every country in the EU and every citizen. Fine Gael believes the government is not doing enough to protect our citizens. But there is also a lot the EU and its member states can and must do to protect us all.
• Fine Gael in the European Parliament will campaign to ensure maximum co-ordination exists across police forces and criminal justice systems.
• Fine Gael will work to ensure that no criminal can evade prosecution through fleeing between different jurisdictions. We believe there must be no safe havens for criminality in Europe.
• Fine Gael will support the Lisbon Treaty which provides for the creation of a European Public Prosecutor. The new post will only come into force when consented to by the European Parliament. We will work in Parliament to ensure the office when created is efficient, effective and powerful, while ensuring the necessary protections are in place to protect the innocent.
• Fine Gael wants to see the position of ‘Eurojust’, the EU’s Judicial Co-operation Unit, strengthened and made more efficient.
• Fine Gael believes strongly that laws against serious crimes such as trading in enslaved women, drug trafficking, internet-related crime, money laundering and acts of racism should be harmonised throughout the European Union in all national legal systems to establish comparable EU standards.

12: Migration into & within the European Union

Migration into and throughout the EU is a fact of modern European life. People move between states for work and personal reasons. For Europe, immigration is not merely a fact of life but a necessity. Demographically, the percentage of people of working age in the EU will be in decline in the next twenty years, meaning there will be a need for inward migration.

Ireland has received a far higher share of immigrants from countries that joined the EU in 2004 than any other EU state.

Some 5 per cent of the working-age population here originates in those countries, a report by the European Commission has found.

This is considerably more than in the UK, the second-largest receiving country in relative terms, where 1.2 per cent of the working-age population came from these 10 countries.

The task for Ireland and for the European Union is to create structures to enable society to cope with the changes that flow from migration, and ensure that there is fair treatment for all.

Migration was a factor which helped build the Celtic Tiger. The economic decline we are now facing means that immigration rates are dropping substantially, with many migrants into Ireland moving to other member states, or returning to their home country.

Fine Gael believes there must be action in dealing with the migration issue in a number of key areas:
• A co-ordinated proactive anti-discrimination campaign and blueprint for integration must be spearheaded at EU level in order to build on the experiences and good practice in other member states.
• Fine Gael wants to see an agreed mechanism for a standard entry format for third country migration into the Union.
• A much more effective and co-ordinated approach is needed at EU level of prevent human trafficking into and within the Union. Fine Gael has taken an active stand in the Dáil and Seanad on updating Irish laws on human trafficking, and will continue to do so at national and European Parliament level.
• Fine Gael believes the EU should expand and co-ordinate its actions to facilitate a common approach to asylum applications. We wish to see comprehensive EU-wide minimum standards of treatment for asylum applications.
• The right for EU citizens to travel within the union must be protected, but there is also a need to stamp out cross-border crime. This must involve greater co-operation and information sharing between police forces across the EU. The sharing of such information must become commonplace in order to improve border controls.
• A criminal database must be accessible across jurisdictions to ensure all necessary information is available in the policing of borders.
• There must be greater co-operation on third country deportations to facilitate the safe & cost effective return to the country of origin.

13: Enlarging the European Family

Fine Gael believes the project of European enlargement has benefited us all. When we joined the then European Economic Community (EEC) our community just consisted of nine members. Today it stands at 27, stretching from the Baltic or the Mediterranean, the Aran Islands to the Black Sea.

The Community as it originally created just consisted of a number of Western European states. Following the collapse of the Communist bloc the Union spread eastwards. Today there are European Union states all over the European continent, with the Union having a population of nearly 500 million.

Economic barriers have been removed, creating for the Union’s members one of the biggest markets in the world. At a time of economic slowdown worldwide, having a potential market of nearly 500 million people to export to will be crucial for Ireland and other places as we try to rebuild our economy.

Like any family, there are tensions and rivalries. But unlike the pre-EEC days, Europe’s tensions and rivalries are no longer expressed through wars. That is perhaps the lasting legacy of the European integration. That strength of community has arguably never been needed as much as it will be in the next year or two as the European family struggles to deal with the economic crisis that risks plunging much of the world into an economic depression. The interdependence between member states that is the hallmark of the European Union may well be the most important means at our disposal in enabling us all to get through the economic storm and get back to an era of growth.

14: A Healthy Europe

Fine Gael believes that prevention is better than cure and supports the EU principle that health-spending should be invested in preventive measures, to protect the general health of the population. Preventive medicine protects, promotes, and maintains health and well-being and takes steps to stop disease, disability, and premature death from occurring. Preventive medicine includes a range of interventions including childhood immunisation, health screening and early intervention, resulting in better outcomes for patients and a reduced burden on the health service.

One of the benefits of the EU is that it offers structures that can enable Europe-wide approaches to common health problems. Fine Gael believes that rather than wasting scare resources on duplicating expenditure on bureaucracies, consideration should be given to create a cross-country health budget in specific areas so that the member states could work together to combat illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, AIDS and cancer.

All these illnesses occur broadly to the same level in each state, so effective co-ordination of resources is much more likely to deliver benefits to everyone rather than each state on its own funding separate campaigns.

Fine Gael also believes that the European Union collectively should use its might to mobilise global action and resources for health research to halt the spread of diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS that increasingly threaten people all over the world. Properly resourced funding and international pressure from our Union could help save lives.

15: Disability

One of Europe’s most effective roles is in the communication of knowledge, of enabling policy makers in one state to learn from the experiences of others about how to deal with an issue.

While disability rights and concerns may be directly the responsibility of national government and local authorities, in terms of practical implementation of policies, as well as implementing the National Disability Strategy Ireland must learn from the experience of our European colleagues as to how to ensure the rights and needs of disabled citizens are fully and comprehensively provided for. Disability should not act as a barrier to someone achieving their potential. Whether in terms of European policy or national policy, Fine Gael believes that the rights and needs of disabled fellow citizens must be taken into account, and the best of international practice learnt from.

Fine Gael will use its position in the European Parliament to work with disability groups at home and abroad to see what additional insights can be learnt from international experience to ensure the position of Irish people with disabilities is protected and their rights vindicated.

16: Education

Access to education was crucial to the creation of the Celtic Tiger. But education is about more than improving economic performance. It can improve lives, giving greater options to people in careers, lifestyles, income, and personal fulfilment.

Fine Gael is highly critical of recent government decisions on education, believing that they will hinder, not help, the prospect of economic recovery.

We also believe that the European Union can play a crucial role in developing the standard of education across all 27 member states.

Fine Gael believes that
• An education system of the highest quality must be available to all citizens providing for greater choice and encouraging wider participation;
• Multilingualism must be a goal across Europe. It is important in the twenty-first century that as many people as possible in our Union should be fluent in Europe’s languages. Our educational system must reflect this commitment to multiculturalism.
• We believe strongly that the promotion of new technologies in training and education programmes should be supported;
• Obstacles to student and teaching mobility must be removed.
• Participation in the Bologna Process at a European level is essential to encouraging modernisation of the third level sector, greater levels of quality across the EU, while at the same time favouring academic freedom. To further Ireland’s participation in this process Fine Gael has outlined a programme of third level reform aimed at improving quality assurance procedures and enhancing the quality of third level education domestically.
• Ireland’s domestic education policy and systems must be developed to reflect the highest standards at an EU level to enhance competitiveness encourage mobility and ensure educational outcomes here favour comparably with our EU counterparts.

Fine Gael has outlined its own detailed policy proposals for Third Level education in its recently launched ‘The Third Way: A Fine Gael Green Paper on reform of Higher Education’, published in March 2009. Fine Gael believes that education at all levels is vital for the future development of Ireland, and will give it priority attention in government. Ireland’s Celtic Tiger years were built on the investment in education in the 1960s. We will insure, at both European and national level, that education remains a key focus.

17: Children – their safety must be our priority

Fine Gael believes Ireland’s protection levels for children are inadequate. Children as the most vulnerable members of society must receive full and adequate protection. We want far stronger vetting procedures applied to people who, through employment or volunteer positions, have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.

In the Dáil and in Oireachtas committees Fine Gael has led the debate on strengthening vetting procedures. We will not allow risks to be taken with the safety of our children. That is why we believe a constitutional referendum should be held to remove the defence of “mistake as to age” in cases where an adult is accused of having sex with an underage child, and ensure there is an absolute zone of protection for all children under 15 years of age. We also believe that the age of consent should remain at 17.

Fine Gael also believes that the European Union should take an active role in the promotion of basic vetting standards, creating where possible a uniform system that protects all children of all nations equally. What we fear is that those who prey on children may focus their attention on the country or countries with the weakest vetting system, knowing that there they may escape detection in a way that would not be possible anywhere else. That is a risk we are not prepared to take and we will campaign vigorously on the issue, whether in the Dáil and Seanad or in the European Parliament.

18: Agriculture

Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been crucial to the success of Ireland’s membership of the EEC and EU. The CAP however does not stand still, and further reform of it will emerge post 2013.

It is crucial, therefore, that Ireland has a strong and powerful voice in the European parliament to defend Ireland’s interests in any reform of CAP. We must not sacrifice Irish agriculture in any deal, and Fine Gael will be a strong campaigner and voice for Irish agriculture in Brussels and Strasburg.

Fine Gael believes that agricultural policy must defend the family farm structure in Ireland. The EU must support sustainable agricultural production by providing product-price stability and income stability to farming families. The EU market is vital for our agricultural exports and Fine Gael will work to ensure that Irish agriculture is focused on supplying, and is promoted in, the EU market.

Irish agriculture will face major challenges in the coming years, challenges made more difficult by the economic downturn.

The Review of the EU budget will focus on agriculture. Fine Gael will insist that Europe develops an agriculture policy first and then seek the resources to implement the policy at EU level rather than merely cutting policy to fit a budget. We must defend our share of the agricultural budget in post 2013 era.

Fine Gael recognises the importance of the live animal export trade to our agricultural sector and the challenges posed by emerging bio-security issues in recent years. We are committed to ensuring that any policies or regulatory measures developed at a European or domestic level ensure sustainability of the sector.

Fine Gael believes strongly in the need to improve our water quality and encourage farm practices that ensure high environmental standards. We also recognise the needs of Irish farmers, and believe that a fair balance can be struck that will not unfairly burden Irish agriculture. We believe that the Nitrates Directive, as with much of EU agricultural policy, has two fundamental flaws

(i) It is too bureaucratic, involving the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local authorities, wasting too much money on needless duplication.

(ii) It takes no account of the reality of agriculture and policies such as ‘farming-by-dates’, because of the nature of agriculture, are unworkable. We will insist that Ireland’s implementation of the Directive is reformed to provide for the sort of flexibility that is needed on a family farm.

Fine Gael is committed to a simpler approach to effective compliance with EU Regulations and Directives and will carry out a review of domestic implementation of EU legislation to reduce levels of red tape and paperwork for farmers.

Fine Gael will thoroughly examine all necessary regulations to ensure farmers can enter into farm partnerships if they so desire to improve efficiency without suffering any penalties.

Fine Gael will review the myriad of agencies involved in food monitoring and traceability systems domestically with a view to introducing a more transparent, effective system of food safety from farm to fork and enhancing our competitiveness and reputation on the global market.

We will work to see particular emphasis placed in effective marketing of Irish farm produce, to ensure high quality agri-food products receive premium prices on the European market.

Fine Gael is committed to REPS and believes that it must be structured to ensure the maximum number of farmers participate in the scheme by ensuring ease of entry through a minimum amount of paperwork and bureaucracy.

Fine Gael fully recognises the importance of passing on farms to the next generation. The family farm remains at the heart of rural Ireland and must be defended. In particular we believe that the European Union in its policies must work to encourage young people to remain in farming, and encourage young farmer installation.

Fine Gael believes that in all future World Trade Talks, ""equivalence"" should inform any E.U. approach to WTO negotiations. In other words, the same set of standards relating to animal welfare, environmental standards of production, the use of veterinary medicines, etc must be applied when allowing goods to be sold in the European market. Europe’s shoppers should be able to know that all foodstuffs available on the shelves are safe and ethically produced. Europe should require producers in other continents to achieve the same high standards of control, production and safety with their products as are required of European producers, as a condition for access to markets in Europe.

19: Protecting the Environment

Pollution does not respect national boundaries, making it a natural area for co-ordinated EU action. Environmental damage in one state directly or indirectly affects other states. That is why Fine Gael believes the Union must take an active role in legislating for a cleaner environment.

The Celtic Tiger years have seen a deterioration in our natural environment, as rapid development placed little emphasis on occasions on good planning. We believe that the mistakes of the past must be learned and the level of environmental deterioration witnessed in recent years must be challenged.

Fine Gael believes that major emphasis must be placed in terms of waste management on the prevention and minimisation of waste and the provision of recycling facilities.

Fine Gael remains very concerned at the failure of the government to prioritise environmental matters, and to implement EU directives without delay.

20: Climate Change

In Europe, nearly all regions will be negatively affected by some future impacts of climate change, posing difficult challenges to many economic sectors. Negative impacts will include:
• increased risk of inland flash floods
• more frequent coastal flooding
• increased erosion (due to storms and the rise in sea levels)
• increased risk of forest fires (due to heat waves)
• water scarcity and droughts.

Ireland would not escape these.

Climate is one of the many issues where a co-ordinated approach from across the EU is vital. Europe set clear reduction targets in March 2007 and has shown a willingness to work with international bodies to make a meaningful contribution to dealing with the crisis. No other region in the world is better suited to provide global leadership on this issue and to stimulate others by its own actions than the European Union.

Ireland’s record under a succession of Fianna Fáil-led governments has been a catalogue of mistakes, misjudgements and missed opportunities. Their errors have left Ireland’s carbon emissions so far off target that the only way Ireland can reach its 2012 carbon emissions targets is by purchasing carbon credits from other states. It is a “short-sighted, short term 'sticking plaster' solution to a gravely serious problem”, in the words of Trevor Sargent of the Green Party in 2007, a viewpoint Fine Gael shares.

Unlike this government, Fine Gael has produced a detailed and radical policy programme called ‘Rebuilding Ireland’, containing a visionary 11 billion Euros investment programme which will see significant State intervention to rapidly promote more sustainable energy and transport sectors while bringing telecommunications into the 21st Century. Our plan, launched last March, will not merely change the country’s direction and invest in the green economy, but will create 100,000 jobs as we turn Ireland into a low carbon economy.

The ability of Europe to take a set of Europe-wide policy initiatives on an issue as sensitive and vital as climate change shows the importance of the EU is helping shape all our futures. Fine Gael is committed in the EPP and in the European Parliament to help in its policies to counteract climate change.

Fine Gael and the EPP want the European Union to be the frontrunner in low-carbon and carbon-free technologies and will work to achieve that in Dáil Éireann, in the European Parliament, and when we are in government.

21: Renewable Energy

Fine Gael believes that Ireland’s performance in the area of renewable energy promotion is neither adequate nor acceptable. We believe the failure of the government to develop adequately all renewable energy options is regrettable and must be reversed.

As a matter or urgency we must create a viable market place for renewable energy. Fine Gael believes that this can be achieved by a number of important actions:
• Wind energy must be prioritised;
• Wood biomass can be used in addition to peat as a fuel source;
• Cutbacks in the forestry sector must be reversed and a new emphasis on planting initiated;
• Tax incentives for non-renewable imported energy sources should be reduced to rebalance the economy in order to encourage the grow of biofuels on Irish farms;
• As an island nation, Ireland must become a leader in research on wave and tidal energy;
• All local authorities must be directed to create renewable energy plans;

In government, based on our Rebuilding Ireland: a “NewERA” for the Irish Economy policy document launched earlier this year, among the national reforms we will be introducing are a new semi-state company, “Renewable Energy Ireland”, which will invest in early stage green energy companies and applied renewable energy research, with a particular focus on technologies that can be licensed. It will invest 100 million Euros over the period 2010-2013. Renewable Energy Ireland will have two main priorities: (1) To ensure that Ireland fully exploits its favourable ocean energy resources; and (2) To build up Ireland’s commercial position in markets which have huge growth potential but where we currently are under-represented, e.g. wind technology.

Taken together, our national and European policies will form a frame-work for the development of Renewable Energy in Ireland.

22: Marine

Fine Gael believes that it is important that Ireland is represented strongly in future negotiations of the Common Fisheries Policy. Fine Gael is committed to the future of Irish fisheries and believes the strength of the industry is dependent on strong negotiation and adequate support at an EU level coupled with a firm conviction to reform the sector domestically as recommended by the Cawley Strategy.

We believe that the policing of the CFP has been unbalanced, with Ireland’s fishermen often facing more extreme regulation than those in fishing fleets from other jurisdictions.

Fine Gael believes that it is important that Ireland is represented strongly in future re-negotiations of the Common Fisheries Policy. We believe that the policing of the CFP has been haphazard and unbalanced, with Ireland’s fishermen often facing more extreme regulation than those in fishing fleets from other jurisdictions.

We believe a correct balance must be struck. Fine Gael recently published a Fisheries Bill to reform Ireland’s fisheries law to provide a fairer legal framework than exists at present, one which reflects the norm in fisheries law in the recent of the European Union.

Two of the major problems currently facing the European Union are smuggling and the threat of terrorism. Countries such as Ireland, with large coasts, face considerable difficulty and costs in patrolling our coastline. In recent years Gardaí and the Irish coast guard have prevented the importation of over 1 billion Euros worth of cocaine, in a number of large seizures. Given that Ireland is often targeted by smugglers because of our membership of the EU, Fine Gael believes the EU should create an EU coastguard, to augment and back up national coastguard services.

Such an EU coastguard would help Ireland and other states in the battle against smugglers, while offering a crucial protection against the threat of terrorism. It is an issue which Fine Gael MEPs will continue to raise within the European Parliament and elsewhere.

23: Tourism

Tourism has in recent years been a crucial feature of Ireland’s economic development. Its multi-billion euro contribution to exchequer funding, and the impact of the tourist industry on jobs and Ireland’s Gross National Product, highlights how crucial the industry is, particularly during an economic downturn.

Fine Gael believes that the current government’s failure to control rising costs, and the growing lack of competitiveness within the Irish economy, has endangered the future growth of this crucial national industry. Fine Gael suggests a full analysis of all structural costs within the industry is urgently required with a view to ensuring maximum competitiveness, so as to ensure maximum long-term benefit both in terms of job creation and contributions to the exchequer.

Tourism possesses particular potential within the European Union. Within the EU tourism accounts for 5% of employment and has a significant impact across all sectors of the European economy and society.

Fine Gael believes that EU funding for tourism, to maximise its impact on the greater European economy, is critical. It is also critical that such funds focus particularly on enabling greater access to the regions, and in redressing imbalances in tourism growth where they arise.

Ireland, as an island nation on the periphery of the European landmass, faces particular problems with regard to access. Fine Gael believes obstacles to tourism such the Departure Levy should be removed and opportunities such as the introduction of the first pre-clearance facility for the United States in Shannon, should be maximised to capture potential tourist traffic through Ireland from the EU en route to the United States.

24: Regional Development

Fine Gael is committed to ensuring maximum status for the Border-Midlands-West (BMW) region in all allocations of EU cohesion funds and that the status is reflective of the economic decline that had followed recent economic events, rather than based on earlier economic levels achieved during the Celtic Tiger.

Fine Gael will work to ensure that EU policies in central areas such as Industrial Development, Trade and Enterprise are not at divergence with EU regional development policies. To ensure balanced regional development their needs must be factored in during the formation of new policies for the EU.

Fine Gael believes strongly that EU Regional Development policies, should aim not only to address economic and social imbalances between the regions, but must also seek to enhance equal opportunities irrespective of gender, age or disability within the regions.

Fine Gael is committed to using available funds under the EU Rural Development Programme appropriately and effectively to ensure long term employment, sustainable enterprise creation and viable rural communities are created through the best possible use of EU funds.

"EP 2009: Green Party","Introduction

The Green Party continues its commitment to the development of the European Union along democratic, sustainable lines with a commitment to social justice and peace. While this economic crisis will strain the capacities of governments and the EU, it has the potential to usher in a new era of green economics that provides stable jobs in a sustainable economy.

Future generations will not thank us if we simply patch up our economy and continue along the same destructive path, repeating the mistakes of credit bubbles and unsustainable resource depletion. We have a short term necessity, and a long term moral obligation, to respond to this crisis by adopting new and innovative policy proposals.

“Future generations will not thank us if we simply patch up our economy and continue along the same path.” 

Of all the political parties, only the Green Party stands ready with bold ideas for this new era – ideas to repair our damaged economies, to renew government and to combat problems such as climate change and mass poverty in the developing world.

The Green Party also recognises that Ireland cannot act alone – both the financial and environmental crises have an international dimension and as such can only be resolved working within the EU.

This manifesto outlines what measures Irish Green MEPs would adopt to resolve the financial crisis, protect our environment and ensure a more democratic and accountable Union.

Making europe more democratic

The EU’s ability to respond to the environmental and economic crises has been hampered by the limitations of its democratic legitimacy. It needs to adopt urgently measures that will make its operations more transparent and accessible, with citizens having an easy understanding of what their rights and entitlements are.

Such transparency must exist throughout EU institutions and bodies, with the European Parliament leading the way. This can be done through reducing graft and abuse of MEPs’ expenses, including full disclosure of their accounts.

Another example of waste is the splitting of its meetings and administration between three locations – Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg. This costs taxpayers €200m per annum and emits a total of 20,000 tones of carbon dioxide emissions in transportation. This must be corrected by giving the Parliament a single seat of assembly and administration.

The Parliament remains the most democratic EU institution and as such an attempt to resolve the Union’s democratic deficit must involve increasing the role and responsibility of the Parliament.

To achieve this Green MEPs would fight for the following:
• Right of legislative initiative: At present, the Parliament may only suggest to the European Commission that it should propose certain legislation. Irish Green MEPs would seek to amend the treaties so that both the Parliament and the Commission have the right to initiate legislation.
• Oversight of agencies: The number of EU agencies has expanded enormously since they were first introduced in 1994. While they conduct vital work, it is important that they are accountable to the EP. Irish Green MEPs would hold them accountable to the Parliament.
• International trade agreements: such agreements will, despite the current economic crisis, remain crucial to the global economies. For these to have legitimacy, the Parliament must be given a say in their drafting from start to finish, including full power to approve or reject them.
• Relationship with the Commission: Irish Green MEPs will actively work to hold the Commission to account in both committee and plenary sessions of the EP.

One of the most insidious aspects of the legislative process is the dominance of lobbyists, of which there are an estimated 15,000 in Brussels, most of whom represent business interests.

Irish Green MEPs would work for stricter regulation of lobbyists, including the establishment of a compulsory register of all lobbying groups, stricter rules to prevent EU officials leaving their jobs and immediately going to work for the business interests they have been dealing with and greater transparency in the Commission’s dealings with lobbyists.

Opt outs, while important in protecting the sovereignty of member states, should also be recognised as creating an overly complex and disjointed EU. Irish Green MEPs would therefore work with the UK to end our opt out from the Schengen zone either by entering together, or by establishing a system whereby Ireland could enter alone.

climate change, transport and energy policy

A Green New Deal for Ireland

Combating climate change can be the solution to our economic crisis. By focusing on green technology, governments can both tackle climate change and help Ireland develop a sustainable economy. By investing in insulation, renewable energy and public transport infrastructure we can create thousands of jobs and, through creating new technology, return Ireland to a nation of exporters.

Ireland is uniquely placed to benefit from this Green New Deal – because of its young, educated workforce; energy and environment ministers committed to expanding significantly Ireland’s green infrastructure and its untapped alternative energy potential.

The first aspect of this Green New Deal will be political – ensuring that the EU remains committed to its energy/carbon targets such as ‘20/20/20’ (20% reduction in carbon emissions, 20% improvement in energy efficiency and 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020’). Irish Green MEPs will pursue a binding target of a 90% reduction in 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by 2050.

The second aspect of this Green New Deal will ensure that sufficient capital is directed towards the green sector. To this end, Irish Green MEPs will ensure that the European Investment Bank and other financial institutions have a strengthened role so that it can contribute capital to these objectives.

The third aspect of this Green New Deal is ensuring that the pan-European infrastructure exists to enable a green energy revolution – largely, this would consist of building a ‘supergrid’ across the continent so that “Ireland is uniquely placed to benefit from this Green New Deal – because of its workforce; committed ministers; and its untapped alternative energy potential.”

renewable energy such as wind from Ireland can be sold across Europe. Work on such a project is underway, but Irish Green MEPs will ensure it is expanded and expedited.

The fourth aspect is ensuring that EU policy is sufficiently orientated towards the green economy. A priority for Irish Green MEPs will be to establish an energy hierarchy similar to the waste hierarchy that exists, with the preferred energy options being those ranked lowest in terms of their carbon emissions and levels of pollution, including toxic pollution, to guide EU energy policy.

Irish Green MEPs will also push to establish a European community for renewables modeled on Euratom which would coordinate the development of renewable energy in Europe.

The fifth and final aspect is in the international sphere using the authority of the EU to ensure that the strongest possible treaties are agreed in international negotiations on climate change.

If implemented, the above actions have the potential to radically alter Europe’s energy consumption; minimise climate change and develop a highly dependable and sustainable green economy which will provide millions of jobs across Europe.

Nuclear energy cannot be part of the solution to climate change. Expensive investments in this dead-end technology will be unable to contribute to the urgently-needed emissions reductions and will divert much-needed funds from the promotion of sustainable energy production.

Transport

Recent policy positions from the Commission indicate a growing preference towards public transport and rail freight. However, there remains a severe bias in transport policy across the EU over recent decades and it will be difficult to undo the legacy of this. In the late 20th Century an average of 600km of railway disappeared each year across the EU, replaced with an average of 1200 new kilometres of motorway.

This bias means Ireland is not unique in witnessing an explosion in car usage – between 1970 and 2003, EU car usage increased 2.5 times.

As oil supplies decline, we potentially stand at the cusp of a major investment in rail and other public transport methods which will make a significant contribution to reducing our CO2  emissions, as well as providing employment during these difficult economic times.

To that end, Irish Green MEPs will adopt the following measures:
• Ensure that walking and cycling are mandated as the primary modes of transport in all future EU policy documents. This prioritising of the least energy-intensive – and healthiest – modes of transport must find its way to the heart of policy making in all member states.
• Extend the remit of the European Rail Agency. While its current remit is centred on safety, there is scope to expand its work so that it actively assists member states to boost rail freight, make maximum use of existing lines and reopen closed lines.
• Radically reduce the bias in regional funding towards road networks and ensure member states’ phase out subsidies of internal airlines.
• Irish Green MEPs will insist on making air travel as efficient as possible. To this end, our MEPs will support the implementation of a single, Europe-wide air traffic control system which will better coordinate flights and so reduce C0 2 emissions. Irish Green MEPs will work to have a North Atlantic European air traffic system based in Ireland, securing hundreds of highly skilled jobs.
• Legislate to ensure that ferries should connect to an on-shore supply of renewable energy while in port rather than using their huge diesel engines. Sweden has already introduced such measures at its ports.
• Further advance the preference for public transport and other carbon friendly transport methods in EU transport strategies. The EU must play a key role in ensuring that a coherent, reliable transport system develops on a pan-European basis.

Cap and share

Cap and Share is a new system which involves ‘capping’ and progressively reducing carbon emissions, and then distributing that total equally among the population. There is a growing recognition that the introduction of such a system is the most viable and equitable way of reducing carbon emissions.

Like all measures to combat climate change, there must be an element of urgency to this project and so our MEPs will aim to have a framework for such a system in place by the end of their first term in the Parliament. One proposed system is ‘environmental credits’, a system similar to distributing tax credits.

“With declining oil supplies, investment in public transport will make a significant contribution to reducing CO 2 emissions, as well as providing employment.”

Social and workers’ rights and equality

A Europe of rights

The Green Party opposes recent European Court of Justice rulings that have delivered a neoliberal slant to workers’ rights in the Union. Irish Green MEPs will make these workers’ rights a priority. In particular, they will push for the following measures:
• Amending the Posted Workers directive to deal with social dumping as illustrated in ECJ judgments, which allows companies to bring in workers from other Member States on a temporary basis and which results in wage levels in the host state being undermined.
• Supporting the Agency Workers Directive. Agency workers are those who work for employment agencies and have some of the lowest employment rights in the workforce. An Agency Workers Directive will clearly outline the rights available to them.
• Seeking to better resource the European Court of Justice so as to expedite cases. There is currently a two year back log of cases, which undermines the Court’s ability to enforce EU legislation in this area.
• Ensuring that the EU remains committed to equal pay for equal work. At present, women still earn, on average, 16% less than men.

The Green Party also stands opposed to any measures which will worsen the position of those most vulnerable in our society such as the less abled, single parent families and the longterm unemployed.

Principal to protecting these rights is the defence of the public sector, which provides vital services to all in the EU but especially to those most vulnerable. Irish Green MEPs will therefore push for legislation that defines Services of General Economic Interest and outlines how these are to be defended.

Protection of health services will be a crucial priority for Irish Green MEPs. While the above Directive on General Economic Interests will offer broad protection for member states’ health services, it is equally important to combat the pervasive influence of medical lobbyists and the pharmaceutical companies. For example, advertising or promoting prescription drugs to the public is about profit for pharmaceutical companies and not about public health.

Irish Green MEPs will oppose Commission proposals that may directly permit or may lead to excessive advertising of consumer medicines to the public.

“Irish Green MEPs will use their position to ensure minority rights are advanced.”

Ending discrimination

Irish Green MEPs will use their position to ensure minority rights are advanced. The EU must continue to combat racism and xenophobia, in all its forms.

Appropriately managed immigration is an opportunity, not a threat. We need positiveminded policies that will allow people, especially the skilled workers needed in certain areas, to come here legally and efficiently. Immigrants who work in the EU deserve equal rights and equal pay, as well as the opportunity to obtain European citizenship and the right to participate in the political process.

Greater EU action is needed to end discrimination based on sexual orientation, such as extending recognition across states of same-sex partnerships and extending family definitions in the EU beyond the traditional nuclear family.

Irish Green MEPs will work towards a Europe-wide directive on independent living, ensuring that people with disabilities in all EU member states
1. are supported with services and opportunities
2. have choice and control in their lives to enable them to access education, employment, services and community life equal to non disabled people.
3. are able to move throughout member states as is the right of all EU citizens, with support services to enable this. 

Ensuring a sustainable recovery

The financial crisis of the past year was the result of decades of neo-liberal policies that deregulated markets, led to increased global interdependency and encouraged excessive risk taking without the necessary safeguards. Irish Green MEPs will ensure that we never return to such a destructive system.

At a European level our priorities will be developing an independent financial regulator, with real powers capable of ensuring the mistakes of the past few decades are not repeated. The role of the European Central Bank must be examined. Currently its remit is to ensure a low level of inflation. Added to this should be the achievement of full employment through the pursuit of sustainable economy.

On a global level Irish Green MEPs will work to introduce a financial transaction levy (also known as a ‘Tobin Tax’), which would reduce speculation and fund a war chest to combat poverty and provide security against future economic uncertainty.

International institutions such as the IMF are in need of urgent reform so that they are capable of regulating international transactions and ensuring the mistakes of the past decades are avoided.

damages public health, which in turn places a strain on societies and economies. The EU needs to do more to address the threats to public health, whether water or air borne, noise, toxic substances, or through the spread of diseases.

One potential way of advancing environmental quality in Europe is through a ‘green cities initiative’. Many cities are experimenting with different initiatives to improve environmental quality and quality of life in previously decayed urban areas. Irish Green MEPs would make cities like Cork, Belfast and Dublin innovators in this area.

As well as securing EU funding for such projects, our MEPs would work to ensure knowledge and policy suggestions on this topic are shared between different urban areas in the Union. Establishing an EU version of the ‘United States Conference of Mayors’ would be a good start to such a project.

Resources, agriculture and the environment

Safegaurding our environment

Environmental responsibility does not stop at ensuring we combat climate change. Environmental responsibility must also be concerned with the safety of the air we breathe, the water we use and the food we eat. Environmental pollution

Greening our cities would in particular involve reconnecting urban dwellers to food and agriculture – people must have an appreciation of how the food chain operates. Access to allotments is a right for all citizens, and Irish Green MEPs would ensure that EU cities provide them for their inhabitants.

Biodiversity is severely under threat worldwide, with a species extinction rate that is 1,00010,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate. The

EU agreed to halt biodiversity loss within the EU by 2010.

Irish Green MEPs would seek to back this proposal and extend it by setting new targets for the increase in land area under conservation protection and making the protection of biodiversity central to all future policy decisions and documents. The protection of biodiversity can have positive economic benefits such as in the continued growth in nature based tourism and food production, which means protection of biodiversity is central to our economic recovery.

While there are 23 official EU languages, there are over 60 indigenous regional or minority language communities. In an ever expanding Union, extra effort needs to be made to preserve this cultural diversity. Irish Green MEPs will work to protect vulnerable minority languages as well as promote intercultural communication through supporting Esperanto.

Agriculture and fisheries

A secure farming future for Ireland is vital for our economy and society. Irish Green MEPs will be at the forefront of reforms that will both strengthen the economic future of farming and minimise its impact on Ireland’s environment.

Central to this objective is developing a model of agriculture and food production that is advantageous to small producers, respectful of the local environment and that secures a sustainable future for farming. Ireland is already well positioned for such a development, with Food Minister Trevor Sargent setting ambitious targets for organic production and supporting the development of farmers’ markets.

Irish Green MEPs would ensure that EU policy is positioned to support such a model of agriculture. This can be done by directing subsidies more towards local producers, passing legislation that favours the transportation of food over shorter distances and increasing the level of organic farming in the EU from 4% in 2006 to 10% by 2014.

Crucial to a sustainable agriculture industry is a ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), Irish Green MEPs will work to make the European Union a GMO free zone. Farming policies should promote sufficiency on a local level, which reduces unnecessary transport. Animals must be treated ethically – in agriculture, as in all other contexts.

Such an approach would advance Ireland’s position as a leading exporter in high quality food, securing thousands of jobs in rural Ireland.

The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been an exercise in self-destruction, driving many fish stocks to precarious levels. It needs to be urgently reformed away from the current model of waste and exploitation so as to allow fishermen to responsibly manage fisheries and fish stocks.

Human rights, defence and foreign affairs europe in the wider world

International institutions

The economic and environmental crises have placed us in an era of unprecedented change. They have proven to us that old global institutions have failed – failed to provide stability, failed to respond to global challenges such as poverty and conflict, and failed to secure the planet for future generations.

The world has changed radically since the membership of the UN Security Council was decided at the end of the Second World War – victory in 20th century conflicts is insufficient grounds for such dominance in the 21st century. Irish Green MEPs would seek a greater role for developing nations in the Security Council.

For too long, the priority of the WTO has been the free movement of goods and services regardless of the consequences. The past 12 months have shown that reckless disregard for consequences can only continue for so long – the WTO must be reformed to end the control wielded by developed countries. Its priority must shift from free trade to fair trade, trade that helps local communities develop not suffer and trade that takes into account its overall impact on the planet.

Peacekeeping

The European Union must play a more active role in civil and non-violent conflict resolution, peacekeeping operations and disarmament beyond its borders. The EU must champion peace in other regions of the continent, such as the Western Balkans and the Caucasus, and throughout the world.

Ireland’s position as a ‘neutral state’ should be recognised by having a greater emphasis on Ireland’s diplomatic capabilities, rather than its military capabilities, in international conflicts.

By drawing on experience gained in Northern Ireland, Ireland can make a unique and valued contribution to international peacemaking via non-military means.

International cooperation and humanitarian aid must be prioritised. Establishing a European Civil Peace Corps ready to make non-military interventions for humanitarian purposes would play an important part in this.

The Greens have delivered in Europe – from protecting the rural environment to expanding democratic accountability, from ensuring a more social Europe to ensuring Europe plays a peaceful role in the world.

By voting for Irish Green Party candidates in this year’s European elections, you will be supporting an ambitious but vital programme of green investment that will combat climate change, reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels and create a just and sustainable economy and society for us all.

"EP 2009: Labour","FOREWORD

These are the most important European elections Ireland has ever had.

Europe is facing its worst economic crisis since the 1930s. More than 19 million Europeans are now unemployed, and the number is rising. In February 2009 alone, half a million Europeans lost their jobs. This crisis has created clear political dividing lines in Europe.

Between those whose instinct is to do everything possible to save jobs, and those who are obsessed with accounting exercises.

Between those who want to regulate financial markets to make sure this never happens again, and those who want to get back to business as usual.

Between those who want a social Europe, and those who want to erode rights and living standards. Labour, together with our sister parties in the Party of European Socialists (PES), is campaigning on a platform that is about jobs and fairness. Even before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the PES was to the forefront in advancing proposals for better regulation of global finance. The number one priority for the European Labour movement in these elections is to safeguard jobs, create new ones, and promote smart, environmentally friendly growth.

Ireland’s future depends crucially on what happens in Europe. For all that our economic problems have been caused by Fianna Fáil’s misgovernment, getting out of the economic crisis will depend too on what happens in Europe. Growth in Europe will help to drive growth and jobs in Ireland. And European action can assist Irish people to get back to work as quickly as possible.

This is a global crisis in global capitalism. It demands a response at European level, where countries can come together, because this crisis will not be solved by any one country acting alone.

A strong progressive voice in the European parliament is vital.A strong PES will campaign in Europe for greater levels of European investment, a more co-ordinated European approach to the crisis, and direct European action to assist in re-training and skills initiatives.

Please give your No. 1 Vote to Labour’s candidates on 5th June.

WHY DOES IT MATTER WHO WE ELECT TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT?

It matters a lot. As the credit crunch has shown, we live in a joined up world, where the problems that face us have to be dealt with in a joined-up way. Working through the European Union, we can tackle the big issues that face our country, in a way that we simply cannot do acting alone.

But it won’t happen by accident. If we want the European Union to deal with the issues that affect our lives, then we must send people to European Parliament who will make those issues a priority. The European Parliament will appoint the new Commission President and the entire Commission in November. Our elected representatives in the European Parliament play a vital role in setting the priorities of the EU. The conservative, right-wing parties in Europe will work to ensure greater deregulation and more of the neo-liberal policies that created the global crisis. Labour in Europe, acting with our sister parties in the PES, will work to deal with the issues that affect all of us in our daily lives, and that will affect the lives of our children and grandchildren.

This manifesto sets out the priorities that will drive Labour in Europe for the next five years, including:

Tackling the Jobs Crisis and Reforming Financial Markets

Building a Social Europe

Transforming Europe into the leading global force against climate change

Promoting equality and justice in Europe

Enhancing Europe’s role as a partner for peace, security and development.

Labour wants a progressive Europe, working in the interests of the people of Europe. We will rigorously pursue that objective in the European Parliament, and our vote to ratify the next European Commission will depend on whether they are also committed to pursing that objective.

1. TACKLING THE JOBS CRISIS

The number one priority for Labour in Europe is to safeguard jobs, create new ones, and promote smart, environmentally sustainable growth.

Europe is facing its worst economic crisis since the 1930s. The scale of the challenge is so great, that Europe must act together to overcome it. The more quickly Europe’s economy recovers, the more quickly Ireland can begin to recover from the economic chaos created by Fianna Fáil.

Already, the euro has played a key role in protecting European economies in the middle of the global financial crisis. But more must be done now to simultaneously reform financial markets, counteract the recession and relaunch the economy to create new growth and jobs.

Fighting climate change is a key part of our economic strategy. The threat of catastrophic climate change is growing: if we do not act now, it will further damage the planet and directly affect our lives. At the same time, fighting climate change can transform the European economy and create new smart, environmentally sustainable growth, jobs and prosperity for everyone in Europe.

This smart, eco-growth will be much easier to achieve if we work together.

In Ireland, and across Europe, how people get through the crisis, and the speed of our recovery, will depend on skills. It is imperative that our citizens – of all ages – have the opportunity to develop their skills, to help them find new and better jobs, as well as being able to work and study abroad. Equally, the speed at which new jobs can be created in new sectors depends on people having the necessary skills.We believe European policy can support action at local and national level to enhance educational and re-skilling opportunities.

Our economies are more interdependent than ever. Only a stronger, bolder and better coordinated European and global recovery effort will lift us out of recession. By acting together in Europe and worldwide, we can forge a stronger path to recovery. By choosing the right priorities for action, we can help engineer a recovery that would benefit everyone. We should also treat this crisis as an opportunity to bring lasting transformational change for a fair society. Therefore, we call for a strengthened European Economic Recovery Plan, based on a coordinated response to the recession and a longer-term strategy for smart, environmentally sustainable growth and jobs.

The European budget is central to these efforts. It should be refocused on achieving smart, environmentally friendly growth, and meeting future challenges. It should serve to improve living standards and foster social cohesion and growth throughout Europe, as well as supporting convergence of the least-developed EU regions.

A European strategy for smart eco-growth and jobs:

Labour in Europe is proposing a series of measures to promote smart, environmentally sustainable growth and job creation. This would build upon the European Union’s existing strategies to make Europe into the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The European Union institutions and the EU budget should be central to this strategy. EU-funded investment projects should be swiftly implemented to help achieve these goals.

Developing the smart, low-carbon economy in Ireland and in Europe demands far greater availability of broadband across the continent. Multi-billion investments in developing networks are needed throughout Europe. Labour in Europe is proposing greater European investment in broadband infrastructure. The European Investment Bank is already involved in the financing of energy as well as telecoms infrastructure and could step up its commitment. Greater use of European Structural Funds should also be considered. In Ireland, a new Eircom, operating as a public interest company should be linked into this strategy.

Labour in Europe is proposing a European initiative to expand the use of green energy and tackle climate change. Effective use of wind energy, for example, requires new, cross-border grids, the development of which should be supported by Europe. Energy efficiency is one of the best ways to lower people’s fuel bills and create new jobs, for example in the building-insulation sector. We propose active cooperation between the EU, and national and local authorities to help people cope with rising fuel prices by reducing their energy consumption, funding energy efficiency improvements in homes, and ensuring that energy companies’ pricing and customer policies are fair and responsible.

Labour in Europe is proposing a European Pact for the Future of Employment. Advantage should be taken of the possibilities offered by the European Social Fund for integrating the unemployed into the labour market and for training workers. In a global economy, investments in education are fundamental for growth and creating better-paid and better-quality jobs. We propose to fund a Skills Programme through the current EU budget, to train workers across Europe for, amongst other things, the eco-jobs of the future, such as in the renewable energy sector.We will also work towards full and equal access to lifelong learning, with special attention paid to ‘second-chance’ education and training for those who have not completed their formal education. This can be supported by European, national and regional policies. We propose to expand funding, within the current European budget, for education and training exchanges to include, for example, apprentices and older people, building on the success of the ERASMUS programme, and giving as many young people as possible the chance to study abroad. Mobility should be the rule not the exception. Every young European should have the chance to enjoy it.

The EU’s Internal Market should be completed. The Better Regulation Programme which aims to reduce the red tape facing businesses should be accelerated - to generate more European trade and jobs, based on high environmental and social standards. We should simplify the legal framework for SMEs through a statute for European Private Companies, together with easier access to the Internal Market and to financial and innovation resources.

The capital base and credit volumes of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should be increased and the granting of credits simplified for SMEs. Ireland should access more of the extra ?30 billion European Investment Bank funding for firms, use the new flexibility in EU state aid rules to support jobs, opt-in to the new EU rules cutting VAT temporarily on the labour costs of home renovations, and push for Eurobonds to ensure Ireland isn’t penalised for necessary borrowing.

We propose to support businesses to anticipate changes caused by climate change and technological shifts – thereby safeguarding existing jobs and creating new jobs – while also helping workers retrain if they lose their jobs because of these changes. This can be done, in particular, through the reformed Globalisation Adjustment Fund.

We will also support the development of the social economy in Europe – which, for example, currently employs over 5 million people in cooperatives – by introducing a European statute for associations, mutual societies and foundations.

We will support Irish agriculture and the long-term development of the rural economy, with an emphasis on sustainable tourism. The Lisbon Treaty provides for full co-decision powers for the European Parliament in respect of the CAP. While CAP funding is guaranteed until 2013, it is important that Ireland adopt a forward looking perspective on the future of agriculture, and position the sector to ensure it maintains competitive advantage in the post-2013 environment.

The EU can play a role in transforming transport in Europe into the most efficient, affordable and ‘clean’ transport for people and businesses in the world.This includes building a more competitive and affordable high-speed rail network between major cities and regions, and focusing on making it easier to switch between rail and other types of transport; creating an integrated airspace to shorten flying times by allowing aircraft to take more direct routes; making maritime and inland waterway transport cleaner, more efficient and safer for workers and passengers; and transforming our city transport systems.

NEVER AGAIN: Reforming the financial markets

The turmoil in the financial markets revealed the true importance of European cooperation to prevent a collapse of the banking system and stabilise the markets. Coordinated action in the EU has helped to protect people’s jobs, savings, pensions and homes. But the financial crisis has revealed deep-seated flaws in the market system that need to be tackled to prevent such crises happening again. We need reform in Ireland, but we also need reform at European level.

Building on talks that have already taken place in the EU and at global level, Labour in Europe is committed to reform of financial markets. Regulation should cover all financial players. We need a new standard for transparency and disclosure.There should be rigorous capital requirements for all financial players, and limits on excessive borrowing and bad loans to prevent excessive risktaking and debt. Limits are also needed on top executive pay and bonuses, notably so that earnings reflect losses as well as profits.

New rules are needed to prevent conflicts of interest.We must ensure that workers have full rights to information and consultation during all takeovers and that employees paying into pension funds know where and how their money is being invested. Ireland must implement long-standing EU rules designed to protect workers’ pensions in the event of the insolvency of their employer.

The European system of supervision must also be further improved. Financial institutions must state all risks on their balance sheets. Detrimental short-selling made the crisis worse and should be curbed by regulatory authorities. Hedge funds and private equity funds must be monitored and regulated more effectively. The key issues are obligations to disclose asset and regulatory structures, more stringent requirements to inform investors about risks, the limitation of excess debt financing and restrictions on investments.

The European Union should take strong action to deal with tax havens, tax avoidance scams and tax evasion, and step up the fight against money laundering in the European Union and globally so that everyone pays their fair share of tax to the countries in which they operate.

Europe should take a lead in working towards reform of the global financial architecture in order to prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis and to make the power of financial institutions subject to democratic scrutiny.

Labour will continue to press the Fianna Fáil government to implement in full EU rules designed to prevent money-laundering and white collar crime.

2. JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS – A NEW SOCIAL EUROPE

No matter who we are, or where we were born, people in Europe share the same basic values about the kind of society we want to live in: a safer Europe, with high living standards, decent and stable work, and a safe and clean environment.

The European Union has been a progressive force in Irish life for more than 30 years, from equal rights at work for men and women, to decent employment standards, to environmental protection and laws that forbid unfair discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.

However, the global recession, and emerging global challenges, are deepening existing inequalities in our societies, and creating new ones. People across Europe are facing similar challenges, such as unemployment, changes in the labour market, an aging population and work-life balance.

We must tackle these challenges together, so that we can ensure that economic recovery and a fair, strong society go hand in hand.

One step towards a stronger social Europe would be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, and its legally-binding Charter of Fundamental rights, by all member states. The Lisbon Treaty reaffirms respect for human dignity and human rights, equality, non-discrimination, justice and solidarity as the basic values of the Union. It redefines the EU’s core aims to include social progress, social inclusion, social justice, social protection, the social market economy, inter-generational solidarity, and children’s rights; and requires social objectives to be taken into account in the definition and implementation of all policies.

Labour in Europe will seek agreement on a European Social Progress Pact, with goals and standards for national social, health and education policy to contribute to the fight against poverty and as well as Europe’s continued social and economic development. We will do this in partnership with social NGOs and people experiencing poverty directly. We favour needs-based social welfare benefits for all those who are retired, homeless, unemployed or unable to work, to guarantee a life of dignity. We support targeted policies to support those most affected by the economic crisis.

We propose to include a social progress clause in every piece of EU law, and to take into account social and environmental impact assessments when developing new laws. The process of liberalisation must be assessed, particularly in the context of the Lisbon Agenda, which was put in place to open up the single market, and also to forward the agenda of decent work and pay, and workplace equality. We propose that the EU carries out a social audit of its environmental and energy policies to develop measures to prevent these policies hitting the poorest hardest.

We will continue to work for a European framework for public services, guaranteeing universal and equal access for citizens, quality, local autonomy and transparency in public services, maintaining their integrity as defined at national level, so that European competition and business rules do not run counter to citizens’ rights, particularly in the field of social services. We therefore very much welcome the new legal base contained in the Lisbon Treaty, allowing the adoption of such a framework, as well as the new Public Services Protocol contained in the Treaty.

We will continue to support the role played by state aid in fostering economic development and employment, particularly in peripheral and underdeveloped areas and in areas suffering high levels of unemployment.We believe the social and environmental criteria for awarding public contracts under European law should be extended and strengthened.

Taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each member state. Ireland has a veto in this area at the European level, and will retain that veto even if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified. The Labour Party will defend Ireland’s low 12.5% company tax rate, which we introduced when we were in Government in the 1990s.

We will act to prevent the exploitation of workers and defend their right to collective bargaining. A number of recent European Court judgements such as Viking, Laval, Ruffert and Luxembourg, have created uncertainty about workers’ rights and collective agreements. A revision of the 1996 Posting of Workers directive is essential, as are amendments to Irish labour law to avoid a race to the bottom.We want to develop a framework for cross-border collective bargaining and collective agreements. Together with the social partners we will continue to examine the impact of these judgements to ensure that rights are not undermined. In this regard we welcome the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty which would enable the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, which would make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, and the Treaty’s horizontal social clause which would require that in defining and implementing all policies, the EU takes social objectives such as the promotion of a high level of employment, adequate social protection and the fight against social exclusion into consideration.

We support the development of policies based on the concept of flexicurity, i.e. the promotion of employment security through investment in the education and skills of employees, better protection of income after redundancy, and active policy to ensure rapid re-employment after a person loses their job. We will work to promote decent working time, meeting health and safety standards, and a fair work-life balance, in line with the European Parliament’s position on the revision of the Working Time Directive.

We will propose to strengthen workers’ rights to information and consultation – a vital element of a more social Europe and a precondition for decent work. We want to foster greater social dialogue between unions and employers and extend it to more sectors.

We welcome the adoption of EU rules protecting temporary agency workers. We want to see full implementation in Ireland of EU laws protecting the rights of workers on fixed-term contracts, including those in the public service.

We will propose to develop an EU strategy on children’s rights to help eradicate child poverty and guarantee access to education, including pre-school child care. In this regard we particularly welcome the enhanced priority afforded to children’s rights by the Lisbon Treaty. We will also continue to press for the activation in Ireland of a hotline for missing children, as proposed by the EU in 2007.

We propose to establish a European Charter for Internships, to give young people seeking work experience better rights and ensure they benefit from a good start to their working lives.

We will continue to champion consumer rights following our success in securing safer food and cheaper travel and phone calls. We propose to strengthen individual and collective consumers’ rights, and ensure these are properly enforced in the EU.We will demand the full application of EU laws protecting the rights of air passengers and the adoption of similar EU laws covering coach, rail, and sea transport. And we want more effective action against misleading advertising by business directory companies.

We propose setting EU targets for providing care for the elderly, modelled on those already in place for child care, in light of our ageing population and the need to reach the goals of full employment and gender equality. We will continue to work for an EU active ageing strategy, including measures to increase healthy life years and demand the full involvement of older people and organisations working on their behalf in EU policy-making affecting them.

We will campaign to ensure disability is mainstreamed into all areas of EU activity and seek to improve EU support for the de-institutionalisation of people with disabilities. We welcome the role played by the EU in the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Rights for People with Disabilities and want Ireland and all outstanding Member States to ratify this Convention and the adoption of the Council decision enabling the European Union to ratify it also, without further delay.

We support the rapid adoption of proposed European legislation tackling discrimination in the provision of services and goods to people with disabilities and the full implementation in Ireland of European legislation tackling discrimination against people with disabilities in the workplace. We will seek revision of European legislation on the application of social security schemes to workers and their families moving between EU Member States (Regulation 1408/71) so as to facilitate the rights of people with disabilities to qualify for ‘personal assistants’ when they exercise their right to free movement.

We support European action on issues such as tackling health inequalities, rare diseases, pandemic flu preparedness, care-related infections and cancer screening, while reaffirming health as a responsibility of national governments. We welcome the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty which will enable the European Union to play a bigger role in improving health services in cross-border regions, a role which Labour sees as of particular benefit in the border counties in Ireland, and on mental health.

The European Court of Justice has delivered rulings on the question of cross-border health care. These rulings however are not sufficient to ensure the legal safety necessary for the mobility of patients and professionals. Therefore, we believe that the adoption of an EU legislative initiative for health care is necessary. In such an instrument, the EU must ensure a high level of health protection and equal access to health care services for all, as recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Mobility of patients and professionals has to be ensured in compliance with the values and fundamental principles of universality, solidarity, equal access, quality, safety and durability, and the capacity of the Member States to control their health systems.

Reform of the European Union

Labour supports the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. We will seek guarantees from Government on key issues that arose in the referendum campaign, before endorsing a YES vote in a second referendum.

Labour believes that the European Union needs to be reformed, to make it more democratic, and more responsive to the needs of Europe’s citizens. That is why we support the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. We believe, in particular, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important advance in the development of the European Union.

Labour will insist that members of the Dáil have a say in who Ireland’s next European commissioner should be, and that the candidate must be ratified by the Dáil.We require that the nominee be committed to social and economic reform and pursue an agenda of jobs and justice. We support the creation of a commissioner with overarching responsibility for job creation and retention.

In the European Parliament Labour MEPs will only vote for a Commission President who is also committed to an agenda promoting social and economic reform; jobs and justice.

We support the creation of a commissioner with overall responsibility for pursuing equality in all areas of EU policy and law making.

Labour in the European Parliament has worked to ensure that the new Parliament, elected in June, will be subject to a new transparent regime of salaries and allowances for MEPs. Labour’s representative in the European Parliament has already put this information on his website.

We will ensure that democracy, transparency and accountability are cornerstones of all reforms of the European institutions.We propose to strengthen transparency by obliging all lobbyists and lobby agencies to register themselves, their clients, and their activities, including all contacts with elected representatives, as well as with civil servants and other officials.

We will ensure that EU legislation respects citizens’ rights as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. We will strengthen anti-discrimination legislation to ensure equal treatment on grounds of gender, race, disability, age, sexual orientation and religion or belief.We fully support the adoption of the draft directive tackling discrimination in the provision of goods and services as proposed by the European Commission in 2008, and will continue to campaign for the full implementation of EU anti-discrimination laws in Ireland.

We support equal treatment for all EU citizens, without discrimination, when they move around the Union by moving towards recognition in all EU countries of marriages, partnerships and parental rights legally recognised in one of the Member States.

We advocate giving regions and local authorities a greater role in European affairs, reflecting their growing role in implementing European policies and promoting discussion of European questions at the sub-national level. We support the recognition and fostering of Europe’s cultural and linguistic diversity, as one of its richest assets and a key part of its identity.

3. TRANSFORMING EUROPE INTO A REAL FORCE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

Global warming is the kind of problem the European Union exists to solve: it transcends borders, it threatens our common future, and it can only be solved by collective action. The need for a world leader in the fight against climate change has never been more urgent. Through its market of 490 million people, and its diplomatic power, the European Union can achieve far more in December’s international climate change negotiations than each nation working alone.

Breaking our dependence on imported fossil fuels is essential if we are to meet the challenge of global warming, and to protect our economy from high energy prices. Ireland could be a world leader in renewable energy, but we need to be part of a European grid, with access to a large energy market.

We have to act now, and together, if we are to secure our future.

Labour in Europe will advocate that the EU takes the lead in international negotiations to get agreement on at least a 30% global target for emission reductions by 2020 at the UN Copenhagen summit in December. All developed and emerging economies should sign up to this. We are committed to a global approach based on solidarity.

We propose to increase EU support for developing countries to fight as well as adapt to climate change. The EU should increase technology transfers to ensure that these countries can fight poverty and develop economically without worsening global warming.We must also take steps to avoid the risk that energy intensive industries will move to other parts of the world where the climate change requirements are less strict.

We propose that the EU should take the lead in establishing a Global Energy and Development Forum, bringing all nations together to define a long-term vision for energy and the sustainable development of the planet.

We propose to introduce a comprehensive EU climate directive that would ensure that targets and actions in all those sectors not already covered by existing law – energy, agriculture, food, building and transport – are combined to enable the EU to reach its overall emission targets. All other climate legislation should also be adapted to meet the 30% emissions reduction target.

We support the development of a European Common Energy Policy based on sustainability, energy security and independence, diversity of energy sources and solidarity between Member States in the event of energy crises.

We support a modern Common Agricultural Policy that promotes comprehensive rural development and values the fundamental role of farmers. We recognise the role of agriculture in ensuring food quality and security of supply, maintaining economic activity and employment in rural areas, protecting the environment and preserving the landscape, and protecting animal welfare and plant health.

We welcome the enhanced decision-making role for the European Parliament over European fisheries policy, as well as the establishment of Regional Advisory Councils involving local communities in the areas of fisheries, as proposed by the Lisbon Treaty. Our unique marine sector must be supported and promoted, especially during a period where it faces major challenges due to serious neglect over the past ten years. We believe that, if properly managed, Ireland’s sea fisheries have the potential to be both profitable and sustainable in the long-term.

We support the revision of the Biofuels Directive to ensure that the lowering of transport emissions through biofuels is not at the expense of food production, environmental protection or biodiversity.

We propose that the monitoring of existing and new nuclear power plants should be better coordinated at the European level, due to the threats posed by existing plants like Sellafield and the importance of nuclear safety for all European countries. We will support the revision and insertion of a ‘sunset’ clause into the Euratom Treaty.

We will continue to press for high environmental standards in Ireland by supporting the full implementation of EU environmental laws, particularly those concerning the Aarhus Convention, environmental impact assessments, environmental liability, landfills, urban waste water treatment, waste, and water quality, all of which have been the subject of unnecessary legal delays by the Government over the past two years. We will urge the Commission to come forward with proposals for a biowaste directive and for a revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings directive.

4. PROMOTING JUSTICE IN IRELAND AND EUROPE

The European Union is far more than an economic union: it is a community of values. The EU is a powerful engine of progressive social change, and the reason why Europeans’ rights to equality, democracy, and freedom are protected from Galway Bay to the Black Sea.

However, despite significant progress, there is still more to do to ensure the equal treatment and dignity of those who live and work in Europe. Women in Ireland still earn an average of 17% less than men for the same work, and 15% less across the EU; work-life balance for parents is still uneven across Europe; and there are still too few women in politics.

We can do more too to address the common challenge of migration, and to enact real reforms to ensure integration, fight illegal migration, illegal work and human trafficking, and work to create a better life for people in poorer countries outside Europe.

Together we can build a fairer society, not just for ourselves, but for all who live and work in Europe.

Labour in Europe will work to create a European Women’s Rights Charter to improve women’s rights and opportunities and to promote mechanisms to achieve gender equality in all aspects of social, economic and political life.

We will work to introduce improved parental leave rights for men and women across Europe up to the highest standards in Europe.

We will campaign for equal political representation of women and men in all decision-making bodies at European level. We will campaign for a gender-equal European Commission and a gender-equal European Parliament, and will call for the creation of a European Commissioner for Gender Equality.

We will work to support parents so that they can balance their caring responsibilities with their professional responsibilities. To support this goal, we propose that Member States achieve the existing EU target of 33% child care coverage for 0-3 year olds and 90% coverage for children from 3-school age, and adopt complementary EU qualitative targets for child care.

Lead the fight to close the gender pay gap, which is vital to improve living standards, fight poverty and increase economic growth.

We propose to step up European efforts to eradicate human trafficking and sexual exploitation through closer police cooperation, and particularly welcome the new provisions in the Lisbon Treaty on these problems.

We will support the EU and its Member States in their efforts to stop domestic and gender-specific violence, including that perpetrated against women of ethnic minorities, through all appropriate EU programmes and funds.

The EU’s Daphne programme provides funds to NGOs involved in helping the victims of physical, sexual and psychological violence such as children, young people and women. With our allies in the Socialist Group, Labour in Europe succeeded in preventing the Commission from merging the Daphne programme with an anti-drugs programme and achieved a 50% increase in funding for the Daphne III programme from 2007 to 2013.

We support the establishment of common standards for legal migration into the European Union, while fully respecting Member States’ competences in this field.

We will work to establish a European Charter for the Integration of Migrants, based on equal rights and responsibilities and mutual respect, which should be coordinated closely with policies governing the admission of migrants. We want an integration policy that establishes an ongoing process to achieve inclusive citizenship and representation, as well as rights and duties for all citizens.

We will work to improve European efforts to combat illegal migration through a common External Border Control Policy, improved cooperation to fight human trafficking by criminal networks, and partnership agreements with third countries.

We commit to strengthening cooperation with third countries (including on readmission procedures) in order to manage migration more effectively and more humanely, while promoting the economic and social development of those countries. We propose to deepen existing mechanisms, and create new ones, to address the consequences for developing countries of the loss of skilled workers in key sectors due to migration into the EU.

We support the further development of the Common European Asylum System, based on fair asylum rules for those fleeing persecution and on international human rights rules and burdensharing amongst EU Member States. European cooperation is essential for an effective migration policy. This can only be achieved with a strong progressive majority in Europe.

5. ENHANCING EUROPE’S ROLE AS A FORCE FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT

The EU should be a frontrunner in advancing peace and sustainable social and economic development worldwide. We believe that Europe needs a stronger common voice in the world to shape a better future for our citizens and the planet. We must work together for peace and partnership, and to eradicate poverty, in solidarity with people across the world.

Europe is already an active global player, but we must increase our influence and impact by coordinating our positions and speaking as much as possible with a single voice. Strengthening the role of the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy will be an important step forward.Today’s global governance institutions have proved themselves to be ill-adapted to new global challenges. Therefore, we must take the lead in reforming global governance – in partnership with the new Democratic Party administration in the US – on the basis of a strengthened cooperative and multilateral approach.

A new, progressive European agenda is essential to enhance the EU’s role in promoting peace, security and development, for the sake of our own future development and security as well as solidarity with other countries and peoples.

Labour in Europe will propose that European Union must step up its conflict-resolution, peacekeeping, and humanitarian efforts in crisis zones, and develop capacities to assist countries after civil or environmental crises. We must remove the root causes of conflict and terrorism in the world. Development policy towards poor, developing countries must be targeted, innovative and based on the real needs and the involvement of people at grassroots level. It should support the important role of women in development for example by extending access to microcredit schemes.

We propose to strengthen police cooperation in combating drug trafficking, crime and terrorism. Fighting against terrorism should be a top priority and needs to be further strengthened as an EU objective, within the rule of law and without compromising fundamental freedoms. We will continue to promote a common European strategy against terrorism and support for the EU Special Representative.

Actions to counter terrorism have to be a priority for Europe and the cooperation of all member states security forces. As we know from our experience in Ireland we will be most successful when we seek to win the hearts and minds of those who are likely to become involved in such activity, either directly or indirectly. The notorious ‘extraordinary rendition’ that denied completely innocent people of their human rights, and subjected them to torture, must never happen again. Such actions undermine the basis of the decent society we are trying to create. In the European parliament we will continue to press for the implementation of the recommendations of the European Parliament inquiry into the CIA extraordinary renditions in Europe. Many of those recommendations relate to Ireland’s government and its collusive role in that notorious programme, as confirmed by the Irish Commission on Human Rights, and Amnesty International.

We support the implementation in Ireland and in all Member States and at EU level of the recommendations of the European Parliament’s Committee of Inquiry into extraordinary rendition.

We propose to ensure that the EU establishes coherent disaster prevention tools.

We propose to step up European efforts to support international disarmament, including strengthening international agreements on arms control and non-proliferation, and making the EU Code of Conduct on weapons exports more restrictive and transparent.We want a world without nuclear weapons. To that end, we will ensure that the EU takes a lead role in the Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2010.

Labour in Europe supports a ‘two-state’ solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is more vital than ever for the European Union to engage actively in making it possible for the parties to the conflict in the region to engage in real negotiations towards that end.While continuing to provide humanitarian and development aid to Palestinians, Europe must insist that as a first step that Israeli Settlements be stopped, the siege on Gaza lifted, and house demolitions in East Jerusalem and elsewhere by Israel must cease. All factions of the Palestinian elected representatives must accept the conditions of the Quartet of the UNO, Europe, Russia and USA as a basis of political progress.

We also fully support the independent inquiry by the Geneva Council for Human Rights into the prima facie evidence of breaches of the Geneva Convention during the recent Israeli assault against Gaza, in which over 1000 civilians were killed. For this inquiry to satisfactorily complete its work, all European Member States must pro-actively support it, in particular those such as Ireland, which claims to support it but has not done so to date.

We propose that the EU actively promotes an ‘Alliance of Civilisations’ through the UN, strengthening dialogue and partnership between peoples and cultures as a means to enhance world peace and security.

We will reaffirm Ireland’s policy of military neutrality, which is fully compatible with its membership of the EU.

We will advocate for the reform of the United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council, as well as the revision of the decision-making process, mandate and functioning of the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the regional banks, and the International Monetary Fund. The allocation of voting rights in the IMF must better reflect the interests of developing countries, particularly the poorest amongst them.

We will continue to promote a moratorium in the application of the death penalty in the United Nations, as an interim objective in the campaign to achieve the global abolition of the death penalty.

We support the ongoing negotiations with Turkey and other European states with a view to eventual membership of the Union. These negotiations must take place in the context of compliance with and a capacity to implement European Union economic, legal, and human rights obligations. The Copenhagen Criteria, on which membership of all applicants is based, would become legally enforceable under the Lisbon Treaty.

We welcome membership talks with Croatia and support the start of EU membership negotiations with all other Western Balkans countries, once all the criteria have been met.We believe that the EU should respect the fundamental rights of all peoples as well as supporting the multicultural and multi-religious nature of European societies.

We will continue to build a strong transatlantic partnership with the new US Democratic Party leadership.

We support deeper EU relations with China, encouraging improved human rights, and social and environmental standards, alongside a deepening of trade relations.We strongly support closer ties with India as an emerging global actor, based on mutual respect and open dialogue.We will work to fully implement and consolidate the Africa-EU Strategy to strengthen relations, solve common challenges, conclude fair Economic Partnership Agreements, and support the long-term development of Africa.

We will use this Parliamentary term to push for efforts to reach the United Nations Millennium Goals by 2015. We propose to put value-based and coherent development goals at the heart of EU policies on aid, trade and the reform of global governance. New, innovative sources of financing are needed in addition to delivering existing European aid commitments – notably, attributing at least 0.7% of Gross National Income to development policy – in a more coordinated, efficient and targeted way. We support decentralised cooperation in European development policy, including the contribution that can be made by Europe’s local authorities.We will support the establishment of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, as proposed by the Lisbon Treaty. We will continue to campaign against child labour and high maternal mortality rates in developing countries.

We will advocate that the EU supports the multilateral trading system, to the benefit of developing countries in the WTO Doha Development Round, and to ensure a fairer domestic distribution of the benefits of trade opening, as well as guaranteeing better social and environmental standards.

We will work to address the global food crisis by working to prevent further speculation on food prices, and to promote food security by developing a new generation of aid and agricultural production policies.

We will work to ensure that all EU trade agreements include appropriate, enforceable human, environmental and social rights clauses and that all trade agreements with developing countries such as Economic Partnership Agreements - serve as real tools for the economic and social development of the countries and regions concerned.

We will work to promote the expansion of fair trade goods. Promoting and raising awareness of fair trade measures will encourage sustainable development and help to guarantee decent wages for those in the developing world, contributing to improving the lives of millions of people worldwide.

We will make decent work a global objective to which all countries as well as international institutions and organisations are committed. This new global agenda must uphold core labour standards as well as promoting decent working conditions, adequate wages, social security and strengthened social dialogue.

1. Sinn Féin: A Positive Voice in Europe A Voice for Change in Europe Your Voice in Europe

Sinn Féin wants Ireland to play a central role in shaping the future direction of the European Union. Our two MEPs, Bairbre de Brún and Mary Lou McDonald, since their election in 2004 have been a positive and constructive voice in the European Parliament.

Sinn Fein’s approach to the EU is guided by a simple principle. We actively support proposals and measures that are in the interests of Ireland and the EU as a whole and campaign to change those that are not.

In the European Parliament Sinn Féin has supported measures that:

protect workers rights and public services promote environmental protection and sustainability promote balanced regional development protect and promote the rural economy provide greater democracy and accountability in the EU institutions protect Irish neutrality and oppose increased militarisation of the EU promote greater human rights protection for all promote fair trade and greater equality for the developing world

The record of our MEPs speaks for itself. They have worked with others to advance the interests of Ireland and the European Union and to protect the rights and entitlements of ordinary people in Ireland, across Europe and the wider world.

Sinn Féin has put the interests of Ireland first in Europe – our people, our rural communities, our natural environment and our future prosperity.

Sinn Féin has led the way in developing a new working relationship with the EU that will deliver real results. We have provided real leadership in demanding that Ireland – North and South – is not squeezed out of the decision making process. Sinn Féin is a positive voice in Europe. We are a voice for change in Europe. We are your voice in Europe.

Sinn Féin’s Record in the European Parliament

Since their election to the European Parliament in 2004 Bairbre de Brún and Mary Lou Mac Donald have:

2. Building Support in Europe for Irish Re-unification

The border in Ireland is one of the least open in the EU when it comes to cross-border social and economic development. The Good Friday Agreement provides a road-map for the intensification of cross-border cooperation on a range of issues. Sinn Féin believes that the only way to truly transform the economy in Ireland is through an island-wide strategy for development and regeneration. There are a number of ways in which the EU can support such developments.

Sinn Féin launched a document on EU support for Irish reunification in 2006, outlining how the EU could help overcome the legacy of partition and support the reunification of Ireland. Among the proposals are:

The EU should encourage the Irish Government to allow for the participation of elected representatives from all over Ireland in the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The EU, and British and Irish Governments, should allow for an active role for members of the Executive in the Council of EU Ministers.

Development of a single National Reform Programme on economic and social development, to include all-Ireland harmonisation of taxes and of regulation on employment, social cohesion and the environment.

Development of a single EU Community Support Framework to ensure that strategic planning can take place on an all-Ireland basis and that the EU can treat Ireland as a single entity for funding purposes. Provision for the Assembly to democratically “opt-in” to EU Directives where the British Government has opted-out in order to ensure that the whole island is operating within the same social and economic framework.

Exemption from state aid provisions to allow governments to make strategic investments to deal with the social, economic and structural distortions caused by partition. Introduction of the Euro in the North.

Sinn Fein MEPs will continue to raise these issues and campaign for the EU to support Irish reunification.

Using EU Structural Funds to Build National Reconciliation and Regional Equality

The EU’s structural funds have benefited Ireland, North and South. Cohesion policy is a success of the European Union. It is also one of the most visible EU policies for people of the Members States.

Newer Member States deserve the same chances that Ireland got through the structural funds. Sinn Féin in Europe has been vocal in our support for a strong, well-financed EU structural funds programme based on solidarity between regions.

The Sinn Féin team in Europe has prioritised Ireland’s regions in our work. The North-West of our country has lost out immeasurably because of partition. Our work in the European Parliament has empowered people from this region and from across Ireland to demand that they and their regions are treated on the basis of equality.

Sinn Féin played an important role in the lobbying that brought about the PEACE III programme. In a report overwhelmingly backed by MEPs in 2008 we highlighted the role of the PEACE programme to aid the process of national reconciliation through funding projects which genuinely redress the injustices of the past and bring communities together.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Fight for Ireland’s regions and for an allIreland dynamic to structural fund spending. Work with the Task Force set-up by the European Commission to make sure we maximise the efficiency of our structural fund receipts.

Work to have sustainable development and social inclusion at the heart of EU funding regulations.

3. For Positive Change in the European Union

In 2008 almost one million voters in the South of Ireland voted against the Lisbon Treaty. It was the same decision as that taken by two of the founding members of the European Union, France and the Netherlands, who two years earlier rejected the same package of proposals. In the North citizens were denied the right to vote on the issue by the British Government.

Like the people of France and the Netherlands, voters in Ireland were concerned with issues of democracy, public services, workers rights, environmental protection, militarisation, and trade.

The Irish people who had an opportunity to vote were – like the people of France and the Netherlands – saying yes to a more democratic, a more equitable and a more peaceful European Union.

Sinn Féin believes that the EU needs reform. Immediately after the defeat of the Lisbon Treaty in 2008 we presented detailed proposals to the Irish Government on what we believed would be required for the people of Ireland to support any new Treaty.

The global recession has demonstrated the failures of the economic and social policies pursued by the Irish and British Governments, and the European Union. These same economic policies are pushed even further in the Lisbon Treaty. Now more than ever it is time for a new treaty for the new times in which we find ourselves.

We need a new treaty that brings greater democracy to the EU, returning power to people and Member States. We need a treaty that sets out economic and social policies that prioritise prosperity with equality and sustainability. We need a treaty that protects Irish neutrality and that sets its face against the creeping militarisation of the EU and foreign and defence policies decided by NATO.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Oppose any Lisbon Treaty re-run as antidemocratic.

Support negotiation of a new treaty for a new time, based on the recommendations made by Sinn Fein, reflecting the concerns of the Irish people.

Campaign for the people of the North to exercise a vote on any future Treaty.

For a More Democratic EU

Sinn Féin has campaigned for greater democracy and accountability in the EU. Unfortunately, the democratic deficit remains. Decisions are made far from ordinary people, with little scrutiny, and in a way that prevents their active participation.

The gap between ordinary people and the European Commission, Council and Parliament is growing. As a result decisions taken in the EU do not reflect peoples’ real concerns or needs.

Sinn Féin MEPs will continue to promote a more democratic EU by:

Promoting a real agenda for greater EU democracy.

Strengthening the role of regional and national parliaments and local authorities. Defending the wishes of Member State citizens as democratically expressed in referenda.

Reducing the power of the unelected and unaccountable Commission.

Assessing each piece of legislation on its overall impact on Ireland.

Proposing reform of MEP parliamentary allowance system to ensure that all expenses claimed are vouched and full details are published.

Calling for an end to the system where sitting MEPs claim Oireachtas/ Ministerial pensions.

4. For Sustainable Prosperity With Equality

The scale of the economic challenge facing us in Europe and in Ireland demands a new approach to creating and sustaining jobs, protecting the rights of workers and tackling poverty. Across Europe billions are being pumped into the financial sector yet it is ordinary people who are losing their jobs and their homes.

The current EU economic policy is fundamentally flawed in that it prioritises market competition over more important economic and social goals such as full employment, social justice and environmental sustainability.

We believe the current economic crisis requires the EU to rethink its strategy and place the interests of people at the heart of its decisionmaking. The ways in which EU economic policy (the Lisbon Strategy 2000 and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines) restrict government room to manoeuvre in response to the crisis must be addressed as a matter of urgency.

Sinn Féin will continue to work at local, Assembly, Dáil and EU levels to promote viable and effective solutions to the economic crisis that restore a more sustainable prosperity, with greater equality.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Work to change the existing EU economic policy guidelines to promote sustainable economic growth, full employment, social justice and environmental protection.

Oppose market supremacy, deregulation and liberalisation and promote a new approach to economic policy which ensures that sustainable prosperity is underpinned by equality.

Place the ‘green economy’ at the heart of economic development and new job opportunities.

For Using EU Funds to Create Jobs

Getting Irish workers back to work is a priority for Sinn Féin. With the global recession and the financial sector implosion creating a cash flow crisis for Irish businesses, any recovery plan must focus on ensuring that we have the infrastructure, skills, services and access to credit and other supports required to save and create jobs.

There are a number of key areas where EU funds and programmes could help make a difference. The European Commission’s Economic Recovery Plan includes concrete proposals of particular interest to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). And we need to maximise EU assistance to grasp the real opportunities in developing sectors with the greatest potential, including and especially our green economy.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Sinn Féin will take every measure to support and protect public services, and oppose all proposals for liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation. We will campaign to restore the right of the Dáil and Assembly to decide which public services are exempt from EU competition and state aid rules and organise and fund them accordingly.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Oppose the liberalisation and privatisation of key public services (such as education and health) and campaign to ensure that such services remain the exclusive responsibility of Member States.


Campaign for Member States to retain control of key “economic” services such as transport, communications, housing, water and energy services.

Oppose moves to subject health services to market rules and regulations.

For Protecting Workers’ Rights

Despite its prior track record, in recent years the EU has actually weakened the rights of working people and undermined the ability of trade unions to negotiate better conditions for workers. It has also restricted the ability of governments to legislate for improved pay and conditions.

The EU is now promoting insecure employment and lower wages. It is pitting worker against worker, company against company, and country against country in its drive to increase competitiveness through lower wages and worker ‘flexibility’.

Sinn Féin has been to the fore in opposing any move to undermine the pay and conditions of working people in Ireland and across the EU.

Sinn Féin MEPs will continue to promote workers rights, and will:

Fight against the relocation of businesses and jobs to lower wage economies and ensure that companies cannot relocate to other jurisdictions within the EU on this basis.

Campaign for EU support for retraining of workers affected by company closures. Oppose attacks on workers rights, such as the proposed increase of working hours. Continue to campaign for a “Social Progress Clause” in any future EU Treaty which would guarantee that pay and employment conditions cannot be undermined by rulings of the European Court of Justice.

Combat and reverse the rising trend towards precarious work.

Support the equal rights of migrant workers and their families, which effectively protects the rights of all workers.

Support job security and good employment conditions, in opposition to EU proposals to make it easier for employers to fire people and reduce benefits such as holidays and pensions.

Fight against reductions in unemployment benefits and social welfare payments.

For Ending Economic Inequality and Poverty

Work to maximise the job creation potential of EU transport and energy programmes such as TENS (Trans European Networks), Concerto, Intelligent Energy, and Civitas. Encourage access to the EU funds to boost affordable, high speed broadband services in rural areas.

Promote involvement in the sustainable development strategy through projects supported financially under Life+.

Ensure EU funds part-finance a programme of energy efficiency renovations that would provide support to our construction industry, saving jobs and creating jobs while at the same time playing a part in meeting our climate change obligations and tackling fuel poverty.

Continue to support local small and medium businesses to access EU finance. Strengthen SME access to and participation in public procurement specifically by adapting the size of contracts and alleviating the administrative and financial burden in tendering and by using e-procurement.

For Protecting Public Services

Current EU economic policy promotes the opening up of vital public services to private competition (‘liberalisation’). It promotes weaker regulation, encouraging the sort of abuses we have seen recently in the banking sector. The result has been greater deregulation and ultimately privatisation of public services. This has increased social inequality even during periods of economic growth. More fundamentally, such policies are at the root of the present economic crisis.

Some 78 million people across the EU (16% of the total population) are at risk of poverty. In Ireland the figure is higher than the EU average, at 16.5% in the South and 20% in the North. With rising unemployment and falling incomes this situation is getting worse. Some groups in society experience greater inequality than others: children, lone parents, older people, the unemployed, people with disabilities, members of minority groups and those living in disadvantaged areas. People facing multiple discrimination are more likely to be at risk of poverty.

One of the key ways for people to get out of poverty is through employment, which must be a priority, However poverty is also about access to housing and services, and ultimately about human dignity and respect.

Sinn Féin endorses the demand to make social cohesion and the fight against poverty and economic inequality an EU priority.

Sinn Féin brought together MEPs from different Member States and diverse political backgrounds and achieved overwhelming support for a declaration on street homelessness in the European Parliament calling for action by the EU and Member States.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work to ensure:

The European Economic Recovery Plan contributes to the priority of ending poverty and inequality.

Comprehensive EU legislation to protect economic and social rights, and build on progress made with regard to access to goods and services.

Equal access to good quality social, educational, child care and health services, and housing, transport, energy and water services.

Greater EU support for the social economy. EU targets for ending homelessness.

A guaranteed minimum income in order to ensure a dignified life for everybody.

A link between pensions and average earnings.

For Protecting Ireland’s Rural Economy

Agriculture remains one of Ireland’s most important industries. Its cultural and traditional role in Irish society also makes it critically important for Ireland and for Sinn Féin both here at home and in the EU.

Sinn Féin’s MEPs will work with our Agriculture Minister in the north, Michelle Gildernew and our colleagues in the south to ensure that Irish farmers have a strong all-Ireland voice at all levels in the EU.

We know the realities that farmers and in particular small farmers face because of EU regulations and will work with farming organisations to let Europe hear these concerns.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Support reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that make Irish farming and the rural economy more sustainable and prosperous.

Continue to work with Irish farmers in dealing with the burden of EU regulations. Present an all-Ireland voice for our rural economy especially in practical areas like animal health.

Oppose all EU plans to allow genetically modified (GM) crops to be grown in Ireland, in keeping with our commitment to a GM crop-free Ireland, and support a strict and full liability regime which places the burden on companies and farmers using/producing GM crops.

Brief farmers and rural communities on EU developments, and facilitate their engagement with the EU institutions and other actors.

Support the development of a Rural White Paper (in the North) and the shaping of policies at EU level to support our rural communities and rural economy.

Sacrificing our coastal fishing rights for other short-term perceived advantages has damaged the sustainability of our fishing communities. We will stand with our fishing communities and fight for a better, fairer deal that will allow Ireland to benefit from the resources in our seas and to revitalise our coastal communities.

To protect our natural resources and coastal communities, Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Work to ensure a sustainable future for our fishing communities.

Push for a renegotiation of the CFP to get a better deal for Ireland.

Work with our fishing communities to make sure their voice is heard in Brussels. Assert the primacy of Irish sovereignty in discussions about how our natural resources in our territorial waters are managed.

For Challenging the EU Competition Rules

EU competition regulations (or state aid rules) severely restrict the investments a Member State or regional or local government can make in its own economy. These rules are simply too inflexible to allow for state involvement when it is necessary. Sinn Féin is opposed to this approach, which is based on the EU’s flawed economic strategy.

For example, government investment in rural areas through supporting loss-making rural post offices is questionable under EU rules, as would be moves by the Irish Government or the Assembly to protect

essential industry and jobs. The final decision in these cases rests with the European Court of Justice which has a history of prioritising the free market and private profit over balanced and sustainable social, economic, regional and rural development.

The European Commission and European Court of Justice should not have the power to block essential social, economic or environmental investments. Nor should governments use the EU Competition Rules as a convenient excuse for not properly supporting public services.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Oppose the free-market primacy in the EU’s state aid rules.

Seek an exemption from these rules to allow for the reunification of Ireland as is currently permitted in the case of German reunification.

Challenge any attempt to use these EU rules as an excuse for lack of government action in supporting public services and our essential industries and social infrastructure.

For Making Irish Fisheries Viable

Sinn Féin has been critical of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) since its inception. We have consistently argued that the CFP amounts to a gross violation of Irish territorial waters. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973 over €100 billion worth of fish has been mined from our seas, principally by non-Irish fleets.

For Irish Sovereignty Over Taxation

Recent years have seen the EU gain more power to set the parameters within which national and regional governments can operate their economies, and in particular exercise control over taxation.

VAT rules are already set at EU level. Moves have been made to bring corporation tax into the remit of the EU through the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). This is supported by the European Commission and Parliament, as well as many Member States in the European Council – and even some Irish MEPs.

Sinn Féin believes that essential economic policy should be controlled by democratically elected national or regional governments. Sinn Féin MEPs have an impeccable record of defending Ireland’s right to set its own tax base and consequently our own corporate tax rate.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Be the strongest advocates of Irish economic sovereignty and all-Ireland tax harmonisation.

Strengthen Ireland’s voice in opposing greater EU control over taxation including EU-wide tax harmonisation.

For Fair International Trade

The EU is a major economic force but has been using this strength to impose a free trade agenda which benefits corporations instead of using it to promote sustainable development. Because of EU-imposed free trade agreements developing countries have been unable to pursue a natural course of development which would first and foremost serve the needs of their own peoples.

In addition the power that the EU has to negotiate international trade deals on behalf of all Member States has been damaging to certain economic sectors that the EU feels are better and more cheaply undertaken outside the EU.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Seek to safeguard the economic sectors most at risk from globalisation, and in particular agriculture.

Promote fair trade rather than unrestricted free trade as the guiding principle of the EU’s economic relations with other countries.

Campaign for the introduction of a tax on global currency speculation, such as the Tobin Tax.

5. For Robust Environmental Protection

Biodiversity and a clean environment are vital natural resources. Facing us are both challenges in dealing with our waste and habitat loss, and opportunities in using wind, solar and wave energy.

The environment has been a key issue for us in Brussels and Strasbourg. The EU has brought forward much positive environmental protection legislation which Sinn Féin actively supports.

In particular, Sinn Féin has been involved in legislation:

Limiting the effect of chemicals on our health (the REACH Directive).

Shaping future waste management policies promoting reduction, reuse and recycling. Supporting binding targets on renewable energy sources so that Ireland can fully benefit from our potential domestic resources (in particular wind and wave).

Sinn Féin has raised local environmental issues at an EU level such as residents’ groups’ concerns around landfills, incinerators, asbestos dumps and the Shell pipeline at Rossport.

Sinn Féin has campaigned against incinerators in Poolbeg, Rathcoole and other communities across Ireland. At EU level we have opposed moves to brand incineration as “recovery” rather than “disposal”. This reclassification would ultimately mean more incinerators in our communities.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Prioritise environmental protection by supporting the highest level of environmental standards in EU legislation in Strasbourg, and by holding authorities at home to these standards.

Support EU leadership in the promotion of sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels.

Promote concerted action on ecosystems and the development and better implementation of successful EU biodiversity policies such as the Birds and Habitats Directives and the Natura 2000 network of protected areas.

Review all electromagnetic field (EMF) regulations in line with the findings of the Bioinitiative report on the health effects caused by increased exposure to wireless devices.

Call for the revision of EU regulations so that public interest groups can seek judicial reviews of EU decisions in relation to environmental matters.

For Urgent Action on Climate Change

Climate Change represents one of the greatest challenges facing Ireland and Europe. Sinn Féin has contributed greatly to shaping EU and Irish

policy on climate change. We have engaged with experts at home and across Europe on different aspects of climate change.

Our approach to climate change is to recognise it as not just a northern or southern or even Irish problem but to place it in its international context. Our membership of the European Parliament’s Temporary Committee on Climate Change has allowed us to input our ideas at each point of decision-making – locally, nationally and at EU level.

We support binding legislation committing the government in the South to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 3% annually in order to meet international obligations, and have prioritised climate action in our input into the Programme for Government in the North.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Seek to have climate goals incorporated across a range of policy areas.

Resist attempts to reduce targets for emissions cuts set by Brussels.

Push for a progressive mandate to be given to EU, through our role in the European Parliament, in future world climate talks. Support the Copenhagen Pledge drawn up by Christian Aid in advance of the UN climate talks in December 2009.

Work to ensure that developing nations are treated fairly and adequately supported by the EU to play their role in coping with the global challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This should include new and additional funding over and above Overseas Development Aid.

Campaign in particular for finance to stop and reverse deforestation.

Continue to promote opportunities in renewable energy and energy efficiency as a way of boosting the local economy and tackling climate change and fuel poverty. Work to make the EU target for a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 mandatory.

Unequivocally reject the use and promotion of nuclear energy in Ireland and across Europe and continue to campaign for the closure of Sellafield.

Work to end EU subsidies from export credit agencies and public investment banks for nuclear projects.

Campaign for greater financial and legislative incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy.

For Safe Renewable Energy and Against Nuclear Power

Energy has become a major issue in the EU and at home. Renewable energy must become one of the growth areas for Ireland, North and South in the time ahead. Sinn Féin believes that an all-Ireland energy network powered by a domestic, renewable supply provides the best means of energy security for Ireland. We are endowed with huge potential in renewable energy resources and should invest in these clean technologies as a priority.

We support the mandatory EU target of 20% for renewable energy use by 2020. We reject completely suggestions that nuclear energy has any role to play in reducing Ireland’s carbon emissions, as it is not a safe renewable source.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Support moves to increase the output of renewable energy across Ireland, including biofuels where these are environmentally and socially sustainable.

Campaign for an all-Ireland energy network that is self-sufficient and sustainable.

6. For Equality, Human Rights and Civil Liberties

Freedom, justice and human rights should be the cornerstone of EU policy on Justice and Home Affairs. However much of the EU’s current policy is fixated on increasing surveillance and restrictions on people’s rights – creating instead a Fortress Europe security state.

This is the principal reason we oppose the trend towards EU integration and centralisation of policing and judicial powers. However we also believe that these are primarily matters for sovereign states. To be valid, any EU harmonisation or cooperation measures should require unanimity and also have as their objective the increased protection of human rights.

Sinn Féin supports measures which genuinely combat international crime or assist legitimate freedom of movement. Any EU-wide cooperation systems in policing or migration management must be guided by human rights standards and accompanied by the necessary accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure they are not abused. We do not support the Schengen system as we believe that it does not meet these criteria.

Sinn Féin supports comprehensive EU legislation to protect and promote equality and diversity, human rights and civil liberties. Our MEPs will oppose any EU measure which is not fully human rightscompliant and consistent with international law.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Promote the right to participate to the EU decision-making process and campaign for full and equal accessibility of the EU institutions and its facilities.

Continue to help women, older people, people with disabilities, LGBT people, migrants and asylum seekers to bring their issues directly to EU decision makers and ensure their voices are heard in Europe, through participation in Inter-Group and other mechanisms.

Build on progress made in relation to the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.

Promote EU support for disability mainstreaming, disability-proofing, universal design requirements and the right to live independently.

Work to ensure that older people can move freely within the EU without losing their pension rights.

Support the European Women’s Lobby ‘50/50 Campaign’, demanding equal gender representation in all EU institutions. (We note with pride that the Sinn Féin EU election slate is more than 50% women.) Support the equal rights of LGBT citizens, including the rights to freedom of movement and family reunification through partnership recognition, an inclusive definition of the family in EU law and policy, and explicit recognition of transgender people’s equal rights.

Support the right of all persons seeking protection to be treated according to the same highest standards across all Member States.

Oppose detention of asylum seekers.

Work to end the restriction of asylum seekers’ and refugees’ access to employment.

Promote the right to family reunification. Support EU-level and international cooperation in criminal justice matters where this clearly serves the public interest. Not agree to cede national sovereignty over or democratic oversight of, and oppose any moves towards establishing exclusive EU competence over, any area of justice. Ensure robust scrutiny of all EU measures proposed under Justice and Home Affairs at European Parliament, Oireachtas and Assembly level post-devolution, to ensure that these adhere to human rights and international law standards, contain adequate safeguards, and serve the best interests of the Irish people.

Sinn Féin has pushed consistently for a removal of these derogations which still make conducting business through our first language very difficult in the EU. We will continue to campaign for equality for Irish speakers in the EU institutions and for Irish speakers dealing with these institutions.

We have also used our influence at the EU level to push the case for an Irish language Act in the Six Counties.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Continue to use Irish in our work and push the EU bodies to respect the rights of Irish speakers.

Pressure the Irish Government to meet its commitments in providing an adequate number of Irish interpreters and translators. Encourage the Irish Government to develop Irish-language courses in Gaeltacht areas specifically targeted at interpreters and translators from different language backgrounds.

Continue to work with others to ensure the provision of information to schools on careers for Irish speakers in EU institution. Empower Irish language activists in their campaigns for an Irish Language Act through facilitating delegations to meet relevant people at the EU level.

Build alliances with other indigenous and minority language rights activists from across the EU.

7. For Irish Neutrality and Global Social Justice

The EU is progressively integrating its military efforts with those of the NATO military alliance. In this process the interests of neutral countries such as Ireland are brushed aside. The Lisbon Treaty accelerates this process.

Sinn Féin believes that international relations and international justice and peace are best served by strengthening the only fully inclusive multilateral forum, the United Nations. While EU member states acting together can have a positive effect on international relations, we do not accept the existing Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) nor do we accept the legitimacy of establishing an EU Common Defence. Indeed such measures actively undermine the development of the United Nations and a more socially just international order.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:

Oppose the drive to integrate foreign and defence policy among EU Member States and to subordinate this policy to NATO, and campaign for the restoration of an independent Irish foreign policy.

Campaign for an EU Global Social Justice Agenda with an emphasis on the Millennium Development Goals, Trade Justice, and UN reform.


Argue for a progressive and peaceful policy within the EU.

Campaign for the rights of oppressed peoples and stateless nations.

Support UN-led conflict prevention, dispute mediation, peace negotiation, peace enforcement and peacekeeping operations, elections or other human rights monitoring, and post-conflict capacity building. Campaign for legally binding provisions to ensure that EU companies operating outside the EU do not violate human rights or undermine environmental sustainability. Continue to campaign against the imposition of Economic Partnership Agreements that damage developing country economies. Continue to use the European Parliament as a forum to voice opposition to the occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Israel and to call for the suspension of EU preferential trade with Israel until such time as that state fully complies with international law.

For the Language Rights of Irish Speakers

Since 2007 Irish has been an official working language of the European Union after a successful campaign by STÁDAS and other Irish language rights advocates. Whilst this development was warmly welcomed by Sinn Féin we are not content to accept the derogations and exceptions that came with it to remain in place.

To call on the EU to provide reconstruction aid to Occupied Palestine and Gaza in particular on an urgent basis, and call on the EU and its Member States to back immediate and all-inclusive negotiations leading to a durable peace settlement that will provide for two states, including a sovereign Palestinian state that is viable and sustainable.
",2009,"EP","Sinn Fein","Sinn Fein_2009_EP"
"Local 2009: Fianna Fail","INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade we have fundamentally changed the face of local Government. We gave constitutional recognition to local government, implemented an ongoing programme for local Government reform, ended the practice where governments arbitrarily delayed local elections and abolished the practice where TDs and Senators could be members of a local authority. We have put in place a wide range of legislation to improve the planning, delivery and oversight of all aspects of local government.

The work of reform and improvement must go on, but the work which has already been completed means that local authorities are far more active in coordinating and delivering high quality services than in the past.

This is a time of unprecedented economic challenges both at home and abroad. No party or candidate can campaign with credibility in this election on the basis of arbitrary promises to increase spending – local government does not work in isolation from the rest of the economy and society. However, there is still a lot which can be achieved by local authorities during the next five years. In particular, we believe that significant progress can be made in the areas of:

• Implementing, at a local level, policies which will supplement Government policy to maintain and increase employment in local communities;
• Increasing public accountability of local government;
• Improving the planning and oversight of service delivery;
• Using local planning as a foundation for recovery and job creation;
• Delivering investment in key services to continue to improve the quality of life of all our citizens;
• Realising the Government’s ambitions, at local government level, to transform all areas of the public sector as set out in the Transforming Public Services Programme.

In the period ahead, as Ireland seeks to chart a path through challenging economic times, Fianna Fáil’s local agenda is rooted in:
• Managing and improving urban development and ensuring regional coherence in planning strategies, within an overall national framework;
• Maintaining a vibrant rural Ireland in a way that protects its communities and its landscape, its built and natural heritage and the quality of our water;
• Ensuring flexibility in the management of scarce staffing and financial resources.

This manifesto addresses key issues within local authorities and also national initiatives which significantly impact of the delivery of local services.

ACCOUNTABLE AND EFFECTIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

For many years local government in Ireland operated without any credible structures for ensuring that there was effective public oversight and involvement. This has changed significantly, with the direct engagement of the public central to many key reforms. In addition, measures have been implemented in order to ensure high ethical standards.

We believe that recent improvements have confirmed the value of an ongoing reform programme and are committed to implementing further measures.

Continuing Reform

The reform process of local government must continue to ensure this country’s positive development. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reform local government to make it more transparent and more responsive to its customers. Fianna Fáil will continue to ensure that local government is responsive to an ever-changing Ireland. At local level, we believe policies must be pursued that will take account of:
• Continued population growth and balanced regional development;
• Tackling social exclusion and integrating new communities;
• Improved environmental management in areas such as waste, water quality, built and natural heritage protection, and the challenges of climate change;
• Ensuring greater connection between local government and local people;
• Maximising employment opportunities both locally and nationally.

Better local government means a better quality of life for all our people. Fianna Fáil believes in a continued focus on Quality Customer Service from Local Authorities.

Mayors

We believe that the provision of directly elected mayors has the potential to mark a further step-change - improving local government leadership, legitimacy, accountability and civic engagement. However, we also acknowledge that this move must be made on the basis of careful planning and legislation. Specifically we will:
• Support the introduction of a directly elected Mayor for Dublin to be accompanied by comprehensive legislation providing for an effective balance of responsibilities and public oversight;
• Examine proposals to provide directly elected chairs in other local authority areas;
• Ensure that as part of these reforms there will be greater accountability for the performance of mayoral functions through initiatives such as open ‘Question Time’ sessions and formal reports on both proposals and their implementation.

Other Structural Reforms
We will:
• Establish a Boundary Commission to make recommendations on the most appropriate local governance structures and/or boundaries for the regional Gateway towns and cities;
• Review the balance of power between the elected member and the manager;
• Ensure chairs of each local authority’s Strategic Policy Committees are elected for the full term of the council to ensure continuity of policy over the full term of a Council.

Financing Local Government

Fianna Fáil made the first significant move to give local authorities a local source of funding with the establishment of the Local Government Fund. The introduction of a transparent Development Levy system helped raise funding for the provision of water, sewerage, roads and community facilities. However these moves, welcome as they were, did not solve the perennial question of the need for distinct funding of local government. In difficult economic times, this question is all the more relevant.

The Commission on Taxation is examining options for the future financing of local government. It is a highly complex matter. The Commission has undertaken a consultation with the relevant parties. Fianna Fáil will move the process forward quickly following the publication of the Commission’s recommendations. Any change in the funding arrangements must be based on the principles of:
• Equity;
• Accountability;
• Sustainability.

In the present economic difficulties we believe that Local Government can play a significant part in ensuring the principle aim of Government - protecting and maintaining jobs - is achieved. For this reason, Fianna Fáil makes the following commitments:

Business Rates

On councils where Fianna Fáil have a controlling majority we will “freeze” rates for the first three years. In addition, we will support a comprehensive review of these rates to be carried out jointly by Enterprise Ireland and representatives of local government and with a wide consultation process.

Development Levies

Development levies are an important part of ensuring that public services are available when major developments occur. There is evidence that in the current economic climate they are acting as a disincentive to the progression of many projects from single houses to major developments. At a time when it is important to try to maintain and increase employment by stimulating economic activity, Fianna Fáil will cut all development levy charges by 50% for a two year period for all projects through the planning system and those which have been substantially completed in that 2 year period.

We will ensure that tax and rate payers do not have to pay a disproportionate amount for the provision of extended services by providing a payback to the local authorities through the Local Government Fund.

Local Authorities and Employment

Local authorities cannot by themselves deliver recovery and job creation but they can potentially play an important role. We are committed to ensuring that each local authority immediately prepares a strategy for how it can, through its procedures and programmes, assist in the retention and creation of employment.

County and City Enterprise Boards

Many Irish small and medium enterprises have the potential, with the right supports, to grow and become even more significant individual employers in their own right.

For new and micro-enterprises, our City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) play a pivotal role in each city and county in bringing business ideas to life that result in local job creation. Fianna Fáil will:
• continue to support sustainable growth-orientated local micro-enterprises through the CEBs to deliver high quality job creation;
• increase the provision of repayable finance or quasi-loan facilities available to local micro-enterprises through the CEBs;
• upgrade the CEBs’ grant offerings with new grants for local enterprise consisting of priming grants, business expansion/development grants and feasibility/innovation grants;
• promote and support relevant business and professional training for voluntary agencies, as significant local employers, through the CEBs.

Supporting Local Enterprise through National Agencies

For established enterprises, the work of Enterprise Ireland is vital to growing our indigenous base of exporting companies, achieving export-led recovery and growth for our economy and, as a result, sustaining and creating new jobs at home. At a local level, Fianna Fáil will:
• Ensure that the national enterprise agencies work closely with the CEBs;
• Support local indigenous companies, and the jobs they provide, through the current global downturn by the provision of a €100m Enterprise Stabilisation Fund;
• Prioritise capital investment for the development of Community Enterprise Centres to provide the local infrastructure necessary for businesses to grow throughout the regions;
• Expand the role of Innovation Vouchers in allowing growing local enterprises bridge the innovation gap in getting their product or service to market.


Local and Rural Enterprise

We will ensure through the new streamlined local development structures that cover all parts of the country since 2008 that the €1billion of state, European Union and private funding under the Rural Development Programme will create 12,000 jobs in locally-based rural enterprise between now and 2013.


FDI for all Regions

Attracting foreign direct investment will continue to play a pivotal role in Fianna Fáil’s strategy for job creation throughout the country. The creation of “clusters” has proved successful in attracting investment to various hubs throughout the country. Fianna Fáil is committed to ensuring that all regions benefit to the greatest extent possible from foreign direct investment. Within the last year, we have given a policy direction to IDA Ireland in pursuit of this aim. Fianna Fáil will now designate specific funding for the promotion of those counties that have not benefited from a foreign direct investment creating in excess of 150 jobs in the past five years.


Business Interaction with Local Authorities

Fianna Fáil is committed to ensuring that local businesses’ interaction with their local authorities is a positive experience. To that end, Fianna Fáil will:
• Proceed with the establishment of Business Support Units to act as a point of contact within each local authority to ensure a quick and co-ordinated response to business needs within each local authority; 
• Establish a high level working group to, in conjunction with local authority managers, identify ways to improve the enterprise and business support environment in each local authority area.

Local Training and Support for Jobseekers

Fianna Fáil has more than doubled, to 92,000, the number of local short-term training places available for jobseekers that need to re-skill or up-skill in 2009. Nationally, some 128,000 training and activation places have been provided for in 2009, resulting in a significant range of options for jobseekers in each community. Fianna Fáil remains committed to supporting Community Employment Schemes as an essential activation measure that also provides a significant benefit to local communities. To assist jobseekers further, Fianna Fáil will:
• review provision for and the structure of the Community Employment programme to ensure it meets current needs;
• ensure best value and return for our investment in training programmes in each region, reflecting the skills need of local and growing enterprises;
• provide places in local authorities for participants on the new Work Experience Scheme to ensure that each town, city or county area can benefit from the skills of participants as they gain valuable work experience;
• undertake an early evaluation of the pilot training programme aimed at sustaining vulnerable employment and if evaluation is positive organise expansion across the country.


Improved Delivery of Local Services

Fianna Fáil believes that one of the main challenges facing local government is to continue to improve performance and customer service. Real progress has been made in the area of efficiencies and value for money in Local Government, as acknowledged in the Indecon Review of Local Government Financing, and we now have to bring this progress to the next stage.

Fianna Fáil will pursue policies that deliver efficiencies and flexibility, encourage the sharing of resources between authorities where appropriate and ensure the recruitment of staff to match the requirements of local government.

We will:
• Drive efficiency in Local Government building on recent improvements in financial management systems and service indicators;
• Insist on an efficiency dividend, the proceeds of which will be ring-fenced for labour intensive capital projects or enterprise supports;
• Introduce further performance benchmarks across the system and reward top performing Local Authorities financially;
• Ensure the issue of increasing shared services is pursued in co-operation with other local authorities and public bodies;
• Work with voluntary disability organisations to improve access to services and facilities, including services for older people;
• Disability-proof services and facilities provided by each Local Authority or their contractors;
• Ensure Service Indicators are consistently evaluated and updated.

We also believe there is greater potential for the best performing local authorities to share experience and for good performance to be better communicated to the public. Better showcasing through awards can also highlight best performance.


Better Use of ICT

Fianna Fáil will continue to promote the innovative use of ICT in driving improved local services, and maximising existing resource use, over the coming years.
• In addition, we believe that all local authorities should review the level and timeliness of information provision online and adopt new formal targets for improvement in this area;
• The plenary sessions of all county or city councils should be made available by live-stream together with the detailed agenda and documents before the council.

Customer Charters

Fianna Fáil is committed to developing a Local Authority Customer Service Charter. This Charter will be informed by recent evaluations of Customer Service Charters within the Civil Service.


Ethics

A wide range of legislation introduced during the last decade has brought in a completely new framework for ethics within local government – something which has directly dealt with the worst actions of previous times. While local authorities should still take charge of ensuring compliance with all ethical requirements, a greater oversight role can still be played by the Standards in Public Office Commission.
• While the recently introduced local electoral expenditure limits are necessary, we will ensure that their operation is reviewed to ensure that the bureaucracy involved is appropriate and is not unduly burdensome on candidates, especially those who do not have access to extensive technical support.
• Within Fianna Fáil, we will increase advice services and formal regulations to ensure the highest level of compliance with legislative requirements and the guidelines of the Standards in Public Office Commission for all councillors and candidates.

Getting the Best for the Community from Public Services and Public Funding

Fianna Fáil believes that all services must be paid for, either through taxation or direct charges and the public should be told this. Those who tell the public that they can have a whole plethora of extra services with no charges or taxes to pay for them are being misleading. We will continue to work smartly to get the best value for communities from the programmes and schemes we are funding.


Rural Development and Planning

We believe that planning and development procedures must enable rural communities to thrive. We introduced the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines in 2005 to get a balance in protecting those areas under pressure from overdevelopment through urban-generated housing and facilitating new homes in rural areas that have a local housing need or that have suffered population decline and fragmentation. At Government level we will establish a National Monitoring Committee on rural planning to ensure sustainable rural planning for living and for working.


An Ghaeltacht

We will continue to work at local and national level to ensure that local authorities fulfil their obligation to protect the unique linguistic identity of the Gaeltacht including promoting Irish as the community language.


Transport

A proper transport system is an essential element of any measurement of the quality of life of our citizens. Great progress has been made in improving our transport system all over Ireland with improved roads and public transport facilities. We will complete our motorway system next year. The level and standard of our bus and rail services has improved beyond recognition. Fianna Fáil remains committed to continued improvements in the years ahead.


Rural Transport

Fianna Fáil introduced the Rural Transport Initiative and maintained an €11 million investment this year. We remain committed to improving the service in the years ahead.

We are exploring the option of providing a full scale transport system in rural areas using the network expertise of Bus Éireann, the physical infrastructure and personnel resources of the school transport system and the financial resources currently being spent on transport by the HSE and the Department of Education and Science. Local Authorities will have a central role in any new system that may emerge.

Roads

Fianna Fáil has overseen a massive increase in investment in local roads in recent years.

Our priority is to:
• Cut travelling times;
• Protect the environment;
• Improve safety;
• Reduce congestion.

Under Fianna Fáil:

Driving conditions have been transformed across large parts of the non-national road network. Thousands of kilometres of non-national roads which were considered deficient have been restored to good condition. This year, on average, Government will spend almost €6,000 per km through its non-national road investment programme.

Fianna Fáil will:
• Maintain a high level of spending on local roads over the next 5 years;
• Continue the investment in local roads to service new housing, industrial and commercial development;
• Open up areas for tourism development by improving road access in rural areas;
• Complete our investment programme to ensure that non-national roads are properly signposted;
• Allocate a portion of the budget on road improvement projects to the provision of new footpaths to allow pedestrians to walk in greater safety and comfort;
• Implement the “Smarter Travel” Policy in full consultation and cooperation with Local Authorities;
• Vigorously pursue the implementation of the recently published “Cycle Framework Policy” with the assistance of the Local Authorities.


In 2009, work will continue on a total of 18 major national road projects, all of which are proceeding on time and on budget. A total of six major national road projects are due to be completed in 2009.

The National Road Authority (NRA) is on target to ensure the completion of all five major inter-urban routes linking Dublin to Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and the Border by 2010 as expected.

This will reduce travelling times between all parts of the country and increase the international competitiveness of all our regions.

Following the completion of the motorway programme we will prioritise national road investment in national secondary routes nationwide.

Fianna Fáil will:
• Continue to work to ensure the completion of essential road infrastructure, including by-passes and inter-urban routes, designed to relieve congestion and ensure the future growth of the Irish economy, the provision of jobs and the future prosperity and well being of the whole country.


Road Safety

Safety on our roads is an every day matter of life and death. Our campaign to make all our roads safer has clearly had a very positive impact.

2008 saw the lowest number of road deaths in this country since records began.

Since 1997 government has implemented robust national road safety strategies and this work is saving lives. In 1972, 640 people were tragically killed on our roads. In 2008 this figure fell to 278 deaths despite the fact that there are now over eight times the number of licensed vehicles and licence holders in the state.

At the very core of making our roads safer is driver responsibility. The introduction of penalty points has made drivers more careful and saved lives. The new provisional licence stipulations introduced in mid 2008 have also delivered a direct and immediate impact on lowering road deaths.

Fianna Fáil will:
• Continue to roll out the many life saving measures contained in the National Roads Safety Strategy (2007-2012);
• Extend the network of speed cameras nationwide at accident black spots and dangerous stretches of road to ensure maximum effectiveness in reducing deaths and injuries on our roads;
• Deliver a register of existing driving instructors and put in place a suitable monitoring mechanism to maintain a high standard.

Tourism

We believe that smaller-scale local provision of tourist facilities can play a major role in the local economy and are committed to market, invest and promote local tourism and the further engagement of local planning structures with this sector.

Local Development

We will focus on creating sustainable communities by incorporating the highest design standards and providing a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of essential infrastructure and services. We will facilitate the development of sustainable communities through more effective planning and the provision of necessary supporting services and amenities:
• We will help achieve the most efficient use of urban land through housing densities that are appropriate to the location involved and availability of supporting services and infrastructure, particularly transport;
• We will set high standards in terms of space and facilities to meet the needs of communities in line with best urban regeneration practice;
• We will endeavour to ensure new residential developments be supported and facilitated by the necessary supporting services and infrastructure. Crucial infrastructure such as education and health facilities, public transport, child-care and community amenities must be set as equally important as the usual hard infrastructure needed like water services and road access;
• We will insist that Development plans, urban local area plans and planning schemes for Strategic Development Zones should underpin the creation of sustainable residential developments;
• We will insist Development plans should include urban design policies which are capable of being expanded in more detail in local area plans;
• We will ensure local authorities should issue design briefs and receive design statements for particularly important, sensitive or large-scale development sites;
• We will insist no substantial residential development should proceed without an assessment of existing schools capacity or the provision of new school facilities in tandem with the development;
• We will insist no substantial residential development should proceed without either adequate existing public transport provision or new public transport provided in tandem with the development;
• We will insist all new developments should prioritise public transport, cycling and walking, and minimise the need to use cars;
• We will pass by-laws to ensure that all new buildings meet best practice for disability access;
• We will work with all relevant stakeholders to address outstanding access issues;
• We will encourage more efficient use of energy and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.


Housing

Housing funding has increased significantly in recent years and a major programme of social housing remains underway. The effective use of this investment will remain a major issue for local authorities in the next five years:
• We will restore balance to the housing market by matching up social housing needs with suitable available unsold housing units;
• We will further expand the sources of social housing supply through the introduction of long term leasing arrangements;
• We will support an ambitious programme to improve energy performance in local authority housing stock;
• Fianna Fáil is committed to providing appropriate Traveller accommodation. We will also improve services to Travellers where the rate of progress so far has been unsatisfactory;
• We will continue to promote the Home Choice loan as a practical and prudent temporary house purchase loan scheme; its potential beneficiaries are households which, in the current economic climate, are unable to obtain sufficient loan finance elsewhere to purchase their homes (and which are required to prove their eligibility with evidence of their inability);
• We will continue to provide funding for the carrying out of essential repairs to houses occupied by elderly persons living on their own under the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme;
• We will continue to adequately resource the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme for voluntary housing;
• We will seek to maintain progress towards medium term housing commitments set out under Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan through flexible and imaginative responses to the structuring of our investment programme to maximise the return on public investment;
• We will pursue the use of long term lease arrangements for social housing purposes to supplement traditional local authority construction or acquisition over the coming months;
• We will promote the new single streamlined Government Equity to replace the current approach through which affordable housing is made available under Part V, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative;
• We will review and promote all disability related housing information;
• We will introduce greater equity into the affordable housing system and provide a basis for achieving greater consistency across the schemes and across different areas of the country;
• We will ensure an adequate supply of affordable social and supported housing suited to the broad diversity of needs of people with disabilities.


Homelessness

In cooperation with government departments, the level, range and quality of provision for people who are homeless has improved significantly in recent years.
• We will seek to provide effective long-term solutions for people leaving homelessness, including development of a new scheme of supports and homes through leasing or equivalent accommodation supply arrangements;
• We will seek support for new arrangements and procedures for funding homeless services based on needs, priorities and maximising efficiency, quality and value for money;
• We will work for co-ordination of guidance to local authorities, local homeless fora and health services, particularly in the context of formulation of local homeless action plans.

Water and Waste Water Services

We will continue to ensure priority is attached to investment in water services even in these adverse economic times. We will continue to preserve and protect our water resources as a key priority in environmental policy by vigorously pursuing our programme to meet European Union standards for drinking water.
• We will ensure all local authorities work with the key stakeholders, including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the EPA and the EU Commission to ensure that the management structures for the supply of drinking water in Ireland are of the highest standard;
• We will support the EPA’s recommendation that chlorine monitors and alarms be installed on drinking water supplies;
• We will stress the positive benefits for water suppliers in promoting water conservation and we will ensure that increased focus will be placed on conservation measures in the new Water Services Investment Programme.

Waste Management
• We will continue to ensure adequate funding is made available to Local Authorities towards the continuing development of Ireland’s waste recycling infrastructure;
• We will work to ensure each Local Authorities waste management infrastructure and practices reach the highest EU standards;
• We will expand the network of bottle banks, recycling centres and segregated collection and introduce household hazardous waste collection in all suitable recycling centres;
• We will ensure that landfills currently provided for under regional waste management plans should be the last to be constructed for a generation;
• We will seek to drive down the cost of waste management charges to householders and business by ensuring that waste management systems are competitive and use all available technologies to achieve this including the use of waste for generating sustainable electricity;
• We will support community monitoring arrangements of major waste management facilities, including on-line monitoring where appropriate, with specific powers/rights to information;
• We will ensure that flat rates on waste disposal will be abolished and a mandatory system of weight-related charges for waste collection introduced.

RAPID – Disadvantaged Urban Communities

The RAPID Programme is giving local communities in the most disadvantaged urban areas a real voice for change for the better in their own communities. We will ensure that all severely disadvantaged areas that should have RAPID status will be included in the RAPID Programme.


CLÁR - Disadvantaged Rural Communities

Since the start of 2004 some €100million has been provided for local social and physical infrastructure in the CLÁR areas and this has leveraged out almost the same figure in matching funds. In these times of economic constraint, we will focus the CLÁR programme on priority local needs in CLÁR areas.


Litter

Fianna Fáil will continue to resource and implement anti-litter action at local level. We will:
• Step up enforcement of existing legislation on litter, illegal dumping and pollution;
• Encourage greater training for, and greater flexibility in, the litter warden service, including greater targeting of resources at the most serious litter problems;
• Promote greater litter education/awareness in schools;
• Require particular sectors associated with litter polluting products (chewing gum, takeaway foods, drinks containers) to give clear commitments to anti-litter action;
• Promote the Irish Business Against Litter’s initiative, the Anti Litter League, which ranks the performance of each local authority in combating litter in a league table format.

Libraries

We will continue to support the development and refurbishment of Public Libraries throughout the country. The last decade has seen a significant increase in the funding for the Library Service. As a result of policies of Fianna Fáil led Government we have more and better library services and buildings than ever, longer opening hours and more services available to the public. Libraries have the potential to become the focus of information provision for jobseekers, employers, users of public services, tourists and many others. Fianna Fáil will seek to realise that potential.

Joint Policing Committees

We will complete the roll-out of the Joint Policing Committees to all local authority areas. These Committees give community leaders, Gardaí and citizens an opportunity to address the crime problems in their communities together.

Apartments

We will shortly introduced legislation to regulate property management companies.

Recreation and Amenities

Local Authorities play a key role as providers of recreation and amenity facilities. The National Lottery and the development levies have helped to provide many facilities in recent years. Planning rules ensuring that crèche/childcare facilities have to be provided in certain new developments has also helped but we must continue to build on this progress.

Fianna Fáil will ensure:

• All developments will include provision for a “community gain” for new and existing residents; 
• Provision of scheme to increase the numbers of playgrounds in existing developments and to ensure the provision of a playground as a planning condition of future developments above a certain size;
• Provision of safe walking and cycling routes to schools and local shopping in all new developments;
• Introduce changes in planning law to ensure that a builder cannot apply for planning permission to build extra houses on “green areas” in existing estates after a period of years.",2009,"Local","Fianna Fail","Fianna Fail_2009_Local"
"Local 2009: Fine Gael","Guaranteed Change

Fine Gael believes that Ireland can return to growth and prosperity if we have the courage and vision to change the way we run our economy and govern our country.

Ireland is facing its worst economic crisis since the foundation of the State. By Christmas, at least 500,000 people will be out of work. Across the country, anxious families are looking to Government for answers, for a sense that it has a plan to get things moving again. So far, the Fianna Fáil Government’s only answer has been to make ordinary people pay the price for its many failures.

Above all Ireland needs a Government that is not afraid of new ideas, and is willing to embrace radical change. Fine Gael can and does embrace change. We are not offering instant, easy solutions to Ireland’s many problems. But we do have a bold, ambitious plan, which will also strengthen local democracy, to get Ireland growing again.

Fine Gael’s plan for Ireland is built around three elements:
1. A New Approach to Government
2. A Greener, Smarter Economy, and
3. A Fairer Ireland

A New Approach to Government

Over the last ten years, the Government has thrown money at every problem in the public sector, without making any real change to the way the system works. Billions are wasted, even as services for the most vulnerable are cut, and taxpayers are hammered by additional charges and levies.

Fine Gael’s approach is very different. We know that no country has ever taxed itself out of recession. Instead, a Fine Gael Government will slash the costs of running the State, and introduce wide-ranging reforms to make the State both more efficient and accountable, particularly at local level:
• Fine Gael will cut the cost of running the State. We will fundamentally change the way Government works, by greatly increasing transparency and introducing incentives across the public sector to encourage greater efficiency.
• Fine Gael will strengthen Local Government, making it more efficient and accountable to local people and communities. 95 State bodies will be merged or abolished, saving millions of Euros for taxpayers every year.
• Fine Gael “NewERA” programme will transform Ireland’s Semi-State sector. We will sell State companies that no longer perform a strategic role for the State, and reform and recapitalise the remaining companies, as part of a massive investment programme in a greener, smarter economy.

A Greener, Smarter Economy

The global economy is entering a third “green” industrial revolution, where the winners will be those countries that move quickly and effectively to low carbon economies, powered by clean energy. While the Government has talked a great deal about the Green Economy, real progress has been limited, and the various targets it has adopted for Renewable Energy are too cautious. Fine Gael believes that decisive action needs to be taken now. Fine Gael has developed an €11 billion strategy to rebuild our economy into a low carbon but highly competitive economy that will attract more sustainable jobs in years to come. Realising this vision for a greener, smarter economy will have the added benefit of creating 100,000 jobs over the next four years.

Fine Gael recognises that, in addition to creating new jobs in the Green Economy, it is vital that as many existing jobs as possible be protected in small businesses. For this reason Fine Gael has also published a series of proposals to support Ireland’s SME sector, including a reduction in VAT rates; A freezing of Local Authority Rates; A

Loan Guarantee Scheme and a reduction in energy prices. A detailed SME Survival Package will be launched by Fine Gael during our election campaign.

A Fairer Ireland

One of the great failures of the Government over the last ten years has been its inability to create a society that is fair and just. All too often, the education you get and the healthcare you receive depends on how much money you earn. Fine Gael completely rejects the idea that society should be divided between the “haves” and the “have-nots”. In any Republic worth its name, all citizens must be treated equally.

Fine Gael’s new plan for Ireland’s healthcare system, FairCare, will slash waiting lists by imposing rigorous targets on hospitals and by building up a credible primary care system that can keep people out of hospital. By the end of its first term in Government, Fine Gael will introduce the Dutch model of Universal Health Insurance, which will ensure that everyone has health insurance and a free package of GP care.

Fine Gael’s policy on third level education rules out the return of third level fees. In order to make up the funding gap that exists in third level, graduates should contribute to the cost of their courses after they graduate for a set period of time. When fully up and running this system will raise up to €500m per annum – which will be used directly to make our third level sector better and stronger. This graduate contribution will enable us to abolish registration fees.

Local Elections

These Local Elections present an opportunity for the Irish people to signal their strong desire for change. Fine Gael over the past few months has demonstrated its vision of a new, fairer Ireland. No more will we accept more of the same that has brought our country to its knees. On June 5th a vote Fine Gael is a guarantee of change.

Local Government should be at the heart of our democratic system. It is the system of Government that should be responsive to the needs of our people in every sense. Like every aspect of Government, reform and change is required to ensure greater accountability for taxpayer’s money and 21st Century services.

Local authorities are at the heart of our local economy and Fine Gael will support policies that will enhance the prospects of local employment. We want to give power back to the people through their local elected representatives.

Fine Gael plans to reform local Government in line with three main principles:
1. Fixing the democratic deficit at local level by removing the centralised top down approach to delivery and responsibility of local services.
2. Using the strengths of local authorities to create employment.
3. Making local Government more relevant to the every day lives of our citizens.

Fine Gael has examined the various agencies and programmes that are funded at local level. We believe that many of those organisations should have their budget and structures accountable to the local authority system. This will ensure a more cohesive approach to create employment. The consolidation of agencies will result in financial savings and help put an end to unnecessary duplication of services. I strongly believe we need to restore trust, services and responsibility to local Government.

June 5th is an opportunity for the people to give power back to communities by voting for the Fine Gael candidates who will deliver real change.

1. Creating Jobs – Getting Ireland Back to Work

Background

Ireland is in the midst of an unemployment crisis. More than one out of every five workers now relies on support from the State to survive and many more are expected to join them on the dole queues as the year goes on. Yes, international influences have caused some job losses but the extent of our current crisis is directly relating to the handling of the Irish economy in recent years. Worryingly, the Government has not produced a single coherent plan to create new jobs when introducing emergency budgets to raise taxes on families. In fact since Brian Cowen became Taoiseach an additional 171,000 people have lost their jobs.

Fine Gael firmly believes that Ireland needs to start over again in order to lay the foundations for future economic and employment growth. Fine Gael did it before and we must do it again. We must rebuild Ireland into a modern, efficient, and competitive economy that can attract world class jobs while allowing our own businesses to survive and thrive.

Fine Gael has this plan: The Rebuilding Ireland Strategy

Fine Gael’s Rebuilding Ireland Strategy will:
1. Lay the foundations for future long term economic and employment growth by investing in key infrastructure, such as communications and energy, which will make the Irish economy one of the most competitive in Europe again.
2. Provide immediate jobs in the planning, construction and operation of these key infrastructure projects. Fine Gael estimates 100,000 new jobs can be created over the period 2010 – 2013.

How will Rebuilding Ireland work?

The plan involves an €11bn stimulus plan to kick-start the Irish economy through investment in badly needed new infrastructure. This is managed through a management structure for new and existing State companies that will be responsible for delivering a targeted series of large scale investments.

We propose that the ownership of a wide range of existing and new State companies involved in energy, transport and communications will drive new investment. Among the existing state companies that will be moved under a new management structure will be the ESB, Eirgrid, An Post, Bord Gais, Bord na Mona, Coillte and the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANS). The new commercial state companies will include:

Smart Grid (ESB Networks restructured and split off from the ESB Group) that will invest an additional €3.3 billion between 2010 and 2013 to develop a 21st century ""smart grid""; Broadband 21, to invest an additional €2.5 billion in amalgamating and building out the diverse telecom assets of existing State companies; BioEnergy Ireland will merge together Bord na Mona and Coillte to invest €800 million in 2010-13 to become a global leader in the commercialisation of next generation bio-energy technologies; Renewable Energy Ireland which will invest in early stage green energy companies and applied renewable energy research, with a particular focus on technologies that can be licensed; Irish Water will take overall responsibility for providing safe, clean drinking water and treating waste water through an expanded water infrastructure investment programme; Greener Home Bank will help tens of thousands of home owners across the country upgrade their homes to challenging new energy and waste water standards.

Fine Gael plans to swap old State assets for new State assets

Our plan can be accomplished without adding to runaway Government borrowing. It will be funded through charges on consumers and businesses for the use of new technologies and network infrastructures. The additional €11bn in investments will be funded from a combination of sources such as a draw down of National Pension Reserve Fund and additional forms of borrowing. The NPRF will be replenished from the sale of existing State assets that are judged to no longer serve the strategic goals of a new modern economy. It is important to note that the Fine Gael plan does not impose any greater borrower requirements on the exchequer.

2. Supporting our Businesses
Fine Gael recognises the need to not only create new jobs but that the State should be doing everything in its power to try and protect existing jobs and businesses. Small and medium sized enterprises are the lifeblood of the economy and account for a staggering 97% of companies in Ireland. Between them they employ over 800,000 people in every part of the country. Instead of working hard to support these businesses the Government is crippling them with high utility costs such as electricity, gas and waste.

Most towns and villages in Ireland are almost totally reliant on the survival of these businesses to provide local employment. Fine Gael will place the survival of these businesses at the heart of Government and Local Government policy.

Fine Gael will:
Freeze business rates for the next five years on Fine Gael controlled local authorities This action will provide for financial certainty in business planning during these tough times. Any increase in local business taxes could make the economic and employment situation worse.

Introduce a Government-backed loan guarantee for viable small & medium enterprises to provide working capital and help them sustain employment This scheme could be funded through the National Treasury Management Agency and operated through the commercial banks. This way, the Government could help viable small & medium enterprises to stay afloat during the recession.

Cut both rates of VAT As Fine Gael proposed in our alternative budget we would temporarily cut the lower rate of VAT 10% until 2011 and cut the standard rate of VAT back to 21%. This would boost economic confidence and activity in the Republic.

Fine Gael will publish a detailed SME Survival Package during our election campaign.

3. Reforming Local Government – Business & Employment
Local Government is in limbo in Ireland, if not in crisis. Since independence Local Government has suffered from an identity crisis as it lacked a strong primary mission. As a result there is a strong disconnect between local authorities, councillors and their respective communities. Local authorities have been constantly sidelined when it comes to providing new services on a local level with central Government either providing services directly or devolving powers to an agency or ‘quango’.

Fine Gael will develop a one stop shop for local business support based in Local Government.

Countless new agencies have been set up in recent years that all compete to provide business support, training services and grants to indigenous business. Fine Gael will put a new focus on Local Government to become a ‘one stop shop’ for the development and support of local businesses and workers which will revolutionise business support in Ireland. The consolidation of the many agencies involved in Local Government will result in millions of taxpayer’s money being saved by ceasing unnecessary duplication of services. In addition, having all these business and

employment services under one roof can greatly benefit business support as all these new services can tap into each other’s knowledge base, experience and resources.

Further details on Fine Gael’s extensive plans to reform Local Government can be found in its ‘Power to the People’ reform policy document online at www.finegael.ie

4. Fixing the Banks
Fine Gael will create a ‘National Recovery Bank’ and abandon the Government’s €90 billion gamble

Fixing the banking system is in the absolute best interest of every community in Ireland. It would allow credit to flow once again to families and small businesses, some of which are in dire need of credit to make it through these tough times.

But, Fine Gael is totally against the plan put forward by Government to create a new agency to take all the bad property debt from reckless banks. In Fine Gael’s view this is nothing more than a bail out of reckless bankers by taking a massive €90 billion gamble using taxpayer’s money. Future generations of Irish citizens could end up paying the price if this gamble goes wrong. Fine Gael is also of the opinion that nationalisation does not solve the banking crisis and will leave the Irish taxpayer unacceptably exposed to picking up the tab of toxic assets.

Fine Gael has recently suggested a totally new and radical approach to fixing our banking sector. Based on the idea of creating a “National Recovery Bank” with a clean balance sheet and the capacity to lend, it could be set up very quickly.

This would leave the bad property-related debts with legacy bad banks, with the shareholders and other professional investors in debentures and bonds to absorb the losses. They took the risks. They earned the higher returns in the good years. They should pick up the tab. Fine Gael believes that this alternative model deserves serious assessment and could offer a much better use of scarce taxpayers' resources.

5. Better Planning
Bad planning is a blight on Irish society. It can lead to increased crime and anti-social behaviour, reduced quality family time, and it suffocates business.

The transport needs of local communities have been ignored for far too long as new estates, developments and roads were built without any concern for the public transport needs of the people. Communities have suffered poor transport links as a result and families have been put under unnecessary pressure as parents spend ever more time commuting. This intolerable situation cannot continue and immediate changes are needed in planning laws to address transport deficits.

Fine Gael will ensure local transport plans will be an integral part of Development Plans

Fine Gael proposes to amend planning laws to ensure all local authorities develop a transport plan in conjunction with their County/City Development Plans and Local Areas Plans. A transport plan must make provision for transport infrastructure and state clearly how local communities can access public transport.

We will introduce new guidelines for urban and village centres

Fine Gael will introduce new urban and village guidelines to renew and rediscover the concept of having a genuine public space as the nucleus of any neighbourhood. Fine Gael believes that the local community would be better served with a shared public space at the centre of any urban area that encourages greater interaction between people. Most modern squares do include a retail element but retail should not be the primary reason for the existence of a shared public space. Fine Gael in Government and Local Government will consult with the relevant stakeholders and with communities themselves to draw up new guidelines along these lines.

Make Strategic Development Zones the norm for large developments

The creation of Strategic Development Zones (SDZ) is a relatively new planning process used in urban areas. The development of a SDZ has learned from Ireland’s history of bad planning. The SDZ model plans for the provision of public transport, roads, community facilities, schools as well as housing. The success of Adamstown in South County Dublin has proven the model can work. Fine Gael would like to see the SDZ model used for all new developments of 2,000 housing units or more instead of the old Local Area Plan system.

New rules to tackle unfinished estates and developers in breach of planning permission

The recent construction boom saw development at a rapid pace. Local Authorities lacked teeth to force developers to finish developments and new estates to the exact specifications of the original plan. There are countless examples around the country where developers left a site early leaving it unfinished. In the end it is the new homeowner who suffers. Fine Gael would introduction new legislation to allow Councils to impose large fines on developers who breach their planning permission in such ways.

Fine Gael will reform and enhance An Bord Pleanala

The demand on the national planning appeals board has increased dramatically in recent years and has placed An Bord Pleanála under severe pressure. Since 2008 there has been a continued deterioration in appeal disposals. Fine Gael will introduce an 18 week statutory period for dealing with cases referred to An Bord Pleanala (with the exception of where an oral hearing is required). Fine Gael would reallocate excess planners from some Local Authorities to An Bord Pleanala in order to process the backlog of planning appeals.

Fine Gael will extend planning permission deadlines

The reduction in disposable income in most families caused by increased Government taxes and charges coupled with a reduction in wages has meant that many small building projects have been put on hold until their economic outlook is more stable. As a result Fine Gael proposes to extend all 5 year planning permissions to 7 years.

6. Climate Change & the Environment

Fine Gael will transform the Irish economy into a low carbon economy

Fine Gael’s ‘Rebuilding Ireland’ NewERA strategy details how we would have unprecedented investment in renewable energy projects, energy storage, next generation communications and lay the structures for the electrification of the car transport network.

A radical transformation of the Irish economy that will dramatically reduce emissions from the energy and transport sectors is needed if we are to meet our challenging Kyoto and EU emissions reduction targets. Ireland currently imports over €6.5 billion worth of fossil fuels every year to feed our cars, homes and electricity grid. This is neither economically nor environmentally sustainable.

Over 42% of all of Ireland's carbon emissions comes from energy industries and the transport sector. These also continue to be the hardest sectors in which to reduce emissions. Fine Gael’s strategy to create new renewable energy companies will drive serious investment in emerging technologies such as ocean energy and develop market share in developing technology such as wind. New energy storage projects will play a much bigger role in renewable energy generation.

Fine Gael will use Local Government to create a more sustainable Ireland

Local Government has its role to play in climate change along with the rest of us. In fact, a number of its activities could significantly reduce carbon emissions across a number of sectors once a proper strategy is adopted.

Climate change reforms required for planning can be divided into three separate areas.
• Buildings: The vast majority of Ireland’s current housing stock was constructed at a time when issues such as insulation and energy efficiency were not highly regarded. It will require a massive effort to retrofit these houses. In this regard local authorities must ensure that all future buildings and major extensions approved for construction meet the highest standards in building design and construction.
• Pedestrian & cycle friendly urban designs: the dominance of the private car has meant that we use our cars for ever shorter journeys. The 2006 census confirmed that over 44,000 primary school children were driven less than 1 km to school. Local Authorities when drafting LAPs and SDZs need to include smarter plans to improve accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists. This doesn’t necessarily mean more laneways but smarter layouts of roads and footpaths. Long continuous roads only encourage people to drive relatively short distances as the crow flies.
• Renewable energy planning guidelines: Local Government needs to develop new procedures to expedite planning applications for renewable energy installations on single houses. Central Government and local authorities need to work together to develop new procedures and guidelines dealing with large planning applications by large energy companies for new sizable facilities such as pump storage, hydro, wind, and wave power generation plants.

7. Reducing Waste – Improving Water

FG would end Council dual regulatory and service provider functions

Fine Gael is proposing that Local Government should regulate competition in their waste market as opposed to being a competitor. Each Local Authority should seek out private operators and put to tender a number of waste routes of both profitable and PSO supported routes.

Fine Gael would centralise a new waste waiver scheme in social welfare

The different policies adopted by the Councils in relation to a waiver scheme for low income families is causing a lot of upset among those left without. A new waiver scheme should be considered in the context of social welfare instead of ad hoc policies being implemented in different localities.

Fine Gael will develop a single National Waste Strategy and incorporate regional waste plans

Each Local Authority is required to develop waste management plans for the prevention, minimisation, collection, recovery and disposal of waste. They are also empowered to prepare joint plans, but more needs to be done to better co-ordinate the waste plans of Local Government. Fine Gael believes there needs to be a serious effort by Government to co-ordinate regional waste management plans to attract investment in waste infrastructure in a way that maximises potential economies of scale, competition and enables the market to pass on the benefits to businesses and households.

Water Services

Recent water crises in Ireland have highlighted just how precious this important resource is. Recent EPA investigations show many of our ground water supplies are contaminated with human or animal effluent. Drinking water crises along the west coast in recent years have again highlighted the constant challenge to protect drinking water supplies.

Septic tanks need to be improved and certified

There are possibly hundreds of thousands of leaking, poorly equipped and badly installed septic tanks in Ireland today. The consequences of this are obvious and our ground water supplies are heavily polluted as a result. Poor enforcement of building standards and guidelines has meant that the problem has become a significant one with no quick or cheap solutions. However, Ireland must meet EU water standards as set down in the Water Framework Directive and to do this we must address septic tanks.

Fine Gael will introduce new regulations which will compel homeowners to upgrade and fix their septic tanks to meet basic standards before they are allowed to sell their properties. Similar to the recently introduced BER rating, all houses must have a properly functioning septic tank, certified by the Local Authority, before being allowed to be sold. Fine Gael will also examine a grant scheme to meet part of the costs in upgrading these tanks as part of future job creation and green strategies.

A new national Irish Water company will have responsibility for new investment in water infrastructure.

As described in Fine Gael’s March 2009 Job Creation Strategy, Rebuilding Ireland, we would set up a new semi State company called ‘Irish Water’ to take over responsibility for investment in new water infrastructure. This will ensure access to secure and safe water supplies which is core to sustainable national economic recovery and the development of key growth centres in Ireland over the next decade.

8. Creating a FairCare Health System

Fine Gael will implement ‘FairCare’, our revolutionary approach to the development of the Irish Health Services.

Our health system is broken. The quadrupling of the Irish health budget since 1997 has proved one thing - a poorly organised and managed health system cannot be fixed with money alone. Ireland is spending close to the EU average on health, on a per capita basis, but Irish people are receiving a level of service well below the EU average. Ireland’s health service is ranked 15th in Europe for quality and 24th in terms of value for money.

Our poor health system continues to affect every city, town and village in Ireland.

Fine Gael will:
• abolish long-term waits on trolleys in A&E
• slash waiting lists in hospitals
• eliminate the unfair and inefficient public/private divide by introducing Universal Health Insurance (UHI).
• reform the Primary Care system to ensure that more patients are treated safely outside hospitals by their GPs.

Five Key Principles of FairCare Fine Gael’s approach to healthcare reform is essentially pragmatic. We are not bound by ideology or dogma, but will apply to Ireland best practice from other successful health systems. However, FairCare is underpinned by five key principles:
1. Access is a right - not a privilege
2. Transparency and efficiency are not optional extras
3. Fairness: Equal treatment for equal need
4. Choice for all
5. Accountability: The buck stops where?

Primary Care Reform is Crucial

Fine Gael will give Primary Care the priority it deserves. By the end of our first term in Government, we will have a comprehensive network of new Primary Care centres to serve our communities. The centres will also include rooms for visiting specialists and will accommodate a robust community mental health service.

A 3-Phase Programme

The FairCare programme is divided into three distinct, but over-lapping phases that will allow us to gradually introduce reforms in a way that is both carefully planned and affordable.

Phase 1: Maximise what we have (Implemented from Year 1) In the first phase of FairCare, we will change the way hospitals work and will also significantly strengthen Ireland’s Primary Care system.

Fine Gael will as part of our hospital reform programme:
• Make the Minister of Health directly responsible for hitting key targets;
• Measure progress daily by real time information systems;
• Establish a Special Delivery Unit to assist the Minister.

A similar unit was successfully used in Northern Ireland to cut waiting list times by 80% from 2004 to 2008 without significantly increasing expenditure.

Fine Gael recognises that significant bed capacity in hospitals could also be freed up if patients facing delayed discharge or requiring rehabilitation could be treated in the Community. We will be publishing specific proposals on this issue over the next few months to address the current deficits in long-term care and rehabilitation.

Phase 2: Introduce “Money Follows the Patient” (Year 3) Under the current system of fixed budgets, each additional patient is effectively a “cost” to the health service. This system provides no incentives for efficiency or productivity. Under Money Follows The Patient (MFTP), health providers will be paid for how many patients they treat. Patients will be a source of “income” rather than a “cost”, just as they are in private hospitals today. Long term, we expect MFTP to increase efficiency by as much as 10%.

Phase 3: “Universal Health Insurance” (Implemented in Year 5) Once the first and second phases of FairCare have been successfully implemented, Fine Gael will introduce Universal Health Insurance (UHI), a system that is widely used in Europe and in Canada.

Fine Gael will introduce the Dutch model of UHI in Ireland, with mandatory health insurance for everyone, to be chosen from a selection of providers. The Netherlands spends only slightly more than us on health on a per capita basis, but is ranked number 1 in Europe for quality and Number 2 for value for money.

Our goal is to transform the Irish health service into one of the best in Europe, and create a health system that we can all be proud of. For more information log on to www.faircare.ie.

Local Hospitals Have a Key Role to Play under FairCare Fine Gael has a very different view of the role to be played by local hospitals than the Government, which seems intent on downgrading them.

Local hospitals must be safe, and patient safety must be our first priority. International research suggests that complex trauma and complex surgery is not appropriate in a local hospital setting. However, there is also a very strong argument that local hospitals must have the ability to deal with complex medical conditions and less complex surgery. Safety is not simply about surgical competence, but is also about timely access. Time to treatment, particularly in remote geographical locations, is absolutely crucial. Over the summer Fine Gael will be further developing its policy on local hospitals.

9. Tackling Anti Social Behaviour

Communities all around Ireland are plagued by anti social behaviour. Fine Gael recognises the seriousness of the problem and that existing measures to tackle antisocial behaviour have failed. Seemingly minor crimes, such as graffiti, underage drinking, driving a “souped up” car around built up areas late at night and loitering in a menacing way, can make life hell for communities. We believe that the implementation of our proposals will protect communities and vindicate the right of each citizen to live peacefully and safely in their neighbourhoods.

Fine Gael will:

Target Bad Planning & Anti Social Hotspots
The idea of ‘community’ must become central to the planning process, with due care taken of the social implications of large numbers of houses and people in close proximity. Bad environmental planning can, and does, have a critical impact on the levels of anti social behaviour which develop in an area. In effect it can result in the creation of an area where anti social behaviour can potentially thrive. Fine Gael will develop a Good Practice Guide for planners and developers to make housing developments, streets and parks safer, better places. The aim of the guide will be to draw attention to crime prevention principles.

Promote Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing
Fine Gael welcomes the roll out of Joint Policing Committees and the opportunity for a greater level of engagement and co-operation between An Garda Siochana and the local community. With the type of crime differing substantially between one local authority area and another, it is vital that the Gardaí, public representatives, and the local community come together in a structured way to discuss matters affecting their areas. Fine Gael has been a strong proponent of establishing a proper system of community policing to work in tandem with community involvement on Joint Policing Committees. We will change Garda organisational structures to reflect a focus on community based policing and an acknowledgement of the value of the Gardaí involved in it, which will include a new grade of Community Garda, a review of the Garda Reserve and immediate implementation of the Garda Inspectorate’s recommendations on Garda rosters.

Roll out Estate Managers for all Estates
Often, Resident Associations do not know who the owner of privately rented accommodation is. This can cause frustration particularly if there are difficulties with the tenant or maintenance of the property. Most local authorities have Estate Managers who maintain estates and make local authority estates better places to live in. This is being rolled out now into some private estates. We will ensure that all estates – private or local authority – have an Estate Manager assigned to it. As part of this increased co-operation between residents and the local authority, the Private Residential Tenancies Board will also be required to share contact information for landlords and their tenants with the estate managers.

Introduce Repair Orders for Commercial or Publicly Owned Property
Based on the success of the Anti Social Behaviour policies adopted in other jurisdictions (e.g. Broken Windows in New York) we propose amending legislation to oblige the owners of defaced or dilapidated commercial or publicly owned property to repair any vandalism in public view within one week. In default of appropriate action, the local authority will be required to serve a Repair Notice, and if necessary, carry out the repairs. Except in exceptional circumstances the local authority would then recover the cost from the property owner.

Some local authorities have a poor record of looking after their own property. We will expect all local authorities to comply fully with the high standards demanded of them in this regard.

Enforce law on modified ‘Souped up’ Vehicles
Convoys of “souped-up” cars patrol certain areas causing nuisance and intimidation. The presence and actions of these “boy racers”, with tinted privacy glass, noisy engines, and modified registration plates and lights, can frighten and intimidate those in their vicinity. The legal limit for exhaust noise is 80 decibels, yet roadside checks have revealed readings of up to 130 decibels. With regards to privacy glass, many after market fittings do not conform to the legal standards. Companies fitting both loud exhausts and tinted windows know that the Gardaí do not have the equipment to measure the standards of these products. By breaching these requirements, it also becomes a road safety concern which affects all motorists.

We want to enforce the law and protect the public from such nuisance and fear. It is possible to bring forward prosecutions on souped-up vehicles once the Gardaí receive the necessary detection equipment. We will facilitate the monitoring and detection equipment in all main Garda stations.

10. Supporting Communities

Fine Gael is committed to delivering public services we can be proud of that responds to the needs of all citizens and provides people with the quality of life they deserve.

Fine Gael will:

Develop a National Carers Strategy
Fine Gael is committed to developing and implementing a comprehensive national carers strategy that will address the immediate and long term concerns of carers, including: financial support, provision of services, assessment of need, recognition of young carers, and further training.

Develop and Encourage Home Support
Fine Gael will prioritise the development and roll-out of support services for older people who wish to remain in their in their own home, including: home help, home care, meals-on-wheels and other services that promote independent living.

Fine Gael will encourage Local Government to organise a handypersons service where volunteers will provide basic assistance to older people such as changing light bulbs, delivering shopping and so on.

Promote Supported Housing
Fine Gael will actively promote supported housing schemes to enable older people to live comfortably and independently in their community for as long as possible, with adequate access to community and health facilities. Fine Gael sees Local Government playing a central role in identifying and responding to the supported housing needs of its community.

Implement Disability Strategy
Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the National Disability Strategy and the departmental Sectoral Plans will be implemented in full; that people are supported in living as independently as possible and are enabled to participate fully in society.

Reform Homeless Service and Facilities
Fine Gael believes that homeless facilities and services should be the prime responsibility of Local Government. To date, HSE funding problems has restricted the delivery of homeless service. Fine Gael plans to remove the health service as provider of homeless services, thus restoring decision making in this area to Local Government. See the Fine Gael reform document ‘Power to the People’ for further information.

Reform Rural Transport
Fine Gael will ensure resources provided for rural transport services are used adequately in the best interests of the community and ensure more services are rolled out across the country to meet the needs of those living in isolated communities.

Protect Community Services
Fine Gael is opposed to the continued withdrawal of rural services and is committed to retaining an adequate network of rural post offices, Garda stations, supports for the elderly living alone and is committed to delivering targeted community services where they are most needed.

Immigration
Fine Gael is committed to putting in place a system of immigration which is fair and transparent, tough on fraud and addresses Ireland economic needs and circumstances in a manner which is respectful of the rights of potential migrants.

11. Improving our Universities

Improving the quality of our universities and increasing the number of students attending those universities is absolutely necessary to maintain our status as a highly skilled and flexible work force. This was part of our former economic success and will form part of our future success.

The challenges facing the sector are significant. The sector has globalised. The funding of the third level sector has not kept up with either education inflation or the increased number of undergraduate students participating. Specialisation within third level colleges will be critical to their success in the future.

In March, Fine Gael published The Third Way – a Green Paper on Higher Education Reform (available at www.finegael.ie).

Fine Gael will:
• Oppose the re-introduction of third level fees (and existing registration fees): We see fees (and existing registration fees) as a barrier to participation at third level. We believe that the funding gap for third level sector cannot be met from general taxation.
• Develop a new graduate contribution scheme: We have proposed the idea that graduates should pay through a system of deferred contribution after they graduate. Once graduates begin to gain the economic benefit from their education, they should pay up to 30% of the cost of their degree programme. The contribution will be collected through the PRSI system. The funds raised should be ring-fenced for the reform of the third level sector into a Third Level Change Budget. The institutions can then compete for some of the Third Level Change Budget for reform purposes.
• Establish an integrated qualifications and quality assurance body: It would bring together the agencies currently involved in awarding qualifications and measuring quality in the sector. This body would have overall responsibility for value of course content, teaching performance and research output within every institution across the country. Linked to quality assessment is the requirement to introduce an effective mentoring system.
• Review the current maintenance grant system: to ensure that there is reasonable support available for those who want to go back to College.
• Promote third level specialisation and expertise: We have seven Universities and 14 Institutes of Technology in the Country. It is Fine Gael’s view that each third level institution should examine where its strengths lie, what area of expertise it has the most potential to succeed in and produce a plan outlining its intentions and strategic vision for this area of education provision. An overarching umbrella University or federation for the entire Institute of Technology sector should be introduced. In devising new course programmes, an industry and labour markets needs survey should be a mandatory pre-requisite.

12. Improving our Schools

Fine Gael recognises that all children should receive a quality education, providing each individual child with the opportunity to achieve his/her full potential in a wellresourced, supportive learning environment. However, across the country schools are now under-funded, under–resourced and insufficiently supported. Schools are buckling under the pressure of mounting running costs, voluntary contributions from parents have become a necessary burden and cloakrooms posing as classrooms have become an all too frequent occurrence.

Fine Gael Proposals:

Fine Gael would completely reform the School Building Programme The current School Building Programme is lacking in transparency, accountability or any level of efficiency. Fine Gael would carry out a thorough reform of the programme designed to speed up delivery of new and extended schools, provide schools and parents with a clear indication of where their schools sits on the building waiting list and ensure the system is based on need rather than the political motivation favoured by the current Government

Make Local Government legally responsible for identifying and zone school sites If Local Government was given full responsibility for sites for schools they could bring a better level of co-ordination at local level to make the best use of local resources for the community. Fine Gael has already proposed that Compulsory Purchase Orders should be considered for school sites in the absence of any other options.

Eliminate levels of waste involved in providing temporary accommodation.

Direct engagement with suppliers of temporary accommodation in order to bring down rental costs of prefabs and reduce exorbitant level of funding currently wasted on temporary accommodation at the expense of new and improved schools.

Protect Frontline Services Eliminate waste and streamline delivery of educational services, particularly in relation to the wide array of quangos introduced under the current Government in order to encourage greater efficiency, quality of delivery and protect frontline staff in all schools.

Publication of Annual Reports Introduce a system of Annual Reports for schools, providing parents with a well-rounded view of local schools and to ensure the substantial level of information needed to make a real and informed choice on their child’s future education is made available.

ICT Systems in Schools Reform the ICT system within schools, upgrading the current inadequate levels of ICT infrastructure available and providing students with exposure to the latest technology needed to ensure our educational system is in line with other developed countries and introducing the groundwork needed to develop a competitive and well educated workforce.

Primary Pupil Database We will prioritise the development of a Primary Pupil Database to track the progress of all children through the primary school system throughout the country on to second level education, helping to tackle issues such as absenteeism, special needs requirements and providing a means of assessing the various bodies involved in coordinating and delivering support services to schools.

13. Transport

The lack of serious investment in transport by the Government during our boom years was a lost opportunity. It was a mistake that will make it even harder for Ireland to emerge successfully from the economic recession. For many of us it is still as difficult to move around within our own towns and cities as it was ten years ago. In fact recent figures show that usage of private cars within Dublin city centre has actually increased in recent times. These transport failures are because there has not been a fundamental shift in transport policy with this Government, including the Green Party.

Fine Gael would prioritise the needs of pedestrians

The needs of the pedestrian should be paramount in transport and urban planning. Fine Gael would require each local authority to develop a ‘Pedestrian Charter’ outlining the needs of pedestrians in their house and policy principles that should be incorporated into all relevant Council policy and action plans.

Making cycling a mainstream transport option

The only way to promote cycling is to provide a safe and sensible cycling environment to encourage people back on to their bikes. To this end Fine Gael proposes the following.

Future road construction to include sensible segregated cycle lanes

It has been obvious to all cyclists that Government policy of painting a white line on the road and calling it a cycle lane has failed. The cheap option has actively discouraged cyclists and led to a creation of a dangerous environment. All future planned road reconstructions for QBCs, road works and utility installations should include designs for a new segregated cycle lane as part of the rebuilding works.

Cycling should be central in the planning process

Cycle strategies should become a mandatory part of any ‘transport plans’ associated with large planning applications to ensure developers provide cycling facilities and paths through any large developments

Bicycle Parking

County Councils need to incorporate large bike parking facilities into their urban designs. These facilities need to be in secure, public, and bright locations. While some modes of transport already have provided bicycle parking facilities there needs to be greater pressure to roll out of parking facilities at all rail stations where possible and along QBC routes.

The creation of cycle highways

Fine Gael realises that Government and local authorities find themselves in an extremely challenging economic situation due to the mishandling of the national finances. However, plans should be made for future development of new cycling facilities to be implemented when finances recover or as budgets allow.

Ireland, and Dublin in particular, has massive potential for the development of exclusive cycle paths or ‘cycle highways’. These lanes would have long stretches of path without having to encounter traffic or many junctions. The Canals, Luas Lines, Dublin Bay, old primary routes and disused railway lines are all prime locations for additional cycle lanes. For more information see the Fine Gael Local Government Reform policy, ‘Power to the People’.

Fine Gael will fast track bus competition

The public transport commuters of Ireland, and in particular Dublin, have remained nearly totally reliant on State owned transport companies for their travelling needs. Fine Gael has long argued that this protected and sheltered market should be opened up to eager private operators which would improve services levels for all commuters.

Fine Gael will create new ‘Park & Ride’ facilities and bus lanes

After years of promises the Government continues to fail to implement the simplest transport policies that would make a big impact on commuting times. There is still no national network of park and ride facilities around major urban centres. Fine Gael will ensure that the Dublin Transport Authority and local authorities will deliver on creating new high capacity parking facilities outside major urban centres that are linked by QBCs.

14. Developing Agriculture

The current economic climate highlights more than ever the importance of existing sustainable indigenous industries and provides an opportunity for the agricultural sector and the farming community to play a strong role in revitalising the economy. Fine Gael is committed to overcoming the challenges facing the agricultural sector and retaining our strong family farm tradition while also fostering an environment where those involved in the industry are provided with new and exciting opportunities for development and change.

Fine Gael Proposals:

A sustainable future for the agricultural community Fine Gael recognises that targeted State supports and clever use of available funds are needed to support the farming community and is committed to retaining and investing in programmes aimed at revitalising and sustaining the agricultural sector.

EU Funds Fine Gael is committed to the use of unused CAP funds in a targeted and specific way to revitalise ailing areas of the agricultural industry such as the sheep sector.

Reduction of Red Tape and Needless Bureaucracy The Agricultural Sector more than any other industry has been subject to the introduction of endless amounts of red tape and excessive levels of bureaucracy. There is a simpler way of doing business and Fine Gael is committed to streamlining the amount of paperwork and the inspection system currently in place to provide farmers with the freedom to farm.

Playing a Key Role in Rebuilding Ireland

Fine Gael’s plan for Rebuilding Ireland will free up available funds within the Department of Agriculture so existing schemes will be protected, allow farmers the opportunity to develop additional incomes through a revitalised afforestation programme supported by a newly developed bioenergy sector and to earn significant extra income through investment in micro generation on their lands and the sale of unused energy to a national grid.

Exploiting the Potential of the Agri-food Sector

Fine Gael recognises the potential of the agri-food sector to stimulate job creation and economic growth and is committed to reforming food traceability and monitoring systems to eradicate any weaknesses in the system, to reduce the myriad of agencies involved in regulating the sector and ensure Irish producers are competing on a level playing field with other countries.

WTO Talks
Fine Gael will not support any more agricultural concessions at WTO talks and is committed to protecting the agricultural sector from the unrealistic demands put forward in the last round of Doha negotiations.

"Local 2009: Green Party","Foreword

The Green Party/Comhaontas Glas was founded 27 years ago based on the following seven principles:
• The impact of society on the environment should not be ecologically disruptive
• Conservation of resources is vital to a sustainable society
• All political, social and economic decisions should be taken at the lowest effective level
• Society should be guided by self-reliance and co-operation at all levels
• As caretakers of the earth, we have the responsibility to pass it on in a fit and healthy state
• The need for world peace overrides national and commercial interests
• The poverty of two-thirds of the world’s family demands a redistribution of the world’s resources

These principles reflect the Green Party’s vision for politics – one which understands the connection between political action and the social, environmental and economic consequences of that action. In keeping with these principles, the Green Party has a longstanding commitment to environmental and social justice at all levels from local to international. We believe that the best way to achieve a sustainable, equitable society is to think globally and act locally in every aspect of our lives; this begins with the community in which we live.

This manifesto outlines the policies pursued by the Green Party in order to achieve these aims along with the actions that we consider necessary at a local level to lead to a better quality of life for all. We believe this will be achieved by creating better communities that are socially inclusive, economically vibrant and therefore strong enough to adapt effectively to economic and social change.

This is the Green Party’s first time approaching an election in government. The current economic downturn means that we have had to accept not only lower investment than we had hoped for in certain areas but indeed budgetary cuts which, during a healthier financial period, we could not have imagined, much less accepted.

Nonetheless, despite financial constraints, our policies remain guided by our fundamental principles and a belief that there will come a period of economic renewal driven by green economics. The Green Party does not make promises – we make policy, which we then aim to follow through on in government.

This manifesto outlines our policies and how they translate at a local level through Green councillors who work extremely hard to put these policies into action so as to create the kind of society in which we can all be proud to participate.

Executive summary

The Green Party’s vision for politics is one which understands the connection between political action and the social, environmental and economic consequences of that action. Our vision begins with the communities in which we live and we believe that the best way to secure our future is to create better communities that are socially inclusive, economically vibrant and therefore strong enough to adapt effectively to economic and social change. This manifesto outlines our policies and how they translate at a local level through Green councillors who work very hard to put these policies into action to create the kind of society in which we can all be proud to participate.

Local government

Democracy and accountability are key issues for the Green Party. We believe that decision-making should be taken at the lowest effective level and be as close as possible to the people affected by those decisions. For this reason, Green Minister John Gormley continues to drive local government reform. This is about changing the rules so that ordinary people can participate and have their voices heard.

Stronger local economies

The Green Party advocates a transition from a fossil-fuel dependent economy to a low-carbon, green economy, with all of the economic, social and environmental benefits that entails. This transition begins at a local level. The Green Party wants to develop a thriving local enterprise culture in an appropriate and transparent manner taking account of the need for sustainability and for accountability to all members of society. Our objective is to strengthen local economies in order to reduce their exposure to global market fluctuations. Green ministers Eamon Ryan, John Gormley and Trevor Sargent have taken action at national level to lay the groundwork for transition to a new green economy and our councillors are ready to follow through on their progress at local level.

Planning better communities

The Green Party has for many years called for more efficient use of public resources and a more transparent planning system to create sustainable communities through qualitative development rather than quantitative expansion. Although the past cannot be changed, our challenge now is to redesign communities to better serve their purpose – to deliver a better quality of life. Minister John Gormley has ensured the strengthening of planning laws through legislative instruments. Green councillors ensure the adoption of these strategies into development plans and local area plans to optimise development of new and existing communities.

Creating closer communities

Community development is fundamental to the creation of better communities which offer a good quality of life. Local authorities have a significant role to play in building communities through good planning and the provision of housing, community spaces and inclusive services. Green Party councillors are committed to social and environmental justice, which can be achieved only through the endeavours of strong, cooperating communities.

Growing greener communities

Green communities are strong communities. We believe that a ‘green lifestyle’, with the least impact on natural resources, is the only way to sustain not only our environment but also our economy and ultimately, our society. The impact of climate change on many aspects of our lives is now vividly apparent. There is no longer a choice; we must change direction and choose a greener path or face dire consequences economically, socially and environmentally. Transition to a low-carbon, green society begins with individuals and the communities in which they live. Local authorities are well-placed to facilitate this change and Green Party councillors have a deep understanding of the issues involved.

Local government

Participation in the democratic process

Ireland is one of the most centralised democratic states in Europe, which means that local authorities in Ireland do not have the same decision-making power on local issues as their counterparts throughout Europe.

The Green Party believes that decisions should be taken at the lowest effective level, as close as possible to the people affected.

Local authorities must therefore be given more powers, with true decentralisation of decision-making out of Dublin, not a mere moving of offices around the state.

It is not only local authorities that require greater power, so do the people, via better accountability and more involvement. Democracy and accountability are key issues for the Green Party. We believe that in tandem with greater powers for local authorities, there must be greater accountability to the communities they serve through more robust regulation and greater transparency in their day-to-day business. Only by these means can local communities ensure that their interests are at the heart of local government.

In keeping with Green Party policy to strengthen and democratise local government, Green Party Minister John Gormley and his department are currently finalising a white paper on local government reform to consolidate local authority powers not only in the area of ‘hard’ services such as housing, roads and water but also in terms of the ‘softer’ tasks related to community-building. In practice, the proposals in the white paper will ensure:
• Greater decision-making power at local level balanced by rigorous national standards
• Transparency
• Accountability
• Value for money
• Greater powers in the area of raising and spending finance locally
• Greater community involvement in local government

We believe that local government reform is about changing the rules so that ordinary people can participate and have their voices heard.

We want people to be involved in running their own communities.

Green councillors work hard to ensure access to and participation in the democratic system for all citizens so that they are actively informed of and involved in decisions that affect their lives. Our councillors also support the process of participatory budgeting at local government level, which allows citizens who are impacted by the local authority budget to have a say in how that some funds are allocated.

At work in your community... Minister John Gormley recently introduced limits on election spending to ensure a level playing field for all election candidates. This means that standing for election is accessible to everyone and not just those with

How can you participate in local government?

1. First and foremost, you can participate in local government by using your vote at election time. By voting for those who you believe will best represent you, you are participating in the democratic system.

2. Make yourself aware of what is going on at local level by:
• Reading local newspapers where council proceedings are reported.
• Attending council meetings as an observer in the public area or via webcasts where these are available. If webcasts are not available, ask your elected representatives to make such a facility available and to allow council meetings to be more accessible to the public by whatever means possible. In addition, ask that all discussions and decisions taken be made available on the internet.
• Sign up to your council’s database to receive e-alerts (via SMS or email), in which the council informs you of important issues such as water shortages, road closures, and planning consultations/decisions. Again, if e-alerts are not available, ask your local representatives to ensure that a council database is set up. Green councillors are already doing this but many local authorities do not yet have Green Party members to make this request for you.
• Check the attendance lists for council meetings to ensure you are being represented as fully as possible.

At work in your community... Councillors David Healy, Joe Corr and Robert Kelly in Fingal County Council ensured the online broadcasting of council meetings

3. On local issues that are important to you, such as development plans, local authority spending, traffic management, water quality, make your views known to your local authority so that they become aware of local opinion. You can do this in the following ways:
• Contact your elected representatives by phone, email, in writing or in person.
• Make a submission on local development plans.
• Ask your elected representatives to allow for a local plebiscite on vital local issues that will affect the whole community so that citizens can express their views through a direct vote.

At work in your community... Councillors Caroline Burrell, Ciarán O’Brien and Steven Matthews in Bray, Co Wicklow proposed a motion, which was accepted by Bray Town Council, to set up a citizens’ contact database in order to engage better with local residents on important local issue
• Ask your elected representatives to facilitate the use of citizens’ petitions so that if enough signatures are gathered, a motion is tabled on which councillors must vote.
• Ask your elected representatives for the facility of e-surveys in which members of the public respond to texts or emails from their local authority seeking their opinion on specific issues.
• Ask your elected representatives to consider introducing a participatory budgeting process for part of the local authority budget.

In brief…
• The Green Party believes that decision-making should be taken at the lowest effective level, as close as possible to the people affected by those decisions.
• Democracy and accountability are key issues for the Green Party.
• The white paper on local government reform being introduced by Minister John Gormley proposes changing the rules so that local citizens can participate and have their voices heard.
• You can participate more in local government by doing the following:
• Use your vote.
• Make yourself aware.
• Make your views known.

Stronger local economies

The Green Party has long recognised that the global economy is intimately connected with the Earth’s environment and that climate change along with the impending arrival of ‘peak oil’, has a dramatic impact on the functioning of the world’s economy. This is why the Green Party encourages a global transition from a growth-economy to a steady-state, low-carbon, green economy, with the lowest possible dependence on fossil fuels and on practices that contributes to climate change. 

Transition to a low-carbon green economy begins with each individual and the community in which they live. It is about real active citizenship and involves making choices that are both environmentally and economically sustainable so that communities can increase their resilience to the impact of adverse external events.

The Green Party also recognises that Ireland’s future economic success lies in the ability of our small to medium-sized businesses to compete both nationally and internationally. We need to move away from an over-reliance on foreign direct investment and to develop home-grown enterprises - in particular, green (low-carbon) enterprise - in an open and transparent manner that restores confidence in the Irish economy.

This transition to an indigenous green economy involves a strong commitment from government on energy and communication costs in order to stimulate business, as well as a commitment to funding research and development in the energy sector, which brings a large return and is key to stimulating the economy.

Minister Eamon Ryan has shown this commitment through a number of measures in the areas of energy efficiency, energy security, renewable energy production and an efficient communications structure including broadband. These measures are creating indigenous jobs.

In addition, Minister John Gormley has overseen the setting up of a high level action group to advise on the development of Ireland’s green economy which will examine all practices that contribute to climate change.

At European level, a ‘Green New Deal’ aims to create an economy driven by long-term prosperity, not short-term profiteering. It discourages the risky speculation and over-exploitation that traps us in a boom-to-bust cycle and promotes sustainable and ethical development under which prosperity is defined by the well-being of all people.

opportunities for economic stimulation and job creation in the new green economy, which is gaining momentum in both Europe and the USA.

There are other issues which must be addressed in order to stimulate the green economy, such as the provision of a sustainable, cohesive transport system, wages and exchange rates. These issues must be tackled in a creative manner in order to reverse the negative impact they have had on our economy to date.

At local level, the Green Party wants to help develop a thriving local enterprise culture in an appropriate and transparent manner, taking account of the need for sustainability and for accountability to all members of society. Our objective is to strengthen local economies in order to reduce their exposure to global market fluctuations. Green councillors support and facilitate community-based economies, where local and moral purchasing is paramount to the functioning of an efficient and vibrant local economy. This embodies the green philosophy ‘think globally, act locally’.

Local authorities are well-placed to support and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy as quickly, smoothly and successfully as possible because this transition is essentially local in nature. For example, through good planning policy, local authorities can approve micro-generation projects for renewable energy. Green councillors are best placed to drive the necessary actions for transition to a low-carbon economy at a local level because of their indepth understanding of the issues in question.

Supporting local business

Although local authorities do not traditionally have specific powers in the economic arena, the day-to-day operation of local authorities can have a significant impact on the local economy which in turn contributes to the national economy. In addition, there is a range of actions that local authorities can take to support and develop the business community. Research shows that where people feel invested in their community, they will know local businesses, buy from one another and feel connected to one another. Enterprise development is a core function of local authorities in Northern Ireland, and through local government reform the Green Party would like to see similar powers for all local authorities in the rest of the island.

Green jobs

The economic growth and jobs of the future will come from the new clean technologies, which will also mitigate some of our environmental problems. The Green Party nationally has demonstrated its capacity to safeguard vital investment in key areas such as energy, which will lead to huge growth in the green jobs sector.

Communications

The Green Party is strongly committed to improving communications that will drive business development. Eamon Ryan as Minister for Energy and Communications has worked hard to deliver the next generation broadband.

The rollout of the national broadband scheme began in January 2009 and the aim is to achieve 100% broadband coverage throughout Ireland by September 2010. In addition, all secondlevel schools will be provided with 100Mbit connectivity commencing in January 2009.

Tourism

The Green Party recognises the large contribution of tourism to the local economy. We want to develop a tourism industry that places greater emphasis on activity holidays such as cycling, walking, angling, sailing, horse-riding; a policy that promotes the very essence of Irish country living and its landscape.

At work in your community...Councillor Mark Dearey in Louth has revived the Dundalk St Patrick’s Day parade. An estimated 30,000 people attended this year’s event

Agriculture

Current agricultural policies have let the farming community down. The Green Party wants to see Ireland’s farmers and producers establishing world-class products and becoming market leaders by excelling in green production techniques, reducing chemical and energy inputs – which will cut costs – and rejecting genetically-modified (GM) crops throughout the island. The Green Party’s programme plans for the development of appropriately-scaled enterprises in close proximity to areas of agricultural production or in new rural enterprise zones located in towns. Trevor Sargent, Minister of State for Food and Horticulture, is strongly pursuing these aims at national and international level.

Forestry

Woodlands and forests play an essential role in providing us with fresh air, clean water, fertile soil and a stable climate. Trees help prevent soil erosion, drought and flooding, yet only 4% of our land area is tree covered. From a functional and economic point of view, trees are one of the most important renewable and sustainable resources available to this country. Trees are also of great aesthetic value and contribute to the lives of all.

At work in your community... Councillors Caroline Burrell and Ciarán O’Brien tabled a successful motion at Bray Town Council to have the town declared a ‘GMO-free zone’ banning the growth of genetically modified organisms within the boundaries of the town

Stronger local economies

In brief…
• The Green Party advocates a transition to a low-carbon (green) economy, with all of the economic, social and environmental benefits that entails.
• The Green Party believes that this transition begins at a local level.
• The Green Party wants to develop a thriving local enterprise culture in an appropriate and transparent manner taking account of the need for sustainability and accountability to all members of society.
• Our objective is to strengthen local economies in order to reduce their exposure to global market fluctuations.
• Ministers Eamon Ryan, John Gormley and Trevor Sargent have taken action at national level to lay the groundwork for transition to a new green economy, which Green councillors are ready to follow through on at local level.

Planning better communities

The Green Party has long recognised the detrimental effects of poor planning on the quality of life in Ireland and on the Irish economy. For many years we have called for more efficient use of public resources and a more transparent planning system to create sustainable communities through qualitative development rather than quantitative expansion. Although the past cannot be changed, our challenge now is to redesign communities to better serve their purpose – to deliver a better quality of life.

Minister John Gormley is reinforcing the role of the Regional Planning Authorities and the Dublin Transport Authority in setting development objectives for the creation of better living environments; environments that are sustainable well into the future and that offer people a better quality of life in the standard of their accommodation, their travel patterns, and their access to essential services and community facilities. New development, as it occurs, is to be made conditional on the targeted funding of community facilities, especially schools.

Legislation on unauthorised and poor quality development is being strengthened through various instruments including the guidelines on sustainable urban development in cities, towns and villages and the planning and development bill. This legislation aims to ensure best practice in planning and development and to end the developer-led approach to planning in Ireland that has ignored the social, economic and environmental consequences of rising transport dependence and energy consumption.

At local government level, Green councillors ensure the adoption of these strategies in development plans and local area plans in order to optimise development of new and existing communities. As part of our initiative to improve local government so that it will be more accessible, accountable and representative of its citizens, we are reforming the planning system at the ‘front end’ of local government. This reform will remove barriers to participation and help people through information and contact to understand planning objectives and engage with the system in a way that makes it more efficient for all concerned.

The planning process

At a local level the Green Part insists on the rigorous application of new legislation and a transparent and professional decision, planning and enforcement process. At local level Green councillors work to ensure:

Urban planning

That the focus of residential planning is on the creation of long-term sustainable communities with priority given to appropriate community facilities prior to the building of houses and that climate change proofing is incorporated into all local authority decision-making procedures. Also that all local development plans lay down standards on energy efficiency and the use of renewables, based on improved building standards introduced by Minister John Gormley in 2008.

At work in your community... Councillors Caroline Burrell, Ciarán O’Brien and Steven Matthews on Bray Town Council were instrumental in having an urban habitat map produced for Bray, Co Wicklow. This can now be used in making future planning decisions.

Landscape planning

That local landscape managers and landscape plans fully include the terms of the European landscape convention and that new regional and national parks are established in areas of high amenity.

Rural planning

That local authorities buy or compulsorily purchase land banks around villages and provide serviced sites at cost to residents so that shops, schools and other facilities and amenities are located within walking distance. Also that rural planning policies give preference to those who make an economic contribution to the rural community in which they wish to live.

Land use

That in keeping with the recommendations of the Kenny Report (1973) local authorities establish a development levy mechanism to ensure maximum benefit from land rezoning; and that revenue generated in this manner is used for the benefit of the community, including through the provision of community facilities.

At work in your community... Councillors Ciarán O’Brien, Caroline Burrell and Steven Matthews in Bray, Co Wicklow helped protect local residents from flooding by contributing to the prevention of a major new housing development at the mouth of the river Dargle. They also succeeded in having Bray Head designated as a special amenity area.

Housing

The numbers waiting on housing lists show that the property boom failed to meet the needs of ordinary people. Practices such as land speculation and the hoarding of zoned land distorted the housing market and impeded the provision of affordable housing. Again, Minister John Gormley followed through on Green Party policy with the housing (miscellaneous provisions) bill 2008. At local level our councillors ensure the full implementation of this legislation so that:

New housing developments

All housing action plans incorporate a sustainable communities ethos and all new housing developments include a mix of social, affordable and owner-occupied housing. Also that greater options for sheltered housing for the elderly are provided in the private, social and affordable housing sectors.

Established developments

Outside bodies (management companies) cannot be allowed by local authorities to take over the management of an estate without the support of the majority of residents and management agents are strictly policed by the national property services regulatory authority. Also that local authorities work to ensure a high uptake among householders of newly available grants for insulation and energy efficiency under the home energy savings scheme, the warmer homes scheme and the greener homes scheme, which the Green Party has initiated in government.

Social and affordable housing

Social housing is placed at the centre of local authority housing service plans and the availability of a sufficient number of social and affordable housing units is ensured to clear the waiting lists. Also that developers are prohibited from using land or financial transfer to opt out of building social housing units within new residential schemes so that 20% of new developments consist of social and affordable units.

At work in your community... Councillors Ciarán O’Brien, Caroline Burrell and Steven Matthews ensured that the Luas line will be extended to Bray, Co Wicklow

Infrastructure

Green councillors seek to ensure that all development plans include relevant infrastructure such as schools, light rail, health centres, shops, sport and recreational facilities, libraries, parks, open spaces, community spaces, galleries and museums with the help of the sustainable urban development guidelines (2009) and the planning and development legislation being introduced by Green Minister John Gormley.

At work in your community... Councillor Malcolm Noonan, Kilkenny County Council, secured record funding for the rollout of cycle lanes in Kilkenny

Transport

Ireland is one of the most car dependent countries in the world. The Green Party’s policy on transport contains a comprehensive package of measures aimed at shifting Ireland’s transport focus from unsustainable road building to the provision of quality public transport operating at maximum efficiency along with well-designed walking and cycling routes (for details on the Government’s Cycle to Work scheme, which was introduced in January, see: www.bikescheme.ie.)

Our policy aims to improve the quality of life in our streets, towns, and rural areas, reduce traffic deaths and injuries, improve accessibility, reduce our national fuel bill and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

At work in your community... Councillor Brian Meaney, who sits on Clare County Council, campaigned for a commuter rail service between Ennis and Limerick, which is now up and running and has exceeded all expectations. Brian has also been a main driving force behind the campaign for the western rail corridor

At present, local authorities do not have direct control over many aspects of transport policy and the Green Party would like to see this change so that local transport needs are met efficiently within the context of national transport policy.

At work in your community... Councillors Gene Feighery, Ruairí Holohan, Terence Corish and Tom Kivlehan ensured that Dún LaoghaireRathdown County Council are leading the way in the introduction of recharging points for electric vehicles

Planning better communities

In brief…
• The Green Party advocates more efficient use of public resources and a more transparent planning system to create sustainable communities through qualitative development rather than quantitative expansion.
• Our challenge now is to redesign communities to better serve their purpose – to deliver a better quality of life.
• Minister John Gormley has ensured the strengthening of planning legislation through various legislative instruments.
• Green councillors ensure the adoption of these strategies into development plans and local area plans to optimise development of new and existing communities.

Creating closer communities

The Green Party recognises that community development is fundamental to the creation of better communities that offer a good quality of life. We believe that the sound development of a community depends on the active participation of as many members of that community as possible. The extent to which individuals can participate in their community is dependent on the services and facilities available to them.

Local authorities, therefore, have a significant role to play in building communities through good planning and the provision of housing, community spaces and inclusive services.

Green Party councillors are committed to social and environmental justice, which can be achieved only through the endeavours of strong communities.

Community spaces

Community spaces are a key issue in the development of community. Community groups require low-cost facilities in which to meet and carry out their activities and young people, in particular, require places to go where they can gather together in an unstructured way without being accused of anti-social behaviour. All members of the community require sport and recreation facilities to improve their quality of life.

In the consultation leading to the development of a national play strategy for Ireland, more than 2,000 children wrote to the Minister for Children, identifying play and recreation as a major quality of life issue for them. Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises “the right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities”. Yet, many children live in communities with minimum or no play and recreational facilities.

At work in your community... Councillor David Healy successfully campaigned to have three new playgrounds installed in his local area at Howth, Baldoyle and Bayside

Safer communities

Our educational system, the planning of our housing estates, support for community and family structures and reduction of social disadvantage, must be addressed as part of any considered response to the deterioration in our communities.

Anti-social behaviour results in the destruction of community facilities, the undermining of law and order and the generation of fear in householders, especially the elderly. However, the Green Party does not believe that anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) address the real issues behind such behaviour and supports alternative responses to Asbos.

Education

The Green Party is strongly committed to investment in our education system on a lifelong basis from early development through to adult education. We believe that failure to invest in education leads to serious inequalities in society which, in the long-term, lead to suffering for all, whether through increased taxes, an increased crime rate or a reduction in our economic potential.

Budgetary constraints due to the current economic downturn mean that in this area, in particular, we have had to accept cuts which are highly unpalatable. The Green Party has worked hard in government to mitigate the effects of these cuts as much as possible.

Although local authorities do not have overall authority in the area of education, they nonetheless contribute in many ways to the educational environment in their local area.

At work in your community... Councillor Mark Dearey set up a drugs advisory group in Dundalk. This has brought service providers together and has made a real impact in dealing with the drug problem in Dundalk.

Health

The Green Party recognises that what is most important in keeping us healthy for most of our life is not the health service but how we live. Our community and environment can help us or hinder us in choosing a healthy lifestyle. Although health does not fall under the remit of local authorities per se, they play a major role in shaping the environment in which we live through planning decisions, housing, transport, water and sanitation and as such have a vital role to play in helping people to live healthy lives and in working with the health services to help people recover from illness.

At work in your community... Councillor Niall O Brolchain when he served as mayor of Galway city was instrumental in having Galway designated a World Health Organisation (WHO) healthy city

Arts and culture
The Green Party believes that the arts and culture are key facets in building a strong sense of community and identity.

Built heritage
The Green Party believes that the scale of development in Ireland in the recent past has created a need for action to protect Ireland’s valuable stock of built heritage.

Equality
One of the key aims of the Green Party is to provide for the inclusion of all members of society, both socially and economically, thereby enhancing everybody’s quality of life. We are therefore committed to working towards equality in all aspects of our business both internally and externally. We do so by actively discouraging all forms of discrimination and social injustice as they occur and by ensuring that all barriers to participation in our endeavours are removed as appropriate. We actively seek to accommodate diversity and we work towards achieving equal outcomes across the nine grounds covered under equality legislation; gender, marital status, family status, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion and membership of the Travelling community.

Housing is one of the main areas in which local authorities can promote equality. However, there is a wide range of actions in other areas, which local authorities can take in conjunction with other agencies through city and county development boards.

Creating closer communities

In brief…
• Community development is fundamental to the creation of better communities that offer a good quality of life.
• Local authorities have a significant role to play in creating better communities through good planning and the provision of housing, community spaces and inclusive services.

Growing greener communities

The Green Party has long supported a ‘green lifestyle’ with the least impact on natural resources, in recognition of the fact that this is the only way to sustain our environment, our economy and ultimately, our society. We have seen the impact of climate change in terms of environmental and humanitarian disasters as well as its effects on the global economy. There is no longer an alternative option; we must change direction and choose a greener path or face dire consequences.

Transition to a low-carbon, green economy and society begins at local level; in fact, it begins with each one of us.

Local authorities are well-placed to facilitate this change through planning policy and the operation of their services, which largely dictate the extent to which individuals can switch to a greener lifestyle.

Climate change

Ireland’s obligations with regard to climate change are guided by international, European and national commitments, including the Kyoto protocol, the EU’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), and our own national climate change strategy.

Local authorities can have a significant influence over climate change in their local areas, both directly through reduction of their own energy-use emissions and procurement activities; awareness-raising and stimulation of action in local communities; and indirectly through the exercise of their housing, planning and other statutory functions.

CO2 emissions could be drastically reduced with existing technologies through a combination of energy efficiency in housing, locally-based renewable energy generation, waste recovery, food production and a reduced need to travel, all of which can be facilitated to a large extent by local authorities.

Because of the influence that local authorities have on this highly important area, they are encouraged through the above instruments to develop climate change strategies and to adopt climate change proofing across all of their operations.

The environment

Irish implementation of EU environmental legislation to date is one of the worst in Europe. A significant proportion of environment-related complaints to the European Commission come from Irish citizens. The complaints against Ireland cover many issues including failure to control illegal waste activities, decline in water quality, heritage sites under attack from development and lack of or poor environmental and social impact assessments. While the Environmental Protection Agency acts as the ultimate environmental management body in Ireland, the implementation and enforcement of most environmental legislation rests with local authorities.

At work in your community...Green members of Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council successfully campaigned for the introduction of local climate change strategies for an incinerator in Galway city.

At work in your community...Councillor Niall O Brolchain campaigned for and succeeded in getting Ireland’s first three-bin domestic waste collection system up and running in Galway city. The introduction of a brown bin for food waste was a first for Ireland. Galway has consistently led the way in recycling rates achieving a domestic recycling rate of more than 50%. All domestic food waste is composted in a purpose-built municipal composting facility in Carrowbrowne and the compost is then spread on the city’s parks. This work led to changed public perception about the need for an incinerator in Galway.

Waste

The Green Party believes that waste should be minimised first and foremost through reduction followed by reuse and then recycling. Local authorities can become leaders in this area and set an example to local business by ensuring that the amount of waste they themselves produce is reduced to an absolute minimum.

The reuse of materials by local authorities in house-building and infrastructural projects could also make a significant local impact on the amount of waste for disposal. Finally, a strict recycling system within all local authorities would not only reduce the amount of waste for landfill but also encourage local business growth in the recycling sector.

Water

The Green Party recognises the paramount importance of water as a vital natural resource which needs strong protection to ensure its continued supply. For this reason, Minister John Gormley has invested heavily in the national water infrastructure and funding in this area has now reached record levels. The Green Party believes this area has been under-resourced for years but proper funding at central level will now produce an impact at local level. Although water supply is controlled at national level, local authorities have a significant input into the delivery of water services locally with regard to fresh drinking water and sewage treatment.

At work in your community... Councillors David Healy, Joe Corr and Robert Kelly successfully campaigned to put high energy standards into local area plans in Fingal County Council. The standards achieved were for 60% less energy usage in new houses. The local area plans also contained a requirement for a certain amount of green energy to be used. This has since led to a major change in national legislation with the introduction of the building energy rating (BER) scheme Local authorities can play a significant role in increasing food security by encouraging more locally grown food with provisions for allotments, community gardens and urban vegetable growing.

Energy

The Green Party believes that this country’s energy supply must move away from carbon to new and clean sources, not only to tackle climate change both nationally and globally but also to reduce our high dependence on imported fossil fuels, a dependence which drains our economy and leaves us in a weakened position with regard to fuel and food security. For this reason, Minister Eamon Ryan has invested substantially in renewable energy research and development. In the long-term, this investment will decrease our dependence on expensive imported fossil fuels thereby improving our economy through lowered production costs and the creation of indigenous jobs.

In local government, Green Party councillors have succeeded in encouraging some local authorities to conduct energy audits and switch to green electricity; and have also lobbied for greater energy conservation in new buildings.

At work in your community... Councillors Gene Feighery, Ruairi Holohan, Terence Corish and Tom Kivlehan ensured that all electricity used in Council buildings in DunLaoghaire-Rathdown is now from 100 per cent renewable sources.

Grow your own food

The Green Party believes that local food growth forms an important component of a healthy community. For this reason, we recently launched a campaign to ‘get Ireland growing’ (for more details see www.getgrowing.ie.)

We support more organic and local food production in an effort to reduce wasteful transportation, provide local employment, and strengthen links between producers and consumers – an integral part of reducing our climate change emissions and increasing food security. We therefore encourage local authorities to support local food growing initiatives.

In brief…
• Green communities are strong communities.
• The Green Party believes that a ‘green lifestyle’ with the least impact on natural resources is the only way to sustain not only our environment but also our economy and ultimately our society.
• The impact of climate change on our economy, society and environment is now vividly apparent. There is no longer an alternative option; we must change direction and choose a greener path or face dire consequences economically, socially and environmentally.
• Transition to a low-carbon, green society begins with individuals and the communities in which they live.

This recession has touched every community in Ireland. In every town, village, suburb and city, job losses, failing businesses, pay cuts and cutbacks are taking their toll.

In this economic crisis, leadership is vital. At national, and at local government level, we need decisive and imaginative action to stem job losses and to get our economy moving again. And we need a new, more democratic citizenship, based on fairness and respect.

To succeed, we must act together, as a community. The burden of getting our country back on its feet must be shared fairly, with everyone contributing according to their ability to do so. This collective effort should not simply be measured in monetary terms, but also by what we are willing to give back to our country and our communities, in the form of time, energy and shared commitment, be it social, sporting or cultural.

Local government can be a vehicle for change in our communities, our quality of life, and our democracy. Local government shapes communities. For Labour councillors, good local government means good quality housing, clean streets, safe parks, playgrounds and playing pitches, thriving businesses and a healthy environment. It means making our communities the best possible places to grow up and grow old in.

For the past twelve years, a Fianna Fáil-led Government has allowed speculative developers to dictate how our communities should look, work and play. It is time to take back control over our own future, and that of our children.

The Labour Party wants to put local people at the heart of local government. We want to empower people to contribute to the social, economic and civic life of their communities, so that they shape the place where they live.

Labour Councillors are ready to take action in their communities. And they are asking you to join them.

LOCAL ECONOMY, LOCAL JOBS

Local authorities have a role to play in boosting the local economy, and stimulating the creation of local jobs. From promoting incentives that encourage start-up companies, to using their purchasing power to help create jobs, active local authorities can prove that there are local solutions to global problems.

Labour councillors will:

Encourage the creation of local jobs through a new Rate Increment Scheme, which would allow new start up businesses to pay a discounted rate base over a specified period of time.

Explore how libraries can be used as local resource centres for people who are unemployed, and looking for information on local jobs, training and CV or job-seeking advice.

Help mobilise VECs to provide retraining opportunities for those who have lost their jobs. We will explore how further education institutions can best respond to the needs of their local communities through, for example:

a local analysis of the skills needs of people signing onto the live register

Extended night-time and weekend opening hours

Extend the remit of County Development Boards to act as local jobs and training taskforces. This local taskforce would bring all local education and training providers, local chambers of commerce and local FAS offices together to coordinate an urgent response to local unemployment.

Make sure the Council budget prioritises labour-intensive investment to help create local jobs.

Establish a Socio-Economic Development Programme in every local authority.

Encourage every Local Authority to have a tourism strategy, incorporating the quality of accommodation, signage, visitor facilities, visitor attractions, heritage, eco, arts and sports tourism potential, and the cleaning and maintenance of streets and roadsides to ensure they are as attractive as possible.

Advocate that the details of companies who successfully bid for local authority-funded contracts be published on its website. As well as being fully transparent, it would allow companies looking for sub-contracting opportunities to know who to approach.

Publish an annual breakdown of how rates that are levied on business are spent, so that local businesses know they are getting value for money. This information would be sent to businesses along with their rates bill.

The Rural Economy

The rural economy provides, directly and indirectly, a total of 230,000 Irish jobs. Local authorities can work in partnership with the agri-business sector to sustain the agricultural industry and our rural society in an increasingly competitive global economy.

Labour councillors will:

Encourage and foster farmers markets, to incentivise farmers to diversify into local-need agriculture and horticultural produce. More locally produced produce would create micro economies in rural areas, keeping money and investment within the local economy.

Encourage farmers to set aside some land, which can be rented out as garden allotments.

Support partnerships between local authorities and farmers to provide Community Supported Agriculture, for example on land that is not in use by the local authority.

A national jobs and training strategy

At national level, Labour wants to:

Mobilise our education and training system to meet the re-training needs of the unemployed. This includes:

Introducing a new work and training initiative called ‘Earn and Learn’, which would enable people to work two or three days a week, and be paid to train for the remaining days.

A Graduate and Apprentice Job Placement Scheme, where new graduates and trainees can receive the equivalent of a Jobseeker’s payment while undertaking an internship.

Reducing the waiting period for eligibility for Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to 3 months.

Enabling unemployed people who want to go back to education, and who are funding their own studies, to claim back up to two years of their income tax.

Lifting the cap on places in Further Education colleges.

Using spare capacity in our universities and Institutes of Technology for re-training opportunities.

Providing training to equip people to find employment in the emerging Environmental Goods and Services Sector.

Incentivise job creation through a temporary PRSI exemption for employers who have filled a new job with a person who has been unemployed for more than 6 months.

Incentivise career breaks and flexible work options to facilitate parents, carers or others who want to take time out of the workforce.

Generate green jobs through a major home insulation scheme.

Redraw the National Development Plan to prioritise labour-intensive investment. We can begin with a nationwide programme of school building and refurbishment to improve the quality and energy efficiency of our schools.

Re-tool our industrial policy to preserve skilled jobs, even when the original employer has left the country.

Create a Universal Service Obligation (USO) for broadband, to ensure a high quality, universal broadband network.

Expand the function and job creation capacities of County Enterprise Boards, and give greater discretion to these CEBs to contribute to employment creation, including raising the threshold on the number of jobs that they can support.

PLANNING FOR A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE

Labour would put an end to developer-led planning, and put the needs of people and the environment at the heart of how we grow our communities.

Labour councillors take seriously our responsibility to plan for safe, sociable and sustainable communities, and not just houses, estates and apartments.

Labour councillors will:

Ensure that housing estates are taken in charge in a timely manner by strongly enforcing existing rules.

Incorporate transport provisions into city and council development plans.

Encourage clustered rural and urban regeneration to provide sustainable communities.

Provide a one-stop shop facilitating local residents who want to contribute to the planning process.

Consult with local communities in advance of drawing up local development plans.

Maximise the public green spaces belonging to the local authority for recreational use.

Promote allotments through the planning system, and by examining how under-utilised land might be used for this purpose.

Enforce existing legislation to enhance access to public buildings for people with disabilities.

Disability-proof services and facilities provided by the Local Authority or its contractors, such as waste and recycling services, recreational facilities, walk ways and pavement repairs.

Promote high-quality, sustainable design through Councils’ procurement process.

Initiate pilot projects that will involve community stakeholders in developing designs for future landmark buildings, street furniture and common shop fronts.

At national level, Labour wants to:

Require planning permission for housing estates to be linked to the provision of schools, public transport, healthcare, community centres, recreational areas and sources of local employment.

Require permission for big commercial developments to be linked to public transport provision.

Strengthen legislation to refuse future planning permission to developers who have failed to finish off housing developments in the past.

Substantially increase existing enforcement penalties for those who break planning laws.

Ensure consistent application of planning laws across local authorities.

Tighten restrictions on sale of public land and enable Local Authorities to preserve green spaces.

Amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to require a flood risk report to be carried out as part of the preparation of County and City Development Plans.

Prioritise capital investment in flood relief measures, and legislation that requires local authorities to manage flood risk through sustainable planning and development.

Transport and Traffic

How we get around is central to our quality of life. Most of us spend at least part of our day in gridlock – including those who take public transport.

Many parts of the country have no access to public transport at all. And the public transport we do have is patchy, and doesn’t join up. The result? Our streets and roads are congested, dangerous, slow and dirty: frustrating for motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and bus users alike.

Labour councillors will:

Advocate that local authorities in rural areas facilitate the establishment of local transport services, such as daytime services for elderly people, and late night ‘disco buses’ at weekends.

Promote park and ride facilities for commuters.

Eliminate bottlenecks and gaps in bus lanes.

Introduce lower speed limits in residential areas.

Expand the number of safe, high quality cycle lanes.

Ensure schools have secure cycle stands, and a tailored ‘Safe Cycle to School’ route.

Increase the number of secure cycle racks around the local authority area.

Take action to enhance the safety of cyclists on the roads.

Promote the use of local ‘walking buses’ for children to enable them to walk to school safely.

Ensure coastal local authorities have an effective harbour policy.

At national level, Labour wants:

To create regional and city transport authorities, whose responsibilities would include managing traffic flows, procuring, funding and operating joined-up public transport projects, integrated ticketing, and real-time bus information.

A reversal in the cuts to Bus Eireann and Dublin Bus services. Investment in additional and improved bus services is the most flexible, affordable and timely way to provide more people with the opportunity to use public transport instead of a car.

Formal coordination of coastal zone management and protection policies between coastal authorities, including those north of the border

HOUSING

Labour believes that everyone has the right to decent, safe and affordable housing. This is true whether a person owns their own home, or is renting in the public or private sector. And we have practical suggestions to make this a reality.

Labour councillors will:

Limit the time a tenant of a local authority house has to wait for a repair or modification of their home to three months. This could be done through the creation of a fund to purchase repairs privately, where the local authority has failed to provide the service within three months.

Encourage the expansion of an ‘empty nester’ downsizing scheme, which allows older people to sell their homes to the council, and be re-housed in more suitable accommodation.

Privilege the ownership of social housing by the local authority over long-term renting of accommodation.

Ensure that 10% of all housing is suitable for people with a disability.

Support ring-fenced funding for the homeless, based on a local assessment of local needs.

Advocate that every local authority area has a local strategy to eliminate homelessness.

Promote supported housing, backed up with appropriate funding, to help people at risk of homelessness to stay in their homes.

At national level, Labour wants:

To increase the stock of social housing through the purchase of suitable unsold houses and apartments from developers at cost price, and to transfer development land from Anglo Irish Bank for affordable housing purposes.

To progress the regeneration of social housing.

To end the use of private management companies and charges in private housing estates as a precondition of planning permission, and regulate them for apartments.

To introduce a “Right to Buy” policy, which would extend the Tenant Purchase Scheme to tenants of local authority apartments.

Local authorities to be empowered, and resourced, to regulate standards in private rental accommodation.

The Private Residential and Tenancies Board to act as an ‘honest broker’ between tenants and landlords in the private rental sector, through the establishment of a rental deposit scheme.

To ring-fence the new property registration tax of €200 for use within the local authority where the property is situated.

The return of the home security scheme for rural senior citizens.

ENVIRONMENT

Climate Change

The challenge posed by global warming is immense, and it can sometimes feel overwhelming. But there are many things we can do at local level that allow us to play our part in reducing harmful greenhouse gases, while saving money and improving our quality of life.

Labour councillors will:

Enable local authorities to facilitate voluntary group insulation schemes. If a group of neighbours in similar houses want to retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient, they can contact each other through the local authority. Their local authority would act as a link between the residents and an energy services company, which would design a one-size-fits-all package of measures suitable for that type of house, reducing the cost and hassle of retrofitting.

Ensure every local authority has a strategy to reduce carbon emissions in its area, including a transport plan that maximises cycling, walking, car pooling and public transport.

Incorporate micro-generation of heat and electricity in new residential and commercial developments into Area Development Plans where appropriate, so that new developments can produce some of their energy needs themselves.

Require the local authority to conduct an energy audit of its own properties, to assess how best to reduce its energy usage, and to pilot renewable energy schemes, such as solar panels, in its own buildings.

Promote the planting of urban forests.

At national level, Labour wants:

To facilitate a national home insulation scheme, with accountable and approved contractors, to create green jobs and reduce our carbon footprint.

To include the installation of renewable technologies in the Warmer Homes Scheme

To ensure Local Authorities have sufficient trained building inspectors to enforce energy efficiency regulations.

A national climate change adaptation strategy as a matter of urgency. Every local authority should be given clear guidelines to develop their own climate change adaptation plan, and be required to implement it.

A National Climate Change Forum that would involve all stakeholders, including local government, to generate a national consensus on the measures we need to take to meet existing and future greenhouse gas reduction obligations.

Waste

Waste is a growing problem we cannot afford to ignore. We produce too much of it, recycle too little, and are running out of places to put it.

Just focusing on how we dispose of waste will not solve the problem: we need to focus on creating less waste in the first place, and recycling. Labour wants to use our waste to create jobs. We want to establish a home-grown recycling industry, which would see us process recyclable waste here, and kickstart a market for recycled goods.

We can start by providing incentives for people to reduce packaging and waste, and to increase the amount they recycle.

Labour councillors want a fair, sustainable, joined up waste policy. This includes:

Pricing waste collection so as to promote recycling.

A price structure for waste collection based on weight.

An expansion in door to door collection of organic waste.

More bring centres, composting facilities and local schemes that incentivise the return of used bottles and cans.

At national level, Labour wants:

A nation-wide waiver scheme for domestic waste charges for low-income households in every local authority.

The establishment of a National Recycling Agency, charged with setting up a recycling industry in Ireland.

Water

Everyone has the right to free, clean, safe drinking water. The scandal of unsafe drinking water in Galway in 2007, which had serious health consequences, should never have happened, and must never be repeated. Local authorities have a duty to ensure that water infrastructure keeps pace with housing development.

Labour councillors will:

Urge Local Authorities to develop strategic water plans for their area, to make sure there is sufficient capacity to meet demand.

Oppose moves to privatise the public water supply or to introduce domestic water charges.

Use existing legislation to require developers to make a contribution towards investment in water infrastructure, as part of their planning permission.

Ensure the timely preparation of River Basin Management Plans, which are required under the Water Framework Directive.

Seek to ensure that all waste water treatment plants have a Phosphates Control Plan.

At national level, Labour wants:

Sufficient funding and staffing for local authorities to ensure compliance with the EU Waste Water Treatment Directive.

Pollution

Labour believes present and future generations deserve to live in a healthy environment with clean water, fresh air and a rich abundance of wildlife and fauna.

Labour councillors will:

Strongly enforce existing legislation on environmental crime, such as illegal dumping and graffiti.

Step up enforcement of laws against dog fouling, and ensure better provision of bins for this purpose.

Ensure Local Authorities fully enforce existing regulations and laws dealing with noise pollution, and enable them to mediate noise-related disputes between neighbours.

Encourage every Local Authority to have a Biodiversity Officer and prepare local biodiversity plans.

At national level Labour wants to:

Bring in legislation to implement the Environmental Liability Directive, in order to hold those whose actions cause damage to the environment to account.

Ratify the Aarhus Convention and implement the European Union Public Participation Directive to give citizens the right to access information, to public participation and to justice in environmental matters.

Harness the high level of interest shown by Irish school pupils in environmental issues, as demonstrated in OECD studies, by increasing the number of learning activities in the science curricula that relate to the environment, climate change and biodiversity.

RECREATION AND AMENITIES

Children and Young People

Local authorities have the power to make their communities better places to grow up in. Our aim is to make our communities, wherever they may be, the best places to bring up a family.

Labour councillors will:

Work with schools to explore how local authorities could manage safe supervised community facilities, open before and after school, for parents to drop and collect their children on their way to and from work.

Enable local authorities to act as brokers for parents seeking to set up childcare cooperatives

Promote the expansion of playgrounds, particularly in or close to young communities.

Facilitate the use of libraries by parent and toddler groups.

Ensure greater monitoring of playgrounds and parks by park wardens to combat anti-social behaviour.

Promote ‘night basketball’ and ‘night football’, as well as other sports and recreation facilities, to give teenagers other options for socialising.

Encourage local authorities to engage with youth and community groups to provide youth cafés.

At national level, Labour wants:

An arts, cultural and sports based summer recreation programme for young people, run at local government level. This would be coordinated by a full-time youth recreation coordinator, and staffed in part by third level students employed under a revived Summer Jobs Scheme.

Older people

Labour councillors want to establish a Senior Citizen Forum in every Local Authority Electoral Area, which would give our seniors the opportunity to give their views on matters that affect them. For example:

Better public transport facilities.

Options for socialising locally, such as active retirement clubs.

Personal security.

Learning Communities

Through libraries, and the links between local authorities and Vocational Educational Committees, local government has played an important role in the provision of education in the community and the promotion of Life Long Learning. Labour will expand the role of local government in education, as it is the key to building a sustainable economy and enabling people of all ages to reach their full potential.

Labour councillors will:

Propose the establishment of Local Education Forums to facilitate discussion between local representatives, school boards, parents and council management, and to plan effectively for the needs of schools in the area.

Work to achieve the goals of Labour’s Right to Read campaign. This includes:

Advocating that local authorities provide homework clubs, run by Community Development Workers.

Ensuring future social housing takes account of children’s need to have a quiet space to do their homework.

Encouraging literacy among young parents with the promotion of ‘Baby Books Bundle’ through the local library service.

Extending library opening hours and outreach services.

Introducing more ‘Family Learning Through Football’ schemes, which encourage positive parenting and family literacy.

A greater roll-out of schemes like Dublin City Council’s ‘Beano Comic Initiative’.

Work to mobilise VEC colleges of further education to meet the retraining needs of those who have been made unemployed.

Facilitate the provision of outreach centres that link up to third level institutions, and facilitate distance or online learning, where available.

Work with VECs and Institutes of Technology to provide training opportunities for local authority employees, to help equip them for their roles in public service delivery.

Libraries

Labour councillors will:

Advocate that libraries remain open six days a week, and extend evening opening hours.

Ensure all libraries publish community outreach plans, and work with schools and community groups to maximise participation in library services by all age groups.

Work to expand the mobile library service, and to provide outreach hubs of libraries in community buildings.

Facilitate libraries to become community resource centres for the arts and education, as well as hubs for those seeking localised advice on job-seeking and employment opportunities.

Healthy Communities

Labour councillors will:

Promote the development of ‘Green Gyms’ in public parks and green spaces.

Promote the development of non-profit walking and jogging clubs.

Art and Culture

Labour councillors will:

Encourage local artists and help regenerate communities by facilitating artists to exhibit in the windows of vacant retail premises, possibly in return for renovating and repainting the shop front to make it more appealing to potential investors.

Actively support the arts in their local area, through providing accommodation for the arts where possible, supporting local festivals, and working with the local arts industry to develop cultural tourism opportunities.

Provide more exhibition space in community and civic buildings.

Local History and Heritage

Labour councillors will:

Encourage the publication of local histories, and histories of the county.

Celebrate the lives of famous inhabitants of the county, both past and present, who have made a distinguished contribution, in the naming of landmarks.

Promote the placing of plaques on historic buildings of local importance.

Encourage every Local Authority to explore how it can best showcase its historical heritage for tourism, for example through the development of ‘historical quarters’.

Preserve the character and heritage of historic villages by preparing Village Design Statements that would inform future planning and development in and around those villages


Community Spirit

Labour councillors will:

Encourage local authorities to provide information about local volunteering opportunities, for example through their website.

Promote the development of family-friendly street festivals.

Promote North-South cooperation and stronger international links through town twinning, cultural exchanges and local inter-community activities.

Ensure local authority policy making is underpinned by the need for social inclusion.

Hold events that promote our increasingly multicultural society, and encourage integration and inclusion in local communities.

Safer Communities

Labour councillors will:

Prevent the development of anti-social behaviour ‘black spots’ by planning for safe and well-lit public spaces.

Promote, in addition to Joint Policing Committees, local policing forums at neighbourhood level to reconnect local people to their local Garda.

Enable local authorities to play a role in community mediation to resolve disputes between neighbours before they escalate.

Ensure the effective enforcement of Council bye-laws that relate to anti-social behaviour, such as the possession or consumption of alcohol, or the use of public spaces.

LOCAL DEMOCRACY

The best people to plan and manage local services, such as planning for the environment and housing, the amenities that make our local community work, schools, transport, policing, and care for the young and elderly, should be the locals who use them.

However, local people have very little say in the services that affect their everyday lives. Labour wants to radically overhaul local government, so that it is more democratic, more efficient and delivers better value for money.

Local Government Reform

Labour has published the most comprehensive blueprint for a modern system of local government.

To make local government more efficient, Labour is proposing:

A more sensible approach to delivering public services. If a function of government, such as building schools, employment services or the distribution of National Lottery Funds, can be done better, quicker and cheaper at local level, then it should be transferred to local government.

To do this effectively, we need two levels of local government, with powers appropriate to the scale of their remit:

City or Regional Authorities, charged with strategic planning for their city/region, transport and traffic, economic development. Other functions, like education, could also be delivered on a regional basis.

Local Authorities (including County, Town, and District Councils) would retain their existing functions, with other appropriate functions to be devolved over time.

The exemption of State-owned property from rates should be abolished. There is no justification for exempting State property from the rates regime which applies to privately-owned business.

The transfer of functions from central to local government should be accompanied by an appropriate redistribution of funding and redeployment of staff.

To make local government more democratic, Labour wants:

A directly elected mayor for every major city or city-region.

Councils to have a consumer protection role in the public service remit of private sector service providers. Councils should also be able to question, in a public forum, public service providers, like school managers.

Democratic accountability to be returned to local councillors. The County Manager should be abolished and replaced with Chief Executive with a limited range of executive functions.

The voting age in local elections to be reduced to 16, so that teenagers have more of a say in local services.

Local government that serves the people: what Labour Councillors will do

Labour Councillors will:

Open more decision-making to the public, for example, through the use of county or city-wide referendums.

Champion a binding Citizen Service Charter, which ensures Councils respond efficiently to queries.

Encourage every Council to have a ‘Spot and Report’ facility on its website and a dedicated phone hotline, which allows local residents to report repairs relevant to the local authority, for example, potholes, graffiti, dangerous pavements etc.

Advocate that all local authorities publish a user-friendly annual breakdown of how their income was spent.

Promote the involvement of local community groups and residents’ associations, and facilitate the formal recognition of residents’ associations under the Local Government Act 2001.

Ensure that all policy decisions are taken in plenary session.

Promote e-democracy. For example, we will ensure all Council meetings are broadcast live over the web, and that the maximum amount of information that is relevant to local residents will be published regularly on Council websites.

Ensure that residents who feel they have been treated unfairly by their Council are fully informed of their right to refer their complaint to the Ombudsman.

Advocate that every local authority would have a disability officer, and that all staff receive disability awareness training.

Ensure that we protect the human rights and dignity of those whom we represent, particularly with regard to housing, education and health services.

"Local 2009: Sinn Fein","People’s patience and belief in politics and politicians have been sorely tested by the scandalous mismanagement of the economy, decades of unchecked corruption and by the fact there has been little difference in the policies implemented by the main parties – Fianna Fail and Fine Gael in particular.

 ‘Why Vote Sinn Féin?’ 
For decades, Sinn Féin elected representatives have provided the highest quality of leadership and advocacy for their local communities. They are known for their dedication, for integrity and ethics, for innovation and for delivering change to the communities they represent. And we take the public trust embodied by your vote very seriously. 

But when you vote Sinn Féin it is more than an endorsement of a particular individual. You vote for a vision of how things could be different. How things could be better for you and your family in your local area. We know that not all communities are treated equally in this country and not all people are treated equally within their communities. We want to change all that. 

The mismanagement of the economic boom is now apparent for all to see. And every day you live with similar impacts from the neglect and mismanagement of local government – whether it’s ongoing water crises in Galway and Clare, the commuter bottlenecks caused by inefficient transport provision from Navan to Dublin, the broken and dangerous roads in country areas, the lack of support for those trying to create new jobs and set up enterprises within their own communities, the high level of rates local business are forced to pay as cash strapped local authorities seek to raise funds in one of the only ways they are permitted, the developments left unfinished or planned without access to essential local services, the one in seven homes that remain empty while tens of thousands remain on housing waiting lists state-wide, or the areas in every city and county where children still don’t have a safe place to play. 

But good decisions in local government can make a positive difference in your daily life. Imagine electing someone who will fight for the services your community deserves and has a right to. Who is committed to work with local entrepreneurs, trade unions, farmers and fishermen to create new jobs and make every community’s economy vibrant again . 

Who will stand up to the big developers and landlords and do everything possible to ensure that everyone in your community has a decent place to live. Who is willing to hold the local Gardaí accountable for making your community safer. Who will ensure that you have the opportunity to participate directly in decisions that affect you and your family. 

People need to exercise maximum control over their daily lives. This is true of Ireland as a nation and it is true of its local communities. Distant decisions, inappropriate, inefficient and ineffective one-size-fits-all ‘solutions’ must become a thing of the past. Strategic coordination and minimum standard-setting is important. But to be genuinely effective, planning and service delivery must be guided by local knowledge. Communities must be freed and empowered to each realise their unique potential. 

So Sinn Féin is about building and leading sustainable, strong, mobilised, healthy, prosperous and dynamic communities where no individual is left behind. And we are about building a national network of such communities, based on equality, such that no community is left behind. 
And that is what I am asking you to vote for when you vote Sinn Féin on June 5 th . Bígí linn.

Promoting Meaningful Local Democracy 

Republicanism is about maximising democratic rights. In former times, this meant campaigning for no taxation without representation and one person-one vote. In our generation, it is still about the right to Irish national self-determination, but it is also about promoting meaningful local democracy and full accountability in public service provision. 
What we have now in this state is local government stifled by limited powers, underfunding, corruption and a lack of vision. Business in local government must be done differently. Local councils should be centres of community innovation and dynamism. They should be engines for growing and spreading prosperity and equality. They should be where the community’s best and brightest come together to deliver responsive services and to solve problems cooperatively, efficiently and effectively. Moreover council halls and chambers are the property of the people.  Council business affects everyone, everyday.  Both should be inclusive of and accessible to all. 
New challenges from climate change to the global financial crisis show us that the maxim to think globally but act locally has never been more relevant to Ireland than in the 21st century.  Sinn Féin is ready to step up to the mark and to lead. 
In each area of local policy, we have identified fundamental changes for which we will campaign, but also priorities to guide our political action within current local powers over the lifetime of the next council administrations. 

Local Government Reform 

Local government in the 26 Counties has a much narrower range of powers and functions than most other EU states. There is no real local control over most essential public services or economic development.  This is bad for democracy and needs to change. In particular, the current system effectively prevents communities and their local public representatives from responding adequately to changes in economic circumstances, yet help from central level is rarely sufficient. Local councillors’ roles in policy making are too limited and many very important decisions are made instead by unelected and unaccountable Council Managers or by distant Ministers. Indeed, the Minister for the Environment currently has the power to override the democratic will of the people and dissolve a local council. All of this in turn constrains the ability of ordinary people to exert influence over the decisions that affect them every day. 
We need to take control over matters of local importance back from distant or unelected decision-makers and put them into local hands. 
In the Six Counties, Sinn Féin is spearheading a comprehensive and progressive reforming of local government and the widening of local powers and public accountability for services. What we really need is for this to become an island-wide reform initiative. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  A major transformation of local government, to empower local communities, increase participatory democracy and otherwise enable the delivery of planning and public services that correspond to local need.  
»  Increase councillors’ powers to include appropriate local control over the provision of services including education, healthcare, policing, infrastructure, investment and employment, childcare and social services, as well as greater local control over budgets and financing of local government, including the ability to collect tax revenue.  
»  Correspondingly limit Ministers’ powers. In particular, remove the power to dissolve local councils for failure to agree a budget.  
»  Restore or increase prior councillors’ powers over planning, housing, transportation and waste management and correspondingly limit Managers’ powers. In particular, remove their powers to impose incineration or superdumps and introduce privatisation of waste management services against the will of the local council.  
»  Reform the structure of local government to make it more accountable – including directly elected Chairs and Mayors who would assume many aspects of the council management oversight role.  
»  Review the powers and functions of councils’ Special Policy Committees and Community Development Boards to ensure that these allow for maximum participation and effectiveness.  
»  Introduce mechanisms for real community participation in local decision-making and ensure communities and their representative organisations are at the very least meaningfully consulted on major decisions affecting them. Support the establishment of District, Community and Neighbourhood Councils that can formally link with local authorities.  
»  Review the distribution of powers and division of labour between city/town/borough councils and county councils, ensure better integration through Area Committee work and reverse the unwarranted transfer of powers from town to county councils.  
»  Review the powers and functions of Regional Assemblies and Regional Authorities,5 and introduce direct elections to these bodies. Empower them to develop, implement and oversee coordinated regional policies on planning, environmental protection, economic development,  infrastructure and public service delivery. 
»  Build towards Irish Unity by increasing local, regional and cross-border coordination and integration of council work in development planning and service provision. Use participation on General Council of County Councils, Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, Local Authority Members’ Association and All-Ireland bodies to this effect. Work with northern colleagues on Cross-Border Corridor Groups to implement Integrated Area Plans for the three Border Corridor Areas (North West, Central and Eastern).  


Local Government Finance 

Underfunding of local government remains the biggest barrier to local authorities’ delivery of improved services in the communities they represent.  Central government provides some support through the Local Government Fund and grants for specific initiatives, but the level of finance is among the lowest in the EU at less than half the EU average. Councils struggle to balance their meagre budget allocations and inevitably some essential services suffer. 

Meanwhile, again in contrast to most other developed world counterparts, our local authorities’ powers to raise additional revenue are limited to the imposition of charges such as commercial rates, business charges, domestic charges and development charges and other user fees that amount to stealth taxes.  This means that cash strapped local authorities are often compelled to introduce or increase rates, charges and fees beyond what would otherwise be considered reasonable. For example, whereas previously local authority infrastructure projects were funded mainly through government grants, increasingly councils have to produce matching funds in order to qualify for such support. This policy effectively discriminates against less prosperous areas and will further aggravate uneven regional development, since local revenue may not be available for the capital infrastructure needed to increase local competitiveness and prosperity. 

The ability of local authorities to fund services is likely to worsen in the time ahead. In addition to the cuts introduced by central government to deal with the current Exchequer deficit, the downturn in the construction sector is already significantly affecting the amount of revenue local authorities now collect by way of development charges. 

All recent analyses of local government financing agree that the current system is failing. In particular, a major 2006 report by Indecon International Economic Consultants concluded that reform is essential and that a truly sustainable system enabling local authorities to provide services remains to be established. 

These challenging economic times also demand an end to local financial mismanagement. We need to take what resources we collectively own and share them out more equally to make our communities fairer, not less fair. 

Sinn Féin wants a future for local government characterised by increased powers matched with the increased revenue necessary to deliver needed services. We need sustainable funding for better local government. This requires reform of both local government funding and its financial management. 

Value for Money – The Republican Way 
Everybody rightly wants value for money.  More than that, governments spending hard earned tax revenue have a duty to ensure the best value in public spending. Using an effective ‘value for money’ test is essential to counter corruption and waste.  But for republicans, ‘value for money’ must measure more than just the direct costs and quality of goods and services and their timely delivery. ‘Value for money’ should under no circumstances be reduced to simple cost cutting or containment. We must hold public spending to an even higher standard. 
To achieve true value, public procurement decisions must also do the following: 
Take into account both long term and ‘external’ (indirect) costs. 
Not undermine fundamental social goals, such as protection of the environment or workers’ rights, or the achievement of economic equality – and if possible should enhance these. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  Make need the core principle in local government funding allocation. Central government spending on local government should be determined by the real needs of communities, the services local authorities are required to provide and their ability to raise additional revenue in an equitable manner locally.  
»  Progressively increase the proportion of central government funding transfers to local government commensurate with increased powers and service delivery needs.  
»  Increase local authorities’ budgetary control, including greater discretion in the spending of central grant funding.  
»  Phase out the archaic model of annual budgeting in favour of multi-annual budgeting based on long-term planning at both local government and central government levels.  
»  Introduce appropriate local participatory budgeting mechanisms such as those used successfully in more than 200 municipalities worldwide, to ensure full transparency and accountability in setting of rates and charges and in spending.  
»  End double-charging as a prop to a false ‘low tax’ system. The Commission on Taxation must bring forward proposals to ensure sustainable and equitable sources of tax revenue to enable government at all levels to improve quality and capacity in public services and to deliver the improvements in infrastructure that are necessary to restore economic competitiveness and improve quality of life for all.  

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Use the powers of elected representative oversight – including membership on Finance Special/Municipal Policy Committees and republican value for money criteria – to demand the accountable, efficient and effective spending of local authority finances. 
» Ensure that local public procurement (both current and capital and whether contracted-out or not) not only achieves value for money by conventional measures, but that winning bids are in full compliance with tax laws and environmental regulations, as well as labour law and good practice in areas including health, safety, equality, trade union recognition and collective bargaining. 
» Adjust local service and procurement contracts to create a level pitch for local businesses by breaking tenders into segments, allowing smaller contractors to efficiently tender. 
» Oppose privatisation of local authority services and the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). These do not represent value for money since they result in public revenue foregone and also place a long term cost on local authorities that will eat into future budgets.  Support local authorities’ return to the conventional tendering process. 
» Call for a review of the expenses regime for councillors and Committee Chairs to eliminate excess and abuse and subject claims to strict limits and scrutiny. 
» Support the exercise of wage restraint at the top grades within local authority management and work with the local representatives of public sector workers to oppose service cuts and ensure fair pay and conditions. 
» Oppose the imposition of double taxation through new service charges or user fees for essential public services. Instead fully investigate other possible sources of local public revenue. 
» Oppose increases in and ensure fair and equitable application of, existing fees and charges. 
» Press for consideration of the application of commercial rates based in part on the ability of businesses to pay – for example highly profitable businesses should be expected to pay more. 
» Ensure that local authorities are enabled to recoup the full costs of providing services to non-principal private homes. 
» Ensure that revenue raised through the introduction of any further environmental levies designed to reduce the production of waste or pollution (similar to the plastic bag levy) augment local government funds. 
» Press for review of the requirement for matching local funding for infrastructural projects, to address the concern that certain local authorities are unable to progress with much needed infrastructure that would help build prosperity and competitiveness because they do not have the ability to raise matching funds. 

Building Sustainable Communities 
Too many communities suffer as a result of bad planning. Too many people don’t have adequate or affordable housing – indeed an increasing number are homeless or living rough. This state shames the Irish people with its poor environmental record in the EU – with its contaminated water, its high carbon emissions, its far below average recycling infrastructure. 

What we need are communities that are well-planned, that provide good shelter for all, that respect and protect the environment. Without these solid foundations, no community can improve its quality of life, much less genuinely prosper. 

Sinn Féin is therefore committed to building a national network of sustainable communities that achieve these goals. This is at the heart of our political programme at local government level and we will use existing planning, housing, environmental protection and waste management powers in the councils to this end. 

Planning 
Good planning makes all the difference to community and family life.  Responsible, ethical and sustainable planning, underpinned by equality considerations, is the right of all who live in Ireland. Yet current Government policy favours wealthy developers, speculators and landowners over the rest of us. This has resulted in corruption and bad planning decisions and we cannot allow this to continue. 

We have all come across bad planning in the areas where we live and work. It denies us proper housing, schools and other public services and shopping, play and leisure facilities. It undermines public safety and a healthy environment. It can destroy whole communities and even cost lives. 

One effect of bad planning in combination with the housing crisis is that average and lower-income first time buyers have been pushed into so-called commuter towns that are poorly serviced by transportation infrastructure and childcare services – both of which are necessitated by long commutes for employment. Property developers must not be allowed to build new housing developments without taking into account the need for provision of basic facilities and amenities. At the same time, rural people have a right to build principal homes on their own family’s land and contribute to the regeneration of their own community. This can benefit all by reducing demand for and pressure on sub/ urban housing. 

To thrive as sustainable, all communities require essential physical and social infrastructure. Sinn Féin has developed ‘Sustainable Communities Criteria’ based on the delivery of economic and social rights. All planning decisions must meet these criteria before earning our support. 

Sinn Féin Sustainable Communities Criteria 

Each community must have reasonable local access to the following: 
» a sufficient supply of social and affordable housing, in mixed areas 
» safe water supply and adequate sewerage 
» public transportation 
» employment 
» healthcare centres 
» childcare centres and schools and reasonable access to local amenities such as: 
» shopping 
» public play and recreation areas 
» sports and leisure facilities 
» social and community centres, including youth cafés 
» cultural centres including libraries and museums, performance and exhibition spaces. 

Direct community involvement in the planning process can provide an additional safeguard against corruption and bad planning.  Local people are often better placed to inform decisions on community planning and management matters. We believe that many planning mistakes could be avoided if communities have a greater input in the planning process so that their needs are accounted for. People also have a right to participate in planning decisions that affect them. Yet the current system generally excludes local people from decision-making on planning.  We believe that local authorities should act in partnership with the affected local communities to ensure that their planning decisions meet the real needs of the people they represent. 
Sinn Féin elected representatives will use existing and campaign for additional planning powers to build communities that we all feel safe and proud to live in.  We will work to hold developers accountable and ensure that all areas have the infrastructure necessary to be socially and environmentally sustainable and moreover use planning policy to contribute to community safety, as well as urban and rural regeneration. 


Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  Long-term vision developed through a 10 year planning cycle with 3 mid-cycle reviews, commencing in 2011.  
»  Accountability in planning through the establishment of Community Planning Fora as a permanent mechanism for local consultation and participation.  
»  Extension and promotion of public Pre-Planning Clinics in every local council – maintaining a list of accredited local engineers – to offset unequal access to planning expertise.  
»  Increased staffing for Council Planning Units to reduce delays, including new out-of-hours Community Planning Enforcement Officers, funded by a fair levy on developers.  
»  Amendment of the Planning and Development Act to require at least 30% social and affordable housing in every new development.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Take an ethics pledge linked to an Elected Representatives Code of Conduct, as required by the party. 
» Use membership on the Planning Strategic/Municipal Policy Committees and otherwise advocate to ensure community participation and input at pre-planning and planning enforcement stages and extensive participation during all stages of County/City/Town/Local Area Development Planning. 
» Apply the ‘Sinn Féin Sustainable Communities Criteria’ and refuse to support unsustainable planning applications. 
» Ensure development plans make best use of existing space and focus on brownfield site development to promote both urban and rural regeneration. 
» Ensure proposed developments adhere to the (Dublin) Guidelines for Successful Apartment Living, the Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities urban design framework and the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines. 
» Ensure that planning permission favours the development of sustainable rural housing and that development levies do not penalise rural dwellers building family homes, or first-time buyers building modest principal homes. 
» Ensure development plans frontload building of community facilities, with onus on the developer. 
» Ensure development plans build safer communities by including youth amenities (ie. green areas, playgrounds/skateboard parks, sports and recreation centres, libraries and culture and arts spaces, youth cafés), as well as better road crossings and traffic calming schemes, improved street lighting and night transport initiatives.  
»  Target planning enforcements at big developers and ensure that planning enforcement resources are not misused on individual planning disputes between neighbours or insignificant breaches of conditions.  
»  For developments of a significant nature, size or scale, demand initial site notification and notification of any amendments to all resident within 400 yards of a site.  
Oppose approval for spurious ‘change of use’ applications (for example, to vary ‘non-viable’ crèches to income generating private units).  
»  Hold developers accountable by systematically imposing substantial, index-linked bonds (refundable in the event of full compliance with planning conditions) as provided for in the Planning and Development Act and by applying a bar from planning approval on those who fail to comply which includes both the parent company and subsidiaries. Ensure that development levies are paid on the granting of planning permission.  
»  Propose and insist on Irish names for new roads and estates, reactivate the use of townland names and ensure that all planning decisions protect our cultural heritage, including heritage sites.  

Housing 
First it was massive year-on-year house price inflation. Now that the housing bubble has burst, it is the credit crunch. Between these two, owning a home has never been less attainable for those on low and middle incomes. The housing crisis in this state may currently be overshadowed by the economic crisis, but it is no less real.  Moreover the economic crisis if not resolved will only aggravate the housing crisis further, as an increasing number are now at risk of mortgage default and repossession. 

Private management companies make matters worse where they operate in estates and apartment complexes. As the sector remains unregulated these companies can charge extortionate fees and annual hikes of up to 50% that residents – already saddled with hefty mortgages – have no choice but to pay. 

Those who rent privately are vulnerable to the approximately one in five rogue landlords who do not comply with minimum accommodation standards. Some are trapped in genuinely appalling conditions including rat infestations, dampness and mould, leaking water pipes and a lack of ventilation. Yet local authorities mostly fail to exercise with diligence their responsibility for inspecting all rental accommodation and bringing prosecutions for violations, at least in part because they lack sufficient resources.  Private tenants affected by the economic downturn are also increasingly at risk of illegal eviction. 

Sufficient social housing provision solves many of these problems. Yet both the state and local authorities are failing in their responsibility to step into the breach. 

Although social housing new build has increased in recent years, provision has not increased to the level required to cater for the more than 40,000 households who remain on waiting lists and indeed tenant purchases have depleted the public stock. The disastrous collapse of the Dublin Public-Private Partnership regeneration schemes proves that PPPs do not work and government should fund social housing from now on. 

According to the most recent estimates available, there are approximately 2,400 households and 5,000 individuals that are homeless. More than 1,700 households live in unfit accommodation. Over 4,000 households live in overcrowded accommodation and nearly 3,400 are involuntarily sharing. The number of individual adults and children affected is of course much greater. And it is widely understood that these figures significantly understate the actual situation. Meanwhile, more than one in six private houses built remain vacant. This represents unconscionable waste in the face of dire need. 

Social housing delivery is a key responsibility of local councils. Good housing decisions can make a difference.  Delivery of housing for all, as of right, is a major priority for Sinn Féin and we will use all existing and campaign for additional powers and resources to help achieve this objective. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  A reorientation of housing policy to favour public provision of social housing and increased provision of cost-price affordable housing.  
»  Public reporting of an annual local social housing needs assessment, alongside a report on the status of local housing stock (including local authority occupied, local authority vacant, local authority vacant but derelict, voluntary, affordable, vacant private and private rental) and public reporting of an annual survey of local homelessness.  
»  A review of all Local Authority Design Guides to establish a state-wide minimum standard to ensure that each follows best practice.  
»  A new regulated system for local assessment of social housing need, including provision for advocacy, multidisciplinary assessment, increased waiting list transparency and an appeals process.  
»  A new regulated system for allocation of affordable housing, based on need, including independent oversight and increased waiting list transparency.  
»  Increased resources for local authority inspections of rental accommodation, with a view to ensuring robust enforcement including prosecutions.  
»  Establishment of the promised Property Services Regulatory Authority to monitor these companies, enforce standards and investigate complaints.  
»  Government assistance to those currently at risk of losing their homes due to reckless banking practices, including:  
» increase of Mortgage Interest Supplement;  
» a requirement on banks to take all steps necessary to protect low income and unemployed people facing mortgage default and home reposession including rescheduling payments or allowing interest-only payments for a period of time;  
» establishment of a new payments scheme for newly unemployed mortgage holders in which interest payments are suspended until new employment is found; and  
» a moratorium on principal home repossessions for low and middle income homeowners until after the recession.  
»  An end to illegal evictions.  

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Use membership on the Housing Strategic/Municipal Policy Committees to work with the local Homeless Forum and other housing rights advocacy partners including Residents’ Associations. 
» Ensure the council sets and meets social housing targets and targets to eliminate homelessness within the Local Authority Housing Strategy and Homeless Action Plan, including a ringfenced percentage of allocations for homeless households. 
» Oppose dependence on private provision of social and affordable housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act in favour of public provision, but also ensure that developers at least meet the full 20% social and affordable housing provision minimum requirement under the law. Ensure that such housing is not clustered but spread throughout new estates. Ensure that councils purchase all of it, allocate at least 50% for social housing and sell the remainder as cost-price affordable housing. 
»  Propose the following basket of measures to immediately double social housing output without budgetary increase by:  
» Extending the new shared equity scheme to allow local authorities to purchase housing units on a 50:50 basis in conjunction with the central government and using this lending capacity to increase social housing output.  
» Combining local authority capital and revenue streams alongside government loans to build and acquire more social units.  
» Purchasing existing vacant private units at or below market value, subject to appropriate standards and value for money criteria.  
»  Ensure full use of compulsory purchase order (CPO) powers on derelict buildings and sites, as well as vacant properties and other lands to convert these to social housing on an accelerated basis.  
»  Ensure at a minimum unit-for-unit replacement of social housing, particularly as part of regeneration programmes.  
»  Oppose over-concentration/isolation of social housing and ensure housing provision for people with particular social needs within mixed tenure estates.  
»  Review the social housing points systems for equity to all social groups, to ensure fair allocations with preference to those most vulnerable.  
»  Work to end substandard social housing design – the prevalence of smaller units, smaller rooms, less garden space, less soundproofing between units – by ensuring application of the same design specifications to social housing units as to private housing units.  
»  Ensure adherence to all housing planning guidelines and propose state-wide extension of the Dublin Council Guidelines for Successful Apartment Living, especially for Part V new builds.  
»  Ensure new builds meet universal design standards, for example as set out by the Committee for European Standardisation Guidelines and energy efficiency standards including those set out by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  
»  Ensure that all local authority-owned properties benefit from Building Energy Rating (BER) upgrading and promote support for other sustainability upgrading, including energy efficiency/consumption reduction schemes and water use efficiency/water harvesting schemes, including maximum subsidy to low income households.  
»  Ensure that councils use their full powers of inspection of local rental accommodation, adhere to inspection and standards guidelines and engage in robust enforcement against rogue landlords.  
»  Ensure councils fulfill their own estate maintenance and refurbishment responsibilities and do not allow public properties to remain derelict.  
» Oppose outsourcing of estate management to private companies and renew an emphasis on/support for Residents’ Associations and cooperative management of estates. 


Environmental Protection and Waste Management 

To say that this state’s environmental record is poor is to understate the problem. It shows failure to meet carbon emissions reduction targets, failure to meet waste reduction and recycling targets, failure to protect boglands and wetlands and other sensitive habitats from development and exploitation, increased incidence of flooding as a consequence of failure to protect floodplains from development, consistent violations of EU standards on water quality. While it is welcome that all political parties are now committed to environmentalism at least in word, that is not enough.  Robust action is needed and, as we all know, the best environmental protection starts at home, in our local communities. 

‘Going green’ the republican way means ensuring that all of us are guaranteed, as a right, a safe and sustainable environment in which to live and work. We need to ensure that local authorities fulfil their obligations in areas for which they are directly responsible and also by making sure that local businesses and others comply fully with all the relevant regulations dealing with environmental protection and waste management. 

Our commitment to the devolution of as much power as possible to locally elected representatives and the community itself is especially important, as the Government has tended in recent years to remove powers in this area from local authorities and transfer them to unelected Managers or to a distant Minister. This has had serious implications for waste management policy in particular and has resulted in proposals to build unnecessary incinerators, overdependence on landfill, the imposition of double taxation service charges for waste collection and also in illegal dumping. 

We believe that councils need more powers to protect the local environment and that previous powers to control waste management decisions in particular must be restored. Sinn Féin will use all existing and campaign for additional powers to help councils uphold the environmental rights of all. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  Return power over waste management to local elected representatives through enactment of the Sinn Féin Waste Management (Amendment) Bill 2003.  
»  Progressive movement away from landfill and towards reduction, reuse and recycling, closure of all unsafe landfill sites and full remediation of contaminated dumpsites.  
»  Sufficient funding for recycling infrastructure. Separated waste collection for every home and business and widespread provision of public recycling amenities.  
»  An All-Ireland Landfill Levy to apply the polluter pays principle consistently nationwide and a levy requiring private operators to subsidise public recycling facilities, street cleaning and other civic amenities, as well as the combating of illegal dumping.  
»  Repeal of the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Use membership on the Environment Strategic/Municipal Policy Committees to work with local communities and other environmental advocacy partners. 
» Press all councils to use their Local and Regional Waste Management Plans to adopt a strategy of achieving Zero Waste through set targets for reduction, reuse and recycling, by making the necessary local facilities available and to further support this through minimum waste procurement decisions. 
» Oppose incineration or other thermal treatment and landfill for waste disposal and ensure each local electoral area has at least one civic amenity site for recycling. 
» Oppose the privatisation of waste management and the introduction of service charges for waste collection. 
» Support measures to eradicate illegal dumping, including increased enforcement and penalties. 
» Ensure that each council adopts a Local Climate Change Strategy. 
» Support the adoption of maximum energy conservation and renewable energy conversion measures. Advocate the use by local authorities of renewable energy sources, including biofuel, for authority-owned vehicles and facilities. 
» Encourage local energy generation from waste through Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants using biofuel produced by mechanical-biological treatment or anaerobic digestion, (as well as energy from other sustainable and renewable sources such as wind power). 
» Protect the public interest by supporting the adoption of local environmental protection measures, in particular those that protect sensitive wildlife habitats including wetlands and floodplains and those that ensure sustainable management of natural resources such as boglands. 
» Include the community and local businesses in the environmental protection process through regular consultation and provision of information. 
» Ensure their local authority has joined the Nuclear-Free Local Authority organisation and propose designation of their local authority area as free of Genetically Modified (GM) crops, to support Sinn Féin’s objectives of making Ireland both Nuclear-Free and GM crop-Free. 


Delivering Responsive Public Services 

Delivery of public services is the whole reason people willingly pay taxes. Ensuring that those public services match local need is the reason people democratically elect their representatives to government and by doing so entrust in them responsibility for management and oversight. In return for their hard-earned money and for their vote, people rightly expect that these services will not only be made available but will correspond to their actual needs and moreover uphold their and their children’s equal economic and social rights. 

While local government in this state at present exercises few or no powers in some areas of public services – such as healthcare, education, communications, energy supply and community safety – it exercises considerable control over delivery in others such as water and sewerage, transportation, fire services and recreational services and amenities. Where this is the case, it is imperative that local elected representatives ensure these powers are used responsibly in the public interest, to ensure the delivery of local services in a way that responds to local need and peoples’ rights. 

Sinn Féin will campaign for new local government powers to use public services to uphold the rights to healthcare, to education, to work, to an adequate standard of living, to safety and to ensure that the provision of these services meets the needs of our individual communities.8 

We will also use existing local government powers over public service delivery to uphold peoples’ equal rights: to clean water, to access by transportation, to safety, to leisure and play and to participate in cultural life. 

Water Services 
The importance of responsible water provision is brought into stark relief by the recent plight of the people of Galway and Clare, who have been periodically unable to use their domestic water supply for long periods due to contamination from sewage, lead and other bacterial sources. Sinn Féin has called for an independent enquiry into the causes of these water crises and outlined our proposals to prevent recurrence.  This should act as a wake-up call to councils across the state to take water supply protection seriously and to proactively prevent similar problems emerging elsewhere. 

All people have a fundamental and equal right to safe water and to its ‘free’ public supply, which is paid for by direct taxation. That entails ensuring that the water supply is protected from any threat of contamination and that the provision of water is retained in public hands to ensure both best management in the public interest and universal provision regardless of income. This is a core obligation of government at all levels.  It can literally be a matter of life and death.  Moreover businesses and the local economy suffer when an area develops a reputation for contaminated water 
– no one will want to invest or locate in such an area, with its risk of revenue loss or additional cost. 

Unnecessary water waste is of course another major environmental problem that is primarily caused by leakage as a consequence of inadequate water infrastructure. Imposing water charges or water metering to monitor household or commercial usage is not the answer. Investment in comprehensive infrastructural remediation is the only way to fully and finally solve the twin problems of both wastage and contamination. There is no way around this. 

Sinn Féin will use the full extent of our powers at local level to ensure responsible management of water services and we will also use our political strength to campaign for longer term solutions to uphold the right to water. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
» A comprehensive urgent review of need, driving planned investment in remediation of water infrastructure in all areas throughout the state.  The outcome must ensure that each and every urban and rural household has access to a reliably safe public supply of water, the quality of which complies with or exceeds the highest EU and EPA standards and delivery of which eliminates or minimises waste through leakage. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Use membership on the Water and Sewerage Strategic/ Municipal Policy Committees and otherwise to ensure that councils are diligent and proactive in water supply monitoring.  
»  Work to ensure a clean and safe public water supply to all local residents within the council area.  
»  Support the vigorous implementation of all EU and other regulations to ensure that the water supply is safe from contamination.  
»  Support enforcement of the principle that ‘the polluter pays’ against anyone responsible for contaminating or failing to protect the water supply.  
»  Call for the introduction of Source Protection Measures for all public and group water schemes.  
»  Ensure that councils engage in door-to-door public health notifications in contamination affected areas, arrange for free bottled or otherwise safe water to residents and lobby for state rebates for additional electricity use by those under boil water notices and for subsidised remediation measures where individual low and middle income private householders require pipe replacement, since people should not have to pay for failures of the state.  
»  Oppose any attempt to privatise the water supply and fight to keep water treatment plants in public ownership.  
»  Oppose charges for the use of water, including their imposition on schools and other non-commercial organisations under the EU Water Directive. Propose a waiver scheme in the interim.  
»  Support the implementation of effective strategies to conserve water and reduce waste and misuse pending structural remediation, such as education and information campaigns.  
»  Advocate grant support for public water conservation measures by farmers, including water self-sufficiency and water recycling for non-consumption purposes.  

Transportation Services 

Looking at the state of transportation in the 26 Counties, you would never know that the Celtic Tiger had come and gone. Both local and state-wide public transport is still characterised by a lack of availability, lack of accessibility and a lack of integration between services. Large portions of a formerly comprehensive rail network were closed down and much of the rolling stock is still from a bygone era. Many local and secondary road networks are crumbling and the countryside in particular is beset by accident blackspots that regularly claim lives. Most cities and towns also lack adequate provision for pedestrians making it dangerous to even cross the road, particularly for the elderly, people with disabilities and those with prams or small children. 

Since so many local developments were planned without consideration for access to public transport, people now have little choice but to use a car to participate in normal life. Our cities, towns and suburban beltways have consequently become car-congested and daily commuting a nightmare. Despite this and the environmental imperative to reduce private car dependency to stop climate change, the level of provision of environmentally sustainable public transport remains woeful. Indeed, the Irish Government’s grand Transport 21 plan offers nothing whatsoever to cyclists or pedestrians. 

We need to bring Irish transportation into the 21st century, with comprehensive local and national networks of sustainable public transport – biofuel or electric buses, commuter and freight trains, light and ultra lightrail trams in cities and major towns, a metro in the capital, cycle and pedestrian lanes, as well as special provision for both taxis and carpooling. We also need road networks that are sufficient to deal with volume, safely designed and well-maintained, with effective traffic management measures to maximise vehicular, cyclist and pedestrian safety. These are crucial not only to improve quality of life but also essential for economic prosperity. Yet local authority powers over transportation and public transportation in particular remain limited.
 
Taxi provision is one area where private transport meets public transport and over which local authorities have some control. Taxi services are especially important in those areas that still lack comprehensive public transport by bus, rail and tram. Sinn Féin opposed the deregulation of the taxi industry and warned of the ensuing hardship for taxi drivers and their families and we supported the introduction of the regulation of taxi licensing. We need more efficient and effective state and local regulation of the taxi industry in a manner that is compatible with the interests of taxi drivers and operators and of course that of the travelling public. 

Peoples’ rights to work, to education and to public services depend on their access – hence their right – to transportation and to public transport in particular.  Realising our collective right to a clean and safe environment also depends on this. We believe that councils should have more powers to provide and coordinate public transport and should incorporate transport needs into local and area planning involving all relevant stakeholders. Sinn Féin will use all existing and campaign for additional powers to help councils uphold the transportation rights of all. 
» Take action to secure the provision of more public buses 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following 

Fundamental Changes: 
»  Significantly greater public investment in public transportation to ensure more affordable and more frequent service and full public ownership of bus and rail services.  
»  The re-opening of the rail lines closed in the mid to late twentieth century and an extensive expansion of an all-Ireland rail network in the coming decades, including an extended Western Rail corridor serving Donegal and onwards to a Derry-Dublin rail link, as well as the restoration of the West Cork railway network.  
»  Increasing investment to upgrade all bus fleets, including the ancient fleet of school buses to ensure children can travel safely to and from school and to increase frequency of service on public routes.  
»  Improved public transport links to serve all major airports.  Public shuttle bus services to all secondary airports, with schedules that reflect actual flight times.  
»  Full ticketing and timetable integration between services, including the introduction of smartcards.  
»  All public transport made accessible to those with impaired mobility.  
»  Completion of the island-wide motorways, including and in particular the Atlantic Road Corridor from Waterford to Letterkenny as a seamless dual-carriageway built under public finance.  
»  Air services to link all airports islandwide, with schedules that reflect the needs of business commuters. Increased investment in local and regional airport development.  

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Use membership on the Transport Strategic/Municipal Policy Committees and otherwise to ensure that councils use zoning and planning decisions to ensure that public transport services all populated areas instead of forcing car dependence on residents and tourists. 
» Propose the transformation of local Council Road Departments into ‘Sustainable Transport Departments’ with a mandate to develop local sustainable transportation, ensuring full integration of local road and rail services. 
» Propose an audit of local unmet public transport need, focusing in particular on new developments and rural areas, taking into account changing demographics and increased demand. 
» Propose to increase the quantity and standard of park-and­ride facilities and Quality Bus Corridors (QBCs) to make it more attractive to travel by bus, train or tram than by car. Ensure public shuttle or other bus services are available from all feeder towns to local train stations. in rural areas, support community-based rural transport initiatives, including demand-responsive dial-up transit and ensure that all local transport operates to county boundaries and covers entire county.  
»  Ensure sufficient provision of bus and tram shelters that effectively protect all public transport users, including schoolchildren, from the elements.  
»  Oppose road tolling as a form of double taxation.  
»  Initiate local road network accident black spot audits, with the participation of the local communities affected and ensure that councils take appropriate traffic management and road maintenance measures to effectively address findings.  
»  Initiate pedestrian and cyclist safety audits of all cities, towns and villages and ensure expenditure concentrated on increasing cycle lanes and provision for pedestrians, including support for pedestrianised areas of city, town and village centres where appropriate.  
»  Ensure the provision of sufficient taxi ranks to meet local need.  
»  Ensure provision of recharging points for electric vehicles.  
»  Work with the local representatives of transport workers to oppose service cuts and ensure fair pay and conditions.  

Fire and Ambulance Services 
Effective local emergency services are an essential component of community safety. Fire brigades respond to fires, road traffic accidents, ambulance calls, flooding, spills or leaks of hazardous substances. Ambulance teams regularly save lives. Society owes its respect and gratitude to firefighting and paramedical staff and their representatives, for their public service and the risks they willingly take on our behalf. 

Communities have the right to expect effective protection from these services and local authorities have the responsibility to ensure that these services are well structured, well-run and receive adequate support. Yet too often local emergency services are starved of resources, equipment and personnel, are overstretched and firefighters in particular work without the benefit of updated fire risk assessments. This puts lives in unnecessary danger. 

Community safety is a key priority for Sinn Féin and we will work with local emergency service providers and their representatives to ensure that all local powers are exercised fully to give them the support they need to do their jobs and make all our lives safer. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
» A single Strategic Fire Services Executive to coordinate, administer and regulate the fire service state-wide and later island-wide, in line with international best practice. 

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Consult regularly with the representatives of local emergency service workers. 
» Propose inclusion of a Fire Brigade representative on the Planning Strategic/Municipal Policy Committee and other planning fora and ensure that planning decisions take into account emergency access and the need for sustainable traffic diversions. 
» Propose establishment of Fire Service Advisory Boards at local level including residents and local elected representatives to enhance communication and strategic planning with the local fire authority. 
» Propose regular regional fire risk assessments involving the local Fire Brigade/s, firefighters’ representatives, local elected representatives, the HSE and other stakeholders. » Propose local equipment audits against need for both fire and ambulance services. 
» Support a single ambulance command and control system for Fire Brigade and HSE ambulance deployment. 
» Support full North-South cooperation in emergency service provision in border areas. 

Recreational Services and Amenities 
Over the last decade thousands of housing estates were built with no community centres, youth clubs, arts or sports facilities provided. Many established communities, particularly villages or economically marginal urban areas, face the same problem. The chronic lack of facilities for young people in particular, a legacy of bad planning, has been cited as a contributory factor to depression, drug and alcohol use and anti-social behaviour amongst teenagers. While recent improvements have been made in the provision of playgrounds for children, there is still much that needs to be done.  Too many communities continue to lack library access, or permanent space for artists and audiences, or for community cultural events.  Many potential historical and recreational amenities that could both serve local populations and attract tourists remain underdeveloped for lack of funding or vision. 

Involvement in sports, arts and other recreational activities provides many benefits for both the individual and the community as a whole. It can enhance personal development and reduce anti-social activity among young people and provide a social outlet for adults and older people who might otherwise be prone to isolation. It can have important benefits for physical and mental health in all ages and contribute to increasing life chances. As such, investment in cultural infrastructure reaps broad and long term social benefits by, for example, reducing pressure on the health system from lifestyle induced illnesses such as obesity and alcoholism and reducing demand on Gardaí for policing anti-social behaviour. So even in recessionary times, such spending makes economic sense. 

Local councils have considerable powers over provision of libraries, parks and open spaces, swimming pools, recreation centres, the arts, culture, museums, galleries and other amenities. But their ability to deliver is largely dependent on available resources and political will. 

Local authorities can and must play a leading role in ensuring equitable access to public cultural and recreational facilities and amenities. Everyone, regardless of economic, social or cultural background should be included and welcome. 
Sinn Féin will advocate the full exercise of all local powers and use our collective strength to lobby for additional resources to ensure that each community has and that all within our communities have, equal access to basic public arts, sports, cultural and recreational services and amenities as of right. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  A commitment from central government to put in place the public funding needed to redress the shortcomings identified in the audit of community, sports and arts facilities.  
»  Provision of a funding package for local authorities to deliver community-based music and arts education projects in disadvantaged communities.  
»  More local arts capital funding to support development of local arts infrastructure and for removal of the restrictions on subventions for temporary arts spaces.  
»  Devolution of powers in respect of sports capital grants to local authorities in order to reduce bureaucracy and delays and allow better response to local needs.  

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Engage directly with all arts, sports, cultural and community groups to determine local needs and promote local leadership and participation in arts and sports and use membership on the Recreation and Amenities Strategic/ Municipal Policy Committees and otherwise to ensure that councils do the same. 
» Ensure that better use is made of existing civic buildings (including town halls and libraries) to deliver access to the arts (including music education and drama), while also ensuring that all such facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. 
» Ensure that all local authority leases to sports clubs are for multiple use to maximise available amenities. 
» Ensure that all development plans for towns with a population of 1,000 or more include the provision of one-stop recreational centres (including facilities such as a cinema, bowling alley, swimming pool and youth café). 
» Ensure fair and transparent allocation of local arts funding under the Percentage for Arts Scheme, including local democratic input and a focus on support for local artists and community arts projects in disadvantaged areas. 
» Establish clear and fair criteria for public art contracts and ensure local community/artists input into the selection process. 
» Ensure that all councils focus on the provision of age appropriate sports and recreational facilities: 
» For children: a centrally located play ground in each population centre (village, pre-village/low order settlement and urban development). 
» For young people and adults: sports and recreation facilities including skate parks and tennis/basketball courts, to be provided in existing open spaces under local authority ownership. 
» For older people: outdoor gyms such as that recently developed in Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath (facilities similar to what exists in other countries including various equipment designed to improve joint mobility, muscle strength and increase overall activity levels). 
» Ensure adequate resources for the upkeep of parks and open spaces, including the provision of wardens to ensure maintenance and the safety of those using the amenity. 
» Ensure that people on low incomes, particularly young people from low income families, are not excluded from participation in arts, sports and recreation due to cost considerations. 
» Ensure councils use local arts and sports funding to promote interculturalism, Irish language, arts and other activities and inclusion of women and people with disabilities. 

Growing and Spreading Local Prosperity 
Imagine a national network of vibrant and prosperous local economies supporting our communities. And imagine that within these economies there are enough good quality jobs with fair pay and conditions for all. That all can access the kind and level of education required to reach their full potential. That all the necessary infrastructure is publicly provided – including childcare for workers, transportation, communications and renewable energy – so that businesses want to invest and locate and remain. That innovation in business and diversification of entrepreneurship is supported and fostered.  That enterprises need not turn over massive or even any profits to be valued for their social benefit to the community and economy, whether that is in employment or services provided.  Prosperity with equality. With no one and no community left behind. That is the Sinn Féin economic vision and we will not be deterred. 
While local government in this state at present exercises few or no real powers related to supporting local economies – such as over economic development, or provision of education, childcare, or communications infrastructure and energy supply – local elected representatives are often appointed to other bodies of relevance: Development Boards, LEADER and Partnership Boards, Vocational Education Committees, Ports and Airport Authorities and Harbour Boards and more. 
Sinn Féin will campaign for new local government powers to manage the local economy and to uphold related rights to education, to work and to an adequate standard of living. And we will use any and all positions and influence available to our councillors to help grow and spread local prosperity in a way that responds to local need and peoples’ rights. 

Economic Development 
Approximately four out of five industrial enterprises in this state are small firms employing less than 50 people. Moreover, 95% of small industrial firms are Irish-owned and likely to stay put if they can survive, while almost half of all larger firms are foreign-owned and therefore just as likely to relocate due to factors beyond Irish control. Despite providing the bulk of Irish employment, small to medium firms receive the least state investment. This is both unfair and economically unwise. Councils could play a much bigger role in providing help and support for this kind of enterprise and thereby help keep both business and jobs local. 

The ‘National Development Plan’, with all its important commitments to build infrastructure essential for prosperity, must be implemented in full if local economies are to grow, attract and retain businesses and further investment. Yet local authorities have no real control over its content or progress. 
For all its granting support that has benefited local communities, the EU also imposes significant constraints on the ability to grow local economies and create conditions that foster local prosperity. For example, EU state aid rules restrict government’s ability to inject assistance.  EU Directives aimed at privatising public services are pressuring councils to let private operators run essential local authority services that benefit businesses as well, such as waste collection and water provision. A number of councils have fought back against this trend and continue to provide excellent services themselves. But where they have failed to do so and services have been privatised, businesses and domestic users face higher charges, arbitrary price increases and service cutbacks.  This does not help. 
Precisely because central government refuses to provide adequate funding to local authorities based on need, councils have become reliant on alternative income from local businesses including commercial rates, development levies and other charges. We agree that businesses should pay their fair share back into local communities but the wide variance in rates and charges from one council to the next is aggravating unequal development. Companies naturally search for the ‘cheaper’ local authority areas – that is, those that can charge less because they are already more economically robust and better serviced. Weaker local economies are thereby locked into a low-income, low-service/infrastructure, low-growth cycle from which they cannot escape. 
Quite simply, local authorities are hamstrung by their lack of powers to support local economies and local businesses. Local councils should act as an effective lobby on central government to provide needed supports and cooperate with local businesses and workers to create conditions that attract inward investment without compromising the rights of people to public services, or to decent pay and conditions. 

Sinn Féin is committed to keeping business local.  Uneven and under-development is a remnant from the previous century and must end. All communities have the right to access that which makes an area economically competitive: a well-educated workforce, good childcare and healthcare, good infrastructure, fair rates.  We will use what powers are available to us – on councils, on Development Boards, LEADER and Partnership Boards and on Ports and Airport Authorities and otherwise – to support in particular the small and medium enterprises less likely to relocate and social enterprises especially.  We believe that local business deserves fair support, backed by fair contributions to the local community from them, to achieve the common objective of sustainable local economic growth for the benefit of all. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  The same quantity and quality of grants and other supports to be made available to indigenous enterprise as to inward investors.  
»  A mandatory penalty clause in the event of closure or relocation, applied to all new agreements with companies receiving government grants.  Where legally allowable under current contracts for one or both parties to alter terms, insertion of a new penalty clause. Otherwise, a policy of denying future contracts on this basis to such companies and their parents or subsidiaries.  
»  An end to EU restrictions on state aid, particularly where such aid assists local economic development and regeneration.  
»  Establishment of a bi-annual state-wide forum involving all public stakeholders in economic development, ensuring collective accountability, better coordination and elimination of duplication.  
»  Social and economic data collected and published county by county to inform and enable tailored needs-based plans for job creation, infrastructure and public service delivery.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Engage directly with local businesses, trade unions, farmers, fishing communities and other social partners and use membership on City and County Development Boards and Enterprise Boards, LEADER and Partnership Boards and otherwise to ensure that councils do the same. 
» Propose a review of the functioning and management of City and County Development Boards and City and County Enterprise Boards with the objective of making them more responsive to the needs of local communities and businesses. 
» Propose that City and County Enterprise Boards and Development Boards conduct a thorough review of the barriers to local small, medium and social enterprises availing of grant aid.  Support schemes should be revised to increase employment grants, stock grants, cashflow support grants, internal efficiency supports, knowledge developments supports and remove the matching funds requirement. 
» Demand and monitor government delivery on all local transport, broadband, energy and educational commitments made in the National Development Plan.9 
» Propose the setting up of one-stop shops to provide business support for small to medium and social enterprise. These centres can be based out of local authority offices and should involve all the main business bodies: Chambers of Commerce, Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Agency (IDA). 
» Propose to make unused IDA lands available for purchase by local authorities at less than current market value (in many cases these lands were sold to IDA by local authorities and state infrastructure has made them more valuable) and for local authorities to use these landbanks to provide low-cost serviced sites for local business start-up incubation units. 
» Lobby Enterprise Ireland to support joint SME export ventures involving the development and marketing of local, regional and All-Ireland brands (ie., the West Cork Fuschia brand and the Homethrown Pottery network). 
» Ensure full application of Retail Planning Guidelines and propose development of a strategy to support retention of local retailers in local communities, including the enhancement of local retail infrastructure, to prevent the drainage of local small and medium retail business to big superstores in city and town centres, or in retail parks on their periphery. 
» Where there is identified need, make planning approval for new retail developments conditional on provision of facilities for farmers’ markets and expand provision for casual traders. 
» Support fair rates and development contributions that help local authorities provide needed services to all, but do not penalise local businesses for a lack of central government funding. 
» Advocate funding for the establishment of community-based co-operative or other social enterprises. » Lobby for reduction of the qualification for the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to 12 months for all applicants. 
» Lobby for a sustained supply of Community Employment (CE) and Job Initiative (JI) places and to protect these jobs against cuts imposed in the current recession. 
»  Oppose privatisation of local authority services, which ends up costing service users more. Where such is already underway, ensure full cost/benefit analyses of public versus private contracts and propose the review of existing contracts to establish if they are providing value for money for business and domestic users.  
»  Ensure enforcement of contracts awarded to private regeneration companies so that pull-outs meet severe penalties.  
»  Ensure that all council decisions protect workers’ rights including workplace safety and the right to collective bargaining and that councils themselves do not employ agency workers or hire contractors who do not provide the highest standard of workers’ rights for their staff.  


Education 
Education is an essential tool for building an Ireland of Equals.  It is also the engine for the prosperous economy needed to deliver this. Government has an obligation to enable learners of all ages and life stages to achieve their full potential through access to the levels of curriculum, institutions and type of teaching and learning best suited to support their personal success and hence ability to contribute to the economy. Looking at our schools, however, no one would know this is one of the world’s wealthiest states. Decades of underinvestment in the education system have produced an appalling vista. 
Our primary schools are in serious debt due to insufficient funds. Many schools find that central government funding Capitation Grants cover only half their daily running costs. Indeed, 8 out of 10 schools must now fundraise privately to meet their basic needs. Were it not for the commitment of Boards, principals, teachers, parents’ associations and local communities many schools would have to close their doors. It will be much more difficult for schools to raise this revenue in the current economic climate. 

Approximately €40m per year is wasted on renting run-down, damp and even rat-infested prefabs.  These are funds that could otherwise be available to invest in improving schools’ permanent accomodation. Perhaps to hide the truth, the Minister discontinued the School Buildings List which included priority ratings and indicative dates of construction for the one in three schools that have applied for help. More than a thousand school communities now have no idea when or even if their school will receive much needed repairs or extensions. 
We have the most overcrowded classrooms in the EU. The quality of education depends on configuring provision to ensure class sizes small enough to enable all to learn effectively. Yet persistently and increasingly large class sizes stack the deck against most children. There is no viable option but to invest to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. 
Too few special needs teachers mean children left behind and denied life chances. The only way children with special needs will ever achieve their full potential in education is through early intervention and the sufficient provision of trained special needs teachers. Yet children have to wait approximately two years to access speech and language therapy or assessment by educational psychologists. Almost nowhere is the provision of special needs teachers sufficient to meet demand. 

After more than a decade of the Celtic Tiger, functional illiteracy remains widespread, affecting almost one in four of the adult population. Having an adaptable workforce equipped with the right skills is critical to economic performance. Yet, almost one in three adults has only junior certificate or less. One in ten workers has only primary level, or no formal qualifications at all. This is not acceptable. Where low levels of educational attainment are geographically concentrated, the results for local economies are obvious.  Poverty becomes cyclical and generationally locked-in. 
There is still huge inequality in access to and participation in third level education for economically disadvantaged young people. A truly prosperous society demands that third level education should no longer be the exclusive preserve of the wealthy, but accessible to all equally based on ability alone. Despite increased participation in third level education by students from disadvantaged areas, only one in five children of unskilled and semi-skilled workers attend university or college, while almost all children from affluent areas do so. The fundamentally flawed grants system does little to aid low income students. It comes in too late and does not cover the real costs of pursuing higher education – much less the major economic barriers for mature students, lower income groups and single parents: accommodation and childcare. Economically marginal students get into debt, work too many hours and under-perform at exams, or drop out. Hence the system effectively confers continued advantage on those who already have adequate means, confining others to either student poverty or exclusion from studies. Reintroduction of fees requiring student loans will only make this situation worse. 
People pay taxes on the reasonable expectation that educational provision will be covered and universally provided to the highest possible standard. But the reality is that local educational needs are simply not met by central government. Contentment to remain near the bottom of the league of EU states on educational spend will come back to haunt Government, hampering its ability to engineer an economic recovery in these tougher times. 

A significant increase in local powers and local control over education as well as funding and fundamental structural reform, are clearly warranted as a matter of urgency for our communities and their economies.  Sinn Féin will campaign for this and in the meantime, where we have positions on VECs we will use their limited existing powers to the maximum in this regard. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  An end to education budget cuts and a significant increase in public investment in education to at least the OECD average (6% of GDP), to eliminate the need for private fundraising.  
»  No Public-Private Partnerships in public education, which have proved detrimental or disastrous in other jurisdictions.  
»  A 50% increase in the School Capitation Grant.  
»  Eradication of prefabs and reinstatement of the School Buildings List.  
»  Reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio to 20:1 or less, as is international best practice.  
»  Full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN).  
»  An end to chronic underfunding of the National Education Psychological Services (NEPS) and the situation whereby huge sections of the country, especially rural areas, have no access to this service at all.  
»  Reversal of cuts to provision of learning support.  
»  No reintroduction of third level fees. Part-time fees eliminated, the number of third level places reserved for mature students increased, social welfare recipients  
permitted to retain their benefits while in full-time study and the eligibility criteria for the Back to Work Allowance expanded – all of which will help enable low income and unemployed persons and single parents to return to education.  
»  Realistic funding for basic essential student college expenses such as accommodation, childcare, travel, text books, etc.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Engage with local teachers’ unions, parents’ organisations, student groups and education providers to identify priorities and lobby the Minister for Education to ensure the educational needs of all in the community are met. 
» Campaign against education cuts and for significant increases in investment in education, with a focus on ensuring sufficient provision for local disadvantaged students. 
» Campaign for a reduction in class sizes and for greater provision of special needs teachers and other essential resources.

»  Use positions on VECs to ensure focus on tackling local educational disadvantage, including provision of breakfast and homework clubs.  
»  Use positions on VECs to ensure an adequate network of local community training centres, literacy services and back to education programmes that correspond fully to the diversity of local need – including increased need as a result of recession-driven unemployment.  
»  Propose that all available public classroom space is optimally utilised at all times, ie. for out-of-hours training for workers.  


Childcare 
In 21st century Ireland, childcare is essential for equality and for prosperity. It is crucial to improve early childhood education, increase family incomes and lift families out of poverty by allowing parents back to work or education and underpin women’s equal right to work and to equal pay. State-led provision of childcare can make our economy more competitive by reducing childcare provision burdens on individual businesses and working parents. Moreover, childcare is a wise public investment that could earn between €4 and €7 for every euro spent. However, UNICEF has found that this state is bottom of the league table of 25 OECD countries in its provision of early childhood education and care. 
Quite simply, Irish childcare is in crisis. It is notoriously expensive and simply out of reach for many low income families. Childcare costs are so high that it has become known as ‘the second mortgage’. Such community-based childcare as exists is now under threat by the central government’s new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme.  This ill-conceived tiered income-related scheme is creating divisions between children from families who receive social welfare payments and those who earn low wages. It is not the right way to fund childcare and as a result many crèches serving the community’s most vulnerable families have had their funding cut and still others are being forced to close down. Many low income parents now face fees that have increased or even doubled. Central government has also completely failed to address the disgracefully low pay of childcare workers in the community sector. 

While local government does not have direct powers or control over childcare provision at present, councillors can ensure that developers provide childcare facilities as part of their planning permission. All local communities and economies have a vested interest in making sure that childcare is available to all who need it. Sinn Féin councillors will stand with parents and providers in making this demand and will use their influence to ensure that local childcare needs are fully met. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  State-led provision of comprehensive childcare made  available to all who need it equally as of right and funded by  general direct and progressive taxation.  
»  Introduction of universal early childhood education and  care including universal pre-school for 3 to 5s and an  afterschool childcare system.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Engage with City and County Childcare Committees through Council Working Groups on Childcare in order to ensure the local authority does everything within its power to meet the childcare needs of the community. 
» Stand with parents and childcare workers to demand the scrapping of the fundamentally flawed Community Childcare Subvention Scheme and fight to keep local community crèches open. 
» Support provision or restoration of core funding to all local community-based crèches, to ensure equal access for all who need it to good quality childcare. 
» Require developers to construct childcare facilities in all new housing developments and transfer these to the ownership of the local authority upon completion. 
» Propose that all councils adopt a Local Authority Childcare Policy. 
» Lobby the Minister to remove all childcare-related barriers to parents accessing VTOS and Back to Education Schemes, such as non-funding of childcare during holiday periods. 


Communications Infrastructure 
Broadband has become widely recognised as an essential tool for economic development in the 21st century.  Communities, businesses and individuals without access to communications technology including broadband will simply get left behind. Yet after all the years of increasing wealth that was available for investment, this state still lacks 100% broadband connectivity. Many communities, businesses and individuals continue to do without. Indeed, Ireland is now the only EU country where more people still use narrow band or dial-up. 
The state not only lags far behind the EU average in broadband rollout, it also has some of the highest costs and lowest speeds in the EU. This effectively penalises businesses who locate and remain here.  It has to end. 
The so-called ‘Digital Divide’ is real: and it runs along the standard axis of unequal regional development. The one in three uptake in Dublin may not be impressive, but it far outstrips the Border region at just over one in ten. The ‘National Broadband Strategy’ has glossed over this reality by listing areas as ‘connected’ that in reality are not.  Broadband black spots continue to blight ostensibly connected counties and councils have played a crucial role in identifying this deficit. 
Despite growth there are still problems with broadband access particularly in rural parts of Ireland. It is common for people in rural communities to struggle to send emails or even access the internet because they cannot get the service.  Rollout of broadband in rural towns, villages and outlying areas is of vital importance to the future economic development of rural Ireland. 
For the same economic reasons, every school without exception should be able to teach their curriculum through information and communications technologies and every school must be fully ICT enabled. This means providing and updating teacher training, equipment, teaching materials, PCs and laptops. 
While broadband access is available to the majority of schools, most find their computers and technology are too old to operate it. Broadband needs modern computers and networks to operate effectively. It is simply a waste of taxpayer’s money to introduce broadband into schools that cannot afford to replace or upgrade hardware. More than 8 in 10 of our schools need a significant proportion of their computer equipment repaired or updated. 
Local authorities exercise no powers in relation to broadband provision, but that does not stop local councils and councillors from acting as advocates for broadband provision to all in their communities. 

Sinn Féin understands that an all-Ireland broadband infrastructure is a vital element for future prosperity. We support a state-owned telecommunications grid and would prioritise investment in rolling out broadband networks across the island. We support universal and therefore equal access to broadband – for every business, library, school and home. Our councillors will use all their influence to achieve this. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  An all-Ireland approach to ensure accelerated broadband  roll-out so that everyone on the island without exception  has affordable and efficient access to broadband.  
»  A timetabled plan to ensure broadband coverage of and  provision to all communities by 2010.  
»  Better regulation to ensure lower prices and higher speeds.  
»  An end to EU restrictions that prevent local authorities from  facilitating and developing free access to broadband.  
»  Broadband services and technology labs for every primary  and secondary school and ICT hubs for each classroom,  with adequate teaching and curriculum support available to  maximise the use of these resources.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Continue to monitor broadband availability in their local areas and push for 100% connectivity. 
» Insist on inspections led by the Department of Communications to verify private provider claims of connectivity where the local authority has identified persistent broadband blackspots. 
» Propose mandatory telecommunications ducting as a condition of planning permission for all new significant residential, commercial and public building developments. 
» Ensure minimum bandwidth of 7MB/s for all towns with populations of over 5,000 by 2011. 
» Propose a local public awareness campaign to promote and maximise broadband uptake by residential and business users. 
» Lobby for central government support to pilot next generation broadband schemes where existing broadband infrastructure supports this. 


Energy Infrastructure 
Energy infrastructure and provision plays a crucial role in our communities and their economies. Its availability and price are important considerations for businesses and can make a difference in attracting and retaining investment. The availability of renewable energy in particular is more important than ever before. Not only will it help protect our environment and therefore our communities and economies from the effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel-based energy, but it is generally cheaper.  Consequently increasing demand can expect to grow this sector, meaning local renewable energy infrastructure and generation has the potential to help stabilise and regenerate local economies. 
Ireland remains stuck below the EU average in renewable energy generation, but with its abundant access to wind and wave power in particular, it has the potential to lead. Moreover, the island is still dangerously dependent on foreign fossil fuels. This leaves us vulnerable to external forces and means we have little domestic control over pricing. The agricultural sector deserves support for conversion to biofuel crops where this is viable – and to a viable extent – as well as the production of other biomass fuels either through pelletisation or mechanical-biological treatment and the reclaiming of energy produced through combined heat and power technology.  Wind farms could provide important sources of cheap electricity and local income for rural, coastal and mountain communities.  Wave energy technology remains in its infancy, but is being pioneered on Ireland’s west coast. It is not hard to imagine the difference a renewable energy economy could make to hard-hit farming, coastal and other rural communities. 
Renewable energy holds huge potential for future job creation. It can reduce energy costs for business and domestic consumers. Where generation comes from publicly-owned local projects, it represents a potential source of local public revenue. Of course, it can make a significant contribution to the fight against climate change. 
Sinn Féin supports the development of a publicly-owned all-Ireland energy grid, converted as quickly as feasible to a range of renewable sources with a view to establishing energy independence and even export over time. There should be state-led investment in developing the renewable energy sector on an accelerated basis. We also support decentralised energy production. Communities should be encouraged to become self-sufficient in renewable energy production wherever possible. This will require a combination of increased energy efficiency in buildings and products, consumer use reduction and support for the development of local sources and distribution. 
Local government has no formal powers over energy production, distribution and regulation, but it still has a role to play. It can investigate the potential for and invest in local provision by purchasing or providing public lands. It can set local energy efficiency requirements on planning applications, set local targets for conversion and provide preferential planning approvals for renewable energy projects where there is compliance with all 

other standards. Sinn Féin will use positions on local councils and » Work with all relevant stakeholders to establish a local 
all existing powers to realise our vision of a renewable energy economy supporting our local communities. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  A reorientation of state policy and a timetabled strategy to  plan for total conversion to renewable energy and establish  energy independence.  
»  Significant public investment in state-led development  of the renewable energy sector, including support for  establishment of a publicly-owned all-Ireland grid,  decentralisation of production, community ownership,  agricultural conversion and conversion of other local rural  and coastal economies.  
»  A state education and training policy, research and  development funding and planning appropriate to support  rapid sectoral growth in renewable energy.  

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Ensure each council investigates the potential for local conversion to, generation of and public investment in renewable energy. 
» Ensure each council adopts a Local Renewable Energy Strategy for incorporation into the local Development Plan and regularly monitors and reviews its implementation 
» Ensure each council maximises use of indigenous renewable energy such as wind, biomass and biofuel, particularly for its own buildings and vehicles. 
» Propose preferential planning approval for energy efficient developments and conversions and for renewable energy projects where all other standards are also met. 
» Support energy efficiency requirements for planning permission in new builds. 
» Propose and seek granting support for conversion and retrofitting of all local authority-owned buildings, which could create significant new employment for building workers and others made redundant by the recession. Ensure the awarding of such public contracts to local small, medium or social enterprises where possible. 
» Propose and seek funding for subsidised conversion and retrofitting for low income home-owners. 
» Ensure the council sources funding for and pursues priority investment in local renewable energy projects. 
» Work with the local VEC to make free retraining opportunities available to unemployed tradespeople to qualify them as energy rating assessors, or in the installation of solar, wood-pellet, ground-heating and mini-wind turbine systems, as well as energy-saving and insulation systems.

Raising the Quality of Life 
All public services, delivered well and delivered equally to all, can play a crucial role in raising the quality of life for whole communities, as well as the families and individuals within them. Where local authorities have powers in relation to these services, they must use them to meet communities’ real needs.  But even in those areas of public services over which local authorities have little power at present, this does not stop local elected representatives from using their influence to maximum effect to help improve delivery of essential services and thereby raise the quality of everyday life for all residents. 
Despite a lack of local powers in the crucial areas of policing for community safety, healthcare delivery and provision of postal services, Sinn Féin elected representatives can be counted on to take every opportunity to campaign for fundamental reform, for local accountability, for retention of local access on an equal basis and for the peoples’ rights that these services should uphold. 
We are committed to doing whatever it takes to end the inequality in healthcare, policing and postal service provision within and between local areas and to ensure that these services are used to strengthen the fabric of our communities. 
Moreover, we are committed to empowering local residents so that their own voices on these matters are heard by decision-makers. 
Community Safety 
People have the right to feel safe in their homes and communities. But between inundation with media reports and actual statistical increases in certain kinds of crimes, people genuinely feel less safe than they used to. Individuals and communities experience real insecurity due to violence – whether that is linked to the illegal drugs trade, domestic or sexual violence, alcohol-fuelled assaults and public disorder – or ‘anti-social behaviour’ which, although it may not be criminal, still has the power to instill fear. All of these sources of community and individual insecurity warrant effective and appropriate action. 
Unfortunately Garda deployment does not always correspond to the actual safety and security needs of local communities and local Gardaí are not accountable to the communities they serve. The rate at which criminal proceedings are brought and successfully completed remains very low. And indeed the Gardaí and the criminal court system cannot create safer communities on their own. Local authorities and communities themselves have a hugely important role to play in cooperation with and in addition to the Gardaí, in preventing criminal, anti-social and nuisance behaviour and in ensuring that local policing responds to actual community need. 
With the right policies, prevention is possible. For example, most children at risk of involvement in crime and other anti­social behaviour are easily identifiable. A recent study by the Association for Criminal Research and Development found that children living in deprived urban settings are at significantly greater risk of becoming involved in crime and children from certain geographical locations are thirty times more likely to end up before the Children’s Court. In the interests of long-term crime reduction and safer communities, local authorities must ensure that resources and family support services focus on these areas. Indeed, planning decisions – entirely within the powers of local authorities – can also have an important impact on children’s and therefore whole communities’ chances. (See the section on Planning for more detail.) 

What is Community Restorative Justice?  Real Justice for Victims, Real Justice for Communities 
Community Restorative Justice (CRJ) contrasts with the ‘punitive’ prosecutorial justice system in that it involves victims and communities directly and ensures that the offender actually confronts their behaviour and its causes and takes steps to make up for the harm they have done. This ‘restorative’ dimension leads to much higher levels of victim satisfaction with the process. 
CRJ is not an alternative to, but has the potential to complement, the prosecutorial justice system.  CRJ is not appropriate for some crimes, particularly domestic violence, child abuse or sexual assault, but may be used effectively in response to lower level criminal behaviour. 
Community Mediation Schemes (CMS) may also be employed to respond to non criminal nuisance type behaviour and neighbour disputes.  CMS can help avoid the delays and high costs that are inherent to the civil court system. 
Local authorities have no power over local policing.  However local councillors are represented on Joint Policing Committees (JPCs), a mechanism to provide for increased Garda accountability at a local level, recently introduced on foot of Sinn Féin demands. Though the JPCs lack the full extent of powers originally proposed by Sinn Féin, they nonetheless offer a new avenue for communities to influence policing in their area. 
Sinn Féin representatives will work to maximise the potential of JPCs and to ensure that each one provides a real opportunity for the community to directly determine their local policing priorities including through the holding of public meetings and the establishment of fully inclusive neighbourhood policing fora at a more local level. 


Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Change: 
»  More resources for crime prevention, in particular  investment in communities’ social infrastructure, parenting  support and programmes for children and young people at  risk including juvenile diversion.  
»  Strengthened civilian oversight to make local policing  accountable to the communities served, including more  powers to Joint Policing Committees, their establishment  at District level and sufficient resources for the Garda  Ombudsman Commission and Human Rights Commission  to operate effectively.  
»  More resources for community policing and civilianisation  of Garda administrative services to make more Gardaí  available on the beat.  
»  More resources for rehabilitative services during custody  and post-release, including probation services, to prevent  reoffending and to allow alternatives to custody for non­ violent offences, including restoration.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Fight to establish Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) in all Councils. 
» Use their membership of JPCs to influence local policing, with a view to increasing and ring-fencing the number of community Gardaí and juvenile liaison officers and to changing rostering and deployment arrangements so that Gardaí are on patrol in the locations and during the hours that they are most needed. 
» Work to ensure that JPCs are sufficiently funded and that all related monies available to local authorities are drawn down in full. 
» Use planning and recreation decisions to directly contribute to enhanced community safety.
»  Continue to promote the expansion of local community  restorative justice options and greater availability  of community mediation services in the interests of  community safety and greater quality of life.  
»  Ensure all councils work with the Gardaí and local women’s  support services to conduct Women’s Safety Audits of all  city districts, towns and villages.  
»  Campaign for a coherent strategy to maximise Garda  visibility in rural areas.  
»  Demand that all drug-related monies seized by Gardaí  or by CAB are channelled into community development  initiatives in the area from which they were seized, or  whatever local area ismost affected by the trade.  
»  Work to ensure that local councils, in particular Local  Authority Housing Units and Anti-Social Behaviour Units,  work together with the Gardaí, the HSE, education providers  and the community and voluntary sector to introduce real  and lasting solutions to crime and anti-social behaviour  with an emphasis on prevention and early intervention.  
»  Campaign for a standardised council approach to anti­ social behaviour and a positive council policy of immediate  action against anti-social behaviour in parks and other  public spaces including a commitment that all graffiti  and other damage to play-grounds, vacant buildings etc.  be responded to and remediated without delay by the  responsible division (eg. Parks, Environment or Housing).  
»  Promote the introduction of Good Community Agreements  inclusive of all residents and other stakeholders, 12 month  Local Authority Introductory Tenancy Agreements subject  to appeal and robust eviction guidelines to ensure that  where eviction is manifestly necessary in the interests of  justice, proper procedures that comply with the European  Convention on Human Rights are followed by the Council,  thereby reducing the vulnerability of evictions to legal  challenge.


Healthcare 
Healthcare is one of the biggest issues of concern in our local communities. It is also the biggest single area of central government spending. 
There is general agreement that most healthcare services can and should be delivered as near to where the patient lives as possible. The vast majority of healthcare is provided in local areas at primary level by general practitioners, pharmacists and other community-based services. Yet current central government health policy appears to ignore local needs. 
11  In May 2008 the High Court ruled that the law governing the current local authority evic­tions procedure is incompatible with the ECHR on the basis that it denies the evictee certain due process rights. 
The GP to patient ratio remains at just over half the EU average and lower in disadvantaged communities, yet the Government has provided less than 100 of the 600 primary care centres promised. Cuts in HSE spending, including the recruitment ban, have hit local frontline services hard and moreover prevented essential and long overdue developments and improvements. The policy of over-centralising hospital services has slashed services in local hospitals throughout the state. Government privatisation of our health services has created a grossly inequitable health system which provides services on the basis of ability to pay or geography and not medical need alone. To compound the injustice we pay double and triple taxation for healthcare through private insurance and user fees. 
Fundamental change is warranted and it must be based on the principles of excellence in care, equality of access for all based on need alone and full democratic accountability for the delivery of services. 
Ninety years ago the First Dáil Éireann declared in its Democratic Programme that ‘it shall be the duty of the Republic to take such measures as will safeguard the health of the people and ensure the physical as well as the moral well-being of the Nation.’ In addition it declared that our aged and infirm ‘shall not be regarded as a burden but rather entitled to the Nation’s gratitude and consideration.’ 
We have yet to establish a healthcare system which applies those principles of equality and which safeguards the health of all the people, especially the most vulnerable. While standards of care have been transformed and life expectancy for the majority of people has improved, there are still major gaps, glaring inequality and widespread inefficiencies. For this reason Sinn Féin is campaigning for a new universal public health system for Ireland that provides care to all free at the point of delivery on the basis of need alone.12 
Local planning and local democratic accountability are sorely needed. Local government should play a key role in managing healthcare delivery because the people have the right to a say, through their public representatives, in how best to deliver healthcare to them. Yet at present our communities have no part in planning how healthcare should be delivered and neither they nor their elected representatives can hold the Health Service Executive to account. The role of elected councils is confined to nominating members to powerless HSE Regional Health Fora. 
Sinn Féin believes there are few issues of greater importance than the health of our people. The provision of healthcare of 
12 Our proposals in the context of this local government election are based on our policy Healthcare in an Ireland of Equals. 
the highest standard must be a key concern of our democracy, including at local government level. Regardless of the current lack of local powers over healthcare provision, we will use all our influence as local elected representatives to deliver the changes and the services required. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Change: 
»  Replacement of our current two-tier inequitable and  inefficient healthcare system with a new universal public  health system for Ireland that provides care to all free at the  point of delivery on the basis of need alone.  
»  Establishment of new democratically accountable  Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) responsible for  the delivery of all healthcare within their geographically  defined areas, irrespective of the border. CHPs to be  managed by a cooperative of local public representatives,  service users, advocates, health professionals and systems  experts. They will oversee the strategic planning and  management of community-based services and local  hospital services. For the first time, local health needs will  be at the centre of planning and delivering local health  services. CHPs will develop comprehensive Community  Health Improvement Plans that both make best use of the  health resources available and also identify future needs.13  
»  Independent Patient and Carer Advocacy Services within  each CHP area, supplementary to a Health Ombudsperson  operating as a regulatory body for service users and their  families.  
»  The retention and further development of the maximum  feasible range of services at local hospitals and the  provision of quality hospital care for all, regardless  of income or geographic location. A halt to the over­ centralisation of hospital facilities, reversal of cutbacks  in services at local hospitals and a national plan for the  provision and resourcing of hospital care, including clear  access targets within an equality framework.  
»  A network of modern and accessible fully public Primary  Care Treatment Centres run by properly resourced multi­ disciplinary and multi-agency Primary Care Teams. Kickstart  this process by completing the rollout of the promised  Primary Care Centres on an accelerated timetable. Appoint  salaried GPs to work in the Primary Care Teams and  negotiate to phase-in salaried contracts for all other GPs.  
»  Pending establishment of fundamental reforms, establish  a Health Strategic/Municipal Policy Committee for every  local authority. Local and regional HSE management should  be required to work directly with these SPCs, including accountability to regular meetings held in public. These Health SPCs should replace the current Regional Health Fora. 

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Use the forum of local councils and where appropriate our  seats on the HSE Fora, to promote equity and efficiency in  healthcare provision and to vindicate the healthcare rights  of our communities.  
»  Work with communities and healthcare workers to  campaign for delivery of the best possible local healthcare  services.  
»  Campaign against health cutbacks, including the HSE  recruitment embargo and against centralisation and  privatisation of hospital services.  
»  Work as effective advocates for individuals seeking their  rights to access health services.  
»  Call for routine mapping and publication of local health  statistics, including death rates from diseases, at county, city  and town or borough level.  
»  Propose local public information campaigns to enhance  awareness of local mental health and suicide prevention  services, campaign for necessary improvements and  additional resources to increase local service access while  reducing caseloads on individual healthcare workers and  support more training in community-based prevention  programmes such as ASSIST.  


Addiction Services 
Problems with addiction – to alcohol, to prescription drugs and to illegal drugs – have become widespread in modern Ireland, blighting the lives of individuals, their families and our communities. 
Many effective interventions are available to assist people to overcome addiction, or at least to minimise its most harmful effects. Yet many of these crucial services are not available in our local communities.  This means people who desperately need help sit on waiting lists, or must travel long distances for treatment, or simply never get access at all.  Often the only service available locally is not the right one for the individual, so people continue to go without. This is wrong. When appropriate addiction services are not available it makes these people even more vulnerable to the predatory drinks and drugs industries, locking them, their families and communities into addiction-related harm. 
Sinn Féin has a long history of confronting the causes and consequences of addiction. We will continue to campaign for a more effective and holistic response to the drugs and alcohol crisis in this state, of which the provision of full spectrum addiction services is a crucial part. Local authorities can play an important role in supporting the provision of addiction and other harm reduction services. Our councillors will continue to use all their influence as public representatives – including their positions on Local/Regional/Rural Drugs Task Forces – to fight for delivery of these necessary supports to local communities. 

Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Changes: 
»  Provision of full spectrum addiction services (for alcohol,  prescription drugs, illegal drugs and solvents) for all who  need them.  
»  No more addiction treatment waiting lists. Treatment made  available as soon as the addicted person is ready for help.  
»  An immediate increase in the provision of residential  treatment beds.  
»  Extra resources to combat the growing problem of cocaine  and crack cocaine use and addiction.  
»  Restriction on the number and type of outlets where  alcohol is sold, the number of licenses granted and the  hours and days of sale.  
»  Involvement of local authorities and local communities  in the liquor licensing control process.  Local Licensing  Fora should include elected representatives, statutory  authorities, licensed trade representatives, community  representatives and other stakeholders such as those  involved in addiction services. Licenses should be awarded  individually and on the basis of good practice and subject  to annual review for compliance history.  Group licensing  should end.  
»  A Local/Regional/Rural Drugs Task Force for every area  where need is identified, to include representation of local  elected representatives.  


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Work with addiction service providers to identify local service gaps and lobby for necessary resources. Oppose funding cuts for services or for Local/Regional/Rural Drugs Task Forces. 
» Call for provision of local residential treatment such that users need not face unnecessary isolation from their children, family or other social supports as they recover. 
» Promote communication, coordination and cooperation between service providers and local communities. 
» Promote and support establishment of local alcohol and drug-free social environments including late opening cafés in all villages, towns and city districts. 
» Ensure local sports and cultural facilities which can support people avoiding or overcoming addiction are affordable  and accessible to all.  
» Advocate to ensure that no person attempting to overcome  addiction is denied accommodation, healthcare, or  education and training on this basis alone.  
» Engage with, support and lobby for adequate funding for  their Local/Regional/Rural Drugs Task Force.  
» Work directly with communities worst-affected by alcohol- related public disorder and the illegal drugs trade. Lobby  for increased RAPID and CLÁR funding for proven effective  prevention resources to disadvantaged areas hardest hit  and where individuals are most at risk.  
»  Promote awareness programmes and harm reduction  education and services to reduce unnecessary deaths by  alcohol poisoning/solvent use/overdose, HIV or Hepatitis C.  


Postal Services 
Hundreds of local post offices have disappeared from rural Ireland, mostly in the West. In the past ten years, more than one in four post offices in the state have closed and this trend is accelerating, with few full-time offices remaining. These closures are hitting those in rural areas hardest, especially older people who have to travel longer and longer distances to receive their pensions. 
For many people, the local post office has acted as a meeting and contact point for neighbours they might rarely see otherwise. Not only do these closures deprive local communities of an essential service but they exacerbate problems of isolation and the general decline of rural areas. 
All residents have the right to the same level of provision of public services. If the state presides over the destruction of rural post offices, alongside the downgrading of hospitals and transport and the closure of schools and Garda stations, then it is failing in its obligation to ensure that this is the case. 
Without a national strategy backed by local leadership, the local post office as we know it is in grave danger of becoming extinct. 
Sinn Féin is totally opposed to the full or partial privatisation of An Post, as it provides a vital public service and we are on record as strongly rejecting the deregulation of the postal service. Public assets such as An Post should be kept in public ownership and under democratic control, with universal service provision guaranteed. Big business is the only winner from privatisation and liberalisation while society as a whole suffers through lack of universal postal services and job losses. 
There are many options for keeping An Post and rural post offices viable, through the diversification of its services.  For example: providing door-to-door delivery of parcels and welfare payments such as pensions to people with impaired mobility; providing a daily necessities ordering service for elderly people; combining postal services with council services to provide an insurance and taxation one-stop shop; combining postal services with Business Points; developing post offices as centres of community service information for example on local transport and childcare; and providing space for community activities such as community meetings. 

Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Campaign with local communities to end the closure of  post offices throughout the country.  
»  Campaign to keep An Post as a public asset under public  control.  
»  Support the diversification of An Post to keep the service  viable.  
»  Propose a Public Service Intervention Order to enable the  subvention of post offices in rural areas along the Western  Seaboard region to ensure post masters’ incomes are  brought to the minimum wage as a matter of priority.  
»  Call for special funding to county councils as matter of  priority, to roll out the subvention and prevent post offices  from closing. Such an intervention should be a companion  to an overall reform package to enable postal services  scheduled for closure to deliver more social services.  


Strengthening Equality and Diversity 
The diversity of our communities is their strength. But local decisions and services do not always meet everyone’s different needs. Such services and local power structures usually favour the majority, while ignoring or excluding minorities such as Irish language speakers, people with disabilities, people from New Communities, or Travelling people.  In the case of women, children and older people, they may not be ‘minorities’ but the disempowerment they also experience is no less real. This inequality does not just affect the individuals and groups who experience a lower quality of life as a consequence of discrimination. By ensuring these people cannot reach their full potential or make their full contribution, it weakens the social fabric for everyone. 
Sinn Féin is committed to building an inclusive Ireland of Equals. This must start at local community level.  We will use our powers and influence within local authorities to ensure that all decisions are taken with a view to their impact on equality. All policy decisions, all spending decisions, all planning decisions, all service decisions should contribute to making our communities more equal, not less. Sinn Féin Will Fight for the Following Fundamental Change: 
»  All decisions taken by local authorities in the 26 Counties to become subject to an ‘equality-proofing’ mechanism such  as that applying to all public policy and spending decisions  in the 6 Counties – as required under the Good Friday  Agreement.  
»  Local authorities to actively seek the regular input of local  
women, children, older people, people with disabilities,  Irish language speakers, New Communities and Travelling  communities on matters affecting them to better inform  public decision-making and to ensure delivery of services  that respond to the needs of all.  
»  Adoption by all councils of affirmative action policies to redress underrepresentation of groups experiencing  discrimination in public employment and in the award of  council contracts.

An Ghaeilge, the first language of the nation, one of two official languages in the state, still does not enjoy an equal place in our communities. Irish speakers cannot access the same spectrum of local services in Irish as in English. This fact and other economic incentives and realities continue to favour English and put the use of Irish under pressure even in na Gaeltachtaí. Despite the efforts of under-resourced Irish language advocacy groups, there is still not enough support for those Gaeilgeorí who want to use Irish in daily life, those with cúpla focail who want to improve their Irish, or members of New Communities who want to embrace the language in their adopted home. 
There is plenty of scope for local authorities to play their part in the advancement of the Irish language in their area. Sinn Féin will work with all interested others to help grow an Ghaeilge in each and every one of our communities. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Work with local Irish language sectoral organisations to  identify priorities and make local councils more responsive to their needs.  
»  Support full implementation of the Official Languages Act at local level.  
»  Propose that each council adopt an Irish Language  Promotion Strategy and appoint an Irish Language  Development Officer responsible for its implementation.  
»  Support the interests of local Gaelscoileanna and stand with parents and teachers in demanding the retention of Irish language immersion education.  
»  Propose and insist on Irish names for new roads and estates.  
»  Ensure development of distinct Local Area Plans for na  Gaeltachtaí, in consultation with socio-linguistic experts, to both protect the Irish language as a community language  and increase the viability of these areas.  
»  Ensure councils use local arts and sports funding to  promote Irish language arts and other activities.  
»  Make efforts to improve their own level of Irish and to use it regularly in public business.  

Platform for Women 
More than a century after the birth of Irish suffragism, women have come a long way, but still do not enjoy equal status in our communities. They are still more likely to carry principal childrearing duties and thus earn less and have lower incomes at all stages of life.  They are still likely to live in fear of domestic or sexual violence.  They face ongoing barriers to higher education, to better employment and women continue to be underrepresented in leadership, management and public life. 
It’s not just that women can lead.  In our local communities, women do lead.  With more effective support from local authorities, women could do even better. Sinn Féin is committed to ensuring that all councils take more seriously their duty to promote women’s equality for the benefit of all. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Work with local women’s organisations to identify priorities, make local councils more responsive to women’s needs and  to promote the status of women in all our communities.  
»  Support the adoption and ensure the monitoring of  affirmative action policies to increase hiring and promotion  of equally able women in council employment and in the  award of council contracts. Highlight gender imbalance  where it occurs on all councils, Committees and Boards.  
»  Ensure each council adopts official policies and guidelines on domestic violence, in consultation with local women’s support services.  
»  Ensure all councils work with the Gardaí and local women’s support services to conduct Women’s Safety Audits of all  city districts, towns and villages.  
»  Call for a review of the social housing points systems to ensure fair allocations for single women with children, with  priority for women fleeing domestic violence and advocate  for the provision of at least one refuge in each county.  
»  Support equal access for all to good quality childcare, oppose the fundamentally flawed Community Childcare  Subvention Scheme and support provision or restoration of  core funding to all local community-based crèches.  
»  Use positions on Development Boards to support initiatives  promoting women’s entrepreneurship, including expansion  of Women Enterprise Networks, more aggressive promotion  of women in rural enterprise and the sourcing and granting  of micro-finance start-up funds.  
»  Ensure councils use local arts, sports and community  funding to promote inclusion of women and also support  the funding of specific local women’s groups and women’s  services.  

Platform for Children and Young People 
Children and young people are the backbone of our communities’ future. Yet so many of our local services don’t meet their real needs. So many of our communities are planned in a way that interferes with their best interests and best chances for optimal development. So much of daily life at local level fails them and in doing so fails us all. 
Local authorities must bring the needs and best interests of children and young people – an investment in our future – to the centre of all decisions and plans.  Sinn Féin will use our powers and influence at council level to ensure that local government cherishes all the children of the nation equally by paying special attention to the needs of children from low income families and doing everything possible to ensure they get the best start. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Work with local children’s advocacy and service organisations to identify priorities and make local councils more responsive to children’s needs.  
»  Support emerging leadership among young people through the establishment of Youth Councils, to provide a forum for structured consultation and advice to local authorities.  
»  Ensure local development plans adequately provide for schools and childcare facilities and frontload building of community facilities relevant to children, with onus on the developer.  
»  Ensure all development plans include child and youth amenities to build safer communities (ie. green areas, playgrounds/skateboard parks, sports and recreation centres, libraries and culture and arts spaces).  
»  Ensure that all development plans for towns with a population of 1,000 or more include the provision of one-stop recreational centres (including facilities such as a cinema, bowling alley, swimming pool and youth café).  
»  Ensure that all councils focus on the provision of age appropriate sports and recreational facilities:  
» For children: a centrally located playground in each population centre (village, pre-village/low order settlement and urban development).  
» For young people: sports and recreation facilities including skateboard parks and tennis/basketball courts, to be provided in existing open spaces under local authority ownership.  
»  Ensure that children and young people from low income families are not excluded from participation in arts, sports and recreation due to cost considerations.  
»  Initiate Child Safety Audits (including pedestrian and cyclist safety) of all cities, towns and villages.  
»  Use membership of Joint Policing Committees with a view to ensuring sufficient support for high risk children and  children from high risk areas and increasing the number of juvenile liaison officers and local diversion programmes.  
»  See also all commitments under the subsections on Education and Childcare.  

Platform for Older People 
After a lifetime’s contribution to building our communities, it is unjust that in their older years many people find themselves isolated and excluded from community life. Our villages, towns and cities, our public buildings, transportation and thoroughfares – often even their very own homes – are not generally designed to help older people cope with decreasing mobility. Though their needs may be greater, many pensioners still cannot access needed services or amenities because of lack of available or affordable transportation. 
Local authorities don’t always extend older people ‘the Nation’s gratitude and consideration’ as they should. Sinn Féin will use our influence on local councils to ensure that our communities continue to respect, include and make provision for people at all ages and stages of life. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Work with local organisations representing older people to identify priorities and make local councils more responsive to their needs. 
» Ensure local authorities age-proof mainstream services (such as Assisted Bin Collection schemes) and adapt or provide specific services for older peoples’ needs (such as Falls Prevention schemes, sufficient seating provision in public areas, etc), in consultation with older people themselves. 
» Ensure all new builds meet universal design standards to prevent the need for later adaptation by older residents experiencing a decline in mobility. 
» Lobby the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Local Government to demand that funding for housing adaptations keeps pace with actual local need. 
» Support a requirement that all local public transport be made accessible to those with impaired mobility. 
» Take action to secure the provision of more public buses in rural areas and also support community-based rural transport initiatives. 
» Initiate pedestrian safety audits of all cities, towns and villages, with a view to ensuring safe provision for older pedestrians. 
»  Campaign with local communities to end the closure of post offices throughout the country, particularly in rural areas, to ensure older people can access their pensions without difficulty and to combat their social isolation.  
»  Propose provision of outdoor gyms such as that recently developed in Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath (facilities including various pieces of equipment designed to improve joint mobility, muscle strength and increase overall activity levels in older people) and hydrotherapy facilities at all swimming pool complexes owned or part-owned by councils.  
»  Use membership of Joint Policing Committees to ensure policing better meets the security needs of vulnerable older people. Support community-based voluntary schemes that provide vigilance on behalf of and other supports for, older people living alone.  
»  Ensure local nursing homes are regularly inspected to guard against abuse and neglect of older people in such facilities. Oppose staff cutbacks in public nursing homes, which  
undermines quality of care.  

Platform for People With Disabilities 
People with disabilities have come a long way in raising Irish consciousness about and campaigning for their equal rights. But there is still so far to go. Our communities still discriminate against and exclude people with disabilities. In every local area without exception, buildings, housing, transport, thoroughfares, education, employment, cultural life – are all still generally designed for people without disabilities. It is long past time for change. 
Local authorities must do everything in their power to end discrimination against people with disabilities and to make our communities and local services accessible to people of all abilities. Indeed, most local authorities have committed to do so by endorsing the Barcelona Declaration on disability awareness, access, policy-proofing and impact assessment.  Sinn Féin will use our seats on local councils to make sure this happens. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
» Work with local disabled peoples’ organisations and advocacy groups to identify priorities, make local councils more responsive to their needs and make communities and all services more inclusive and accessible. 
» Initiate accessibility audits of all cities, towns and villages as well as local Development Plans, service plans and other strategies and ensure planning decisions and expenditur concentrated on making all public buildings, thoroughfares, services and amenities accessible for people with disabilities. 
» Ensure each council has a Disability Access Officer to inspect planning applications. 
»  Ensure provision for independent living within mixed tenure estates.  
»  Review the social housing points systems to ensure fair allocations with a priority on equal access for people with disabilities.  
»  Ensure new builds meet universal design standards and require planning applications to include a specific certification to this effect from the Association of Building Engineers or the Royal Institute of Architects.  
»  Lobby the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Local Government to demand that funding under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability and the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme keeps pace with actual local need.  
»  Support a requirement that all local public transport be made accessible to those with impaired mobility.  
»  Ensure councils use local arts and sports funding to promote inclusion of people with disabilities.  
»  Support the adoption and ensure the monitoring of affirmative action policies to increase hiring and promotion of people with disabilities in council employment.  

Platform for New Communities 
People from New Communities have much to contribute to our villages, towns and cities – socially, culturally and economically 
– and are now a significant percentage of the local population. Whether they have come to study, to work or to seek refuge from persecution in their home country, their arrival has breathed new life into many areas and the best of Irish people have made them welcome and treated them as equals. However, some have had negative experiences such as racist abuse – from verbal assaults to violence. Some face discrimination or racism by landlords or employers who seek to exploit their vulnerable status. Others have difficulties due to a lack of planning in public services or in targeted programmes that address their specific needs.  For still others, government policy puts up barriers to their equality. For example, people seeking protection are not allowed by the state to work or pay taxes and have no choice where they live while they wait for a decision on their application, which can take years. During this time they receive only a very reduced social welfare payment of €19.10 per week. They and their children are consigned to living on the margins of our society and in poverty, often under degrading conditions shown to put their mental health at risk. 

Local authorities must do all in their power to make people from New Communities welcome and to ensure that local services address their needs too. Sinn Féin will show leadership on councils and in our communities by promoting interculturalism, integration, equality and meaningful social inclusion of New Communities and strongly opposing racism in every form. 


Sinn Féin Councillors Will: 
»  Work with local New Community led-organisations, intercultural advocacy groups and residents’ groups in refugee hostels to identify priorities and make local councils more responsive to their needs.  
»  Promote the inclusion of New Communities in local consultation and planning processes, ensuring the representation of these communities on local bodies and inclusion in decision-making.  
»  Promote interculturalism and integration in design and delivery of all local services and plans, including necessary outreach and consultation.  
»  Ensure all council contractors comply with labour laws and treat all workers equally regardless of status or country of origin.  
»  Review the social housing points systems to ensure fair and non-discriminatory allocations based on need and ensure the council targets outreach information at New Communities to increase awareness of their rights to social and affordable housing.  
»  Campaign to end the unjust Direct Provision System. In the meantime, ensure local direct provision refugee hostels are regularly inspected for human rights violations and full compliance with applicable standards and their management held to account.  
»  Oppose segregated schooling.  Promote local education and childcare provision more responsive to the needs of New Community children and their families, including targeted programmes where appropriate.  
»  Ensure councils use local arts, sports and community funding to promote interculturalism, integration and  
development of New Communities. Support funding of local community projects either representing or specifically outreaching to New Communities.  
»  Use our positions on Joint Policing Committees to ensure that all racist incidents are taken seriously and those responsible for racist attacks are brought to justice.  
»  Challenge racism whenever and wherever it occurs. Promote the implementation of Anti-Racism and Integration Development Plans at local level.  


Platform for Travellers 
Travellers remain the most marginalised group in Irish society. Many still live at the side of the road or in informal unserviced halting sites without electricity, water, sewerage or waste disposal. In general, they have significantly lower educational attainment than settled people. than settled people. Consequently, their incomes are lower and unemployment levels higher. Poor diet and sanitary conditions means they get sick and die earlier. Settled people generally feel freer to make derogatory comments about Travellers than any other group, to bar them from hotels, pubs and shops, or to refuse them employment or school places. Gardaí are known to treat Travellers, as individuals and groups, with a heavy hand. Hostility from settled residents often brings Travelling communities into local conflicts and hate crime against them is not uncommon.  

Local authorities have an obligation to uphold Travellers’ rights as equal citizens.  Many social problems could be solved if local councils met Traveller needs for accommodation in particular. Sinn Féin will use our council positions to make this so and to ensure that all local services also consider and meet Traveller needs.  

Sinn Féin Councillors Will:  
» Work with local Traveller organisations to identify priorities and to make local councils more responsive to their needs.  
» Promote the inclusion of Travellers in local consultation and planning processes, ensuring their representation on local bodies and inclusion in decision-making.  Ensure interculturalism and integration in design and delivery of all local services and plans, including necessary outreach to and consultation with Travellers.  
» Visit and report on conditions in unserviced halting sites.  
» Ensure full and timely delivery of local Traveller Accommodation Plans that include a range of accommodation options including Traveller-specific sites, mainstream social housing, Traveller affordable housing, extension of the tenant purchase scheme and clustering in new developments.  
» Review the social housing points systems to ensure fair allocations to Travellers.  
» Oppose segregated schooling. Promote local education and childcare provision more responsive to the needs of Traveller children and their families, including targeted programmes where appropriate.  
» Ensure councils use local arts, sports and community funding to promote interculturalism, integration and development of Travelling Communities. Support funding of local community projects either representing or specifically outreaching to Travellers.  
» Promote ongoing and constructive dialogue between local Traveller and settled communities on matters of shared concern.  
» Use our positions on Joint Policing Committees to open dialogue between local Traveller and Garda leadership, to ensure that racist attacks and other incidents are taken

"EP 2004: Fine Gael","OUR EUROPEAN UNION

From the very start, the concept of European integration and co-operation was an ambitious project. The pledge of sovereign countries to work together, in close co-operation, has transformed an historically divided Europe into one that is peaceful, stable and prosperous.

Our European Union is unique. It has come about from the free choice of the peoples of Europe. Together, we have forged a partnership based on our common values of respect for human rights, liberty, peace, democracy and economic stability.

Ireland must be at the very heart of this co-operative European Union, for it is there that our interests are best served.
• Ireland needs economic growth and secure employment.
• Ireland needs a competitive and dynamic economy, with an emphasis on regulatory reform, value for money and consumer protection.
• Ireland needs peace and security, at home and abroad.
• Ireland needs to be part of a progressive, forward thinking group of European countries that place a high value on education, equality of opportunity and personal liberty of movement and expression.

Today, the European Union is changing at a faster rate than ever before. And in a European Union that has grown beyond expectation, Ireland needs the strongest possible team to represent it within the single largest political, economic and trading bloc in the world.

In June, you will pick that team. For Ireland’s future, select the people that you know will be able to meet the challenges, and maximise the benefits, of Ireland’s membership of the European Union in the 21st century.

Now more than ever, Ireland needs the most capable, articulate and hard working MEPs that we can get. This Fine Gael team will meet the challenge.

On June 11th, empower them to work… on your side.

Our European Union is unique. It has come about from the free choice of the peoples of Europe. Together, we have forged a partnership based on our common values of respect for human rights, liberty, peace, democracy and economic stability.

FINE GAEL – THE PARTY OF EUROPE

When Ireland joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, we joined a community of nine Member States: now, the EU boasts a membership of 25, with further expansion planned.

This larger community offers us greater opportunities, but also greater challenges. And in a changing world, the EU will assume even greater importance and influence.

Since joining this common European partnership, Ireland has been transformed economically, politically and socially. For Ireland’s future, we must continue to play an active role in EU developments. And, whilst Ireland is more geographically remote than other Member States within the Union, we must never become politically at a distance.

The European Union is an evolving partnership. However, by failing to take an active role in the development of key structures at European level, the Government continues to sideline Ireland in a way that is unacceptable. For example, Fine Gael believes that Ireland must play an active role in the future peace of Europe, and the wider world. By not having a view on common foreign and security arrangements, the Government is signing Ireland out of a decisionmaking process that is critical to our future.

There are some who will say that Ireland’s membership of the European Union has diluted our national sovereignty. I challenge this assessment. Certainly, in some areas we have decided to pool decision making with other European Union Member States where we feel that this is acceptable and to our benefit. In these cases, we have as much say in their future as they have in ours.

However, in many ways, Ireland was not a fully sovereign State until we joined the European Union. In the past, our biggest export was our people, a British devaluation forced an Irish devaluation automatically, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer set interest rates, our exports were totally dependent upon a British market and our employment was over reliant on agriculture.

Today, all this has changed. We have a say at the European Central Bank. We have a healthy manufacturing and pharmaceutical base. Our financial services industries provide thousands of jobs as well as almost one third of all corporation taxes. And a thriving tourism industry has been assisted by EU investment in our infrastructural development.

The European Union has nurtured the growth of peace and prosperity in Europe for over half a century. Now, with our greatest enlargement, we must ensure that it can continue to provide the framework within which the whole continent of Europe can prosper into the future.

Fine Gael is the party of Europe. We are committed to an EU of close, mutually beneficial co-operation. This is the best way, this is the only way, to ensure the continuation of Ireland’s peace, stability and prosperity.

Since joining this common European partnership, Ireland has been transformed economically, politically and socially. For Ireland’s future we must continue to play an active role in EU developments.

THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE’S PARTY

At European level, Fine Gael is a member of the Christian Democrat grouping, the European Peoples’ Party (EPP) in the European Parliament. The EPP is the largest political grouping in Europe.

Member parties of the EPP stand for equality of opportunity, social justice and reward for effort and enterprise. The EPP aims to build an EU that is united, open, humane and diverse. Fine Gael shares these core values and aims.

Throughout its history the EPP has worked consistently to ensure that the EU evolves on the foundations of the primacy of law and respect for fundamental rights. The EPP believes this should be achieved through the sharing of power and through independent democratic institutions so as to ensure future progress serves the common interest of all Europeans.

The EPP stands for the equality of women and men, the protection of the rights of the child and minority rights, respect for life and human dignity, support for the family and solidarity with the most vulnerable in our society. The EPP stands firmly against the scourge of racism, which is a blight on modern Europe and must be tackled proactively.

We know from experience that private initiative, free enterprise, competition and free trade are driving forces behind economic progress. Of course, the freedom to do business and receive a fair profit from it is balanced by the obligation to obey the law, show respect for the environment, and work towards social development.

The EPP supports the development of a European Constitution to guarantee the common good of all European citizens. Additionally, the EPP is in favour of international co-operation so as to resolve conflicts via peaceful channels of negotiation and arbitration.

THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION

Fine Gael strongly supports the draft Constitutional Treaty for the European Union, and believes that a stronger European Union is good for Ireland.

The draft Constitutional Treaty is not only a strong statement of values; it is a firm statement of European constitutional law governing the actions of the European Union. It provides all of us with a bedrock from which we can build a structure of peace for this generation, and generations to come.

Importantly, the draft Constitutional Treaty will make an EU of 25 Member States more intelligible to the citizens of Europe, and introduce reforms that streamline the workings of the EU and facilitate decision-making in the enlarged Union.

The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as an integral part of the draft Constitutional Treaty, is a major step forward. This brings human values right to the heart of the EU, and will guarantee that the EU will respect these rights in its own work in all Member States. Additionally, the draft Constitutional Treaty provides that a country may be suspended from the EU if it fails to respect the values of human dignity, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.

By bringing everything together in one document, the draft Constitutional Treaty will be simpler, easier to read and more accessible to the European public than previous EU Treaty documents. This should promote greater levels of inclusion and discussion, which are fundamental to the quality of participative democracy that Fine Gael wants to achieve.

The draft Constitutional Treaty does not allow the EU to raise taxes, run budget deficits, raise a military force or act outside the competences given to it by the Member States.

MAKING EUROPE MORE DEMOCRATIC

The European Union has done great things for the people of Europe. But even though it has given them peace, jobs and freedom of movement, people still feel remote from it. While people can vote for their own local MEP, they do not feel that they use their vote to change the Government of the European Union in the same way as they can use their vote to change their National Government.

This situation must be altered so that citizens will, in future, feel that they are the ones who really run the European Union. Fine Gael has a proposal that would bring this change about.

Europe’s triangle of institutions – the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers – are, of course, somewhat different from the institutions that run an individual country. But Fine Gael believes that the time has come to allow all the people of Europe to vote, directly and together, to choose the head of one of Europe’s main institutions. Such an election would be a truly “European” election, where all Europeans would be making the same choice on the same day. In that way, people would come to feel that their vote really counts in the European Union. They would feel part of the Union.

Fine Gael, therefore, proposes that the President of the European Commission be elected directly by all the people of Europe in a single ballot on a ""one person, one vote"" basis.

Fine Gael accepts, however, that the remainder of the Commission members would continue to be appointed on the present basis where every country, large and small, would have an equal right to a Commissioner. We also accept that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament would also retain their existing powers.

But the direct election of the President of the Commission by all the people of Europe would give them a real say in the direction the Union would take. A directly elected President of the Commission would also have the added moral authority of a mandate from all the people, even though he/she would be working with all the other institutions and the Member States within a balanced framework.

To be a candidate for election as President of the Commission, a person would have to be nominated by a minimum number of MEPs and a minimum number of members of different national parliaments. A possible formula could be nomination by 15% of MEPs and 15% of members of at least eight national parliaments.

This Fine Gael proposal would make everyone feel they were really part of the European project, and would help people to identify much more closely with the European Union.

SECURITY IN A CHANGING EUROPE – TACKLING TERRORISM AND TRAFFICKING

The growth of European partnership and co-operation, arising from the conflicts of the 20th century, has offered EU citizens a high degree of peace, stability and security.

However, in the wake of the terrorist atrocity in Madrid it is apparent that the European Union must provide for greater common action to combat serious threats to future security.
• Fine Gael supports the expansion of Europol to prevent and combat serious crimes with an international dimension;
• Fine Gael believes that Eurojust, the European Union body established in 2002 to assist in the effectiveness of the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border crime, should be developed to enhance crosscommunity co-operation and communication in the fight against crime;
• Fine Gael believes that measures against serious crimes such as the trading in enslaved women, drug trafficking, Internet related crime, money laundering and acts of racism should be harmonised throughout the European Union in all national legal systems to establish comparable EU standards;
• Fine Gael supports the creation of a European Public Prosecutor;
• Fine Gael supports the provisions of the draft European Constitution that would allow for majority voting on a number of cross-border criminal issues. This is necessary to ensure that minimum standards are attained, not only to ensure that there are no “safe havens” in Europe for particular types of crime, but also to guarantee minimum rights to defendants throughout Europe.

EU & NORTH AMERICAN RELATIONS

The enlarged EU, accounting for a quarter of the world’s GNP and more than 450 million people, will be a Union of weight, of wealth and of influence. However, at this time of European change and transformation it is important that we do not allow important relationships with States outside the EU to become marginalised.

In particular, Europe and North America have a shared history and experience, and Europe’s relationship with the United States of America (US) and Canada should not be neglected in the future.

The deep historical links between Europe and North America are underlined by the importance of present day EU/US bilateral economic relations. The EU and the US are each other’s single largest trading partner and each other’s most important source and destination for foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2002 alone, two way cross-border trade in goods and services between the EU and the US amounted to more than €650 billion. Transatlantic trade represents 39% of EU and 35% of US total cross-border trade in services.

However, transatlantic tensions have increased, and the EU/US relationship has been subject to considerable stresses. The conflict in Iraq has been the source of the greatest transatlantic disagreement of recent times. At a time when transatlantic disagreements are more common and the EU becomes larger and more independent, it would be all too easy to marginalise our relationship with the United States and Canada.

Fine Gael believes that this would be a deeply retrograde step. For that reason, and in order to reaffirm the importance of transatlantic dialogue, Fine Gael is proposing the establishment of a Foundation for Transatlantic Co-operation.

The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as an integral part of the draft Constitutional Treaty, is a major step forward. This brings human values right to the heart of the EU.

Using Shannon as a base for its development, this foundation would have the potential to encourage transatlantic dialogue, and to harness existing European and North American co-operation and goodwill.

There is too much at stake, not only in terms of trade but also common history, experience and culture, to allow the transatlantic relationship to decline. The improved flow of information, and the opportunity for broad dialogue between European and North American leaders that would be a key part of our plans for the foundation, would enhance understanding and co-operation between both trading partners, uniting us in our common task of building a prosperous future for our peoples in the 21st century.

Fine Gael’s Foundation for Transatlantic Co-operation would have four key responsibilities:
• The Foundation would seek to promote understanding and co-operation between the continents by fostering political, cultural, business, trade union, religious and other links. The Foundation would be a centre of excellence that would promote common interests to the benefit of both Europe and North America;
• The Foundation would promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge, and provide the ways and means for greater co-operation based on democracy and the principles of international law;
• The Foundation would provide opportunities for the exchange of views between political, business, trade union and other leaders, in confidence where necessary, so as to create greater knowledge and understanding;
• The Foundation would carry out research on significant issues of concern to both continents. To assist in this objective, the Foundation would set up expert study groups made up of personnel from both continents to research agreed topics and to exchange views on these for publication. The University of Limerick, located close to Shannon Airport and offering postgraduate courses in European Integration and International Studies, could play a part in undertaking or facilitating this research.

COMMON EUROPEAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY

Fine Gael believes that there is nothing inherently moral in adopting a neutral stance on every issue, irrespective of the circumstances of each situation. Fine Gael also believes that the first duty of Government is to provide for the security of its people. This is a responsibility that is being neglected.

That is why we want Ireland to help design a common EU security and defence agreement, and to do it now while the opportunity arises. We want Ireland to get involved in the construction of such an agreement at an early stage so that we can join on our terms. Ireland should not only be part of the EU security and defence architecture, we should be one of the architects helping to design these systems to meet our needs, and our view of Europe’s needs.

In our ever-closer European Union, Ireland should play an active role in the emerging common defence and security arrangements. This is the best way to secure the safety of our people at home and abroad, and to fulfil our responsibilities to our EU neighbours and friends. Fine Gael believes that Ireland’s involvement in any future EU common security and defence system should be guided by five key commitments:
• The commitment to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations (UN);
• The commitment to the pursuit of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, and a promise never to use either type of weapon;
• The commitment to mutual defence with our EU neighbours, but with specific provisions that would allow Ireland decide whether to get involved in any conflict on a ‘case by case’ basis. If we are not at the negotiations now, then we cannot make sure that this is adopted as a rule of any further defence arrangement;
• The commitment to providing peacekeeping and peacemaking operations;
• The commitment to respect the right of other EU States to enter other military alliances.

We cannot simply sit back and do nothing. If Ireland does not contribute to the debate on a common EU security and defence policy then we cannot complain when a policy is unveiled that addresses the concerns and aspirations of other States, but not of Ireland.

Whether we like it or not, the reality is that European defence co-operation is up for discussion and there is a clear momentum towards a common arrangement. It is up to us to get involved in the discussion now. Otherwise, a common position will be agreed, and Ireland will face a ‘take it or leave it’ decision.

Doing nothing is the best way of ensuring that the end of Irish neutrality will come about on the least favourable terms for Ireland and with the rules written by others. The Fine Gael document Beyond Neutrality outlines in full detail our position on the issue of common European Union defence and security.

IRELAND - INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPERS AND THE ‘TRIPLE LOCK’

Ireland’s Defence Forces have a long and proud tradition as peacekeepers in service with the United Nations. However, before a contingent of the Defence Forces may be deployed, the peacekeeping operation must be specifically endorsed by a UN resolution, as well as being approved by Dáil Eireann and agreed within the Government. This is referred to as the ‘triple lock’.

Fine Gael believes that the current ‘triple lock’ system is excessively restrictive. For example, the Defence Forces could not take part in an EU peacekeeping force sent to Macedonia (FYROM), even though this force replaced NATO forces in the region and had both EU and UN support, though not a formal UN resolution.

A formal UN resolution on the matter was vetoed by China because Macedonia recognised Taiwan. This has resulted in Ireland being unable to participate in the EU backed mission that was requested by the President of Macedonia. A total of 13 EU countries and 14 non-EU countries are working together in Macedonia, but Ireland is excluded because we have failed to modernise our domestic legislation.

Fine Gael believes that Ireland’s Defence Forces should be allowed to take part in peacekeeping missions that are in keeping with the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations but which may not have the formal sanction of a UN resolution. This is provided for by the Charter of the United Nations itself.

In October 2003, Fine Gael published the International Peace Missions Deployment Bill to enable the Defence Forces to participate in peace missions that are in keeping with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter, once this is approved, on a case-by-case basis, by Dail Eireann. Fine Gael believes that this would allow for a more rational participation of Irish forces in peacekeeping activities.

Ireland’s Defence Forces should continue to be part of International UN Forces, but should also participate in other peace missions that are in keeping with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter where the representatives of the people in Dail Eireann so decide. No foreign Government should have a veto over our Defence Forces, as is the case at present.

The Government does not want to be confronted with a national debate on these issues and it is afraid to bring forward proposals to amend this legislation. The result is that our Defence Forces can be deployed in Liberia but not in a neighbouring State to the European Union where conditions are considerably safer. This is wrong, and should be changed.

THE RAPID REACTION FORCE

Fine Gael strongly supports the continued commitment of troops by Ireland to the Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), established during the Helsinki Summit in 1999. This force is mandated to undertake humanitarian and crisis management tasks, and Ireland has a significant and important role to play in this regard.

Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary General, has called for conflict prevention to be the cornerstone of collective security in the 21st century. This requires us to actively focus on the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, ethnic tensions, and inequality.

In addition to tackling the root causes of conflict, we also need an effective instrument that can protect people in crisis situations. Through the RRF, we have the capability to give assistance to those whose lives are threatened by war, and can also respond in a coherent and speedy manner to UN calls for peacekeeping forces.

5 million people died from war-related causes in the 1990s. On the passing of the tenth anniversary of genocide in Rwanda it is timely to reassess our international responsibilities, and the appalling consequences when we fail to meet them.

Fine Gael, in supporting Ireland’s involvement in the RRF, also calls for the reform of the ‘triple lock’.

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT

The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on 17 July 1998.

This is the first ever permanent, treaty-based, international criminal court established to promote the rule of law and ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished.

Ireland became a State Party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on April 11, 2002, and today 24 of 25 European Union Member States are signatories to the Statute.

However, the United States of America is unwilling to join the vast majority of European countries, Canada, 22 African countries, the 11 countries from Asia, and the 18 from Latin America and the Caribbean who have to-date recognised the role of the International Criminal Court.

Fine Gael believes in the the primacy of the International Criminal Court in investigating serious crimes of an international nature. At the highest level, discussions between the EU and the US need to be intensified to ensure that the International Criminal Court is not simply a ‘toothless tiger’, but has the support of all States, including the US.

Ireland’s membership of the EU has helped us to make progress in tackling the endemic inequalities that exist in our society. The principle that we are all equal has been advanced.

OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT AID

Fine Gael supports the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. These goals commit the international community to an expanded vision of development, one that vigorously promotes human development as the key to sustaining social and economic progress in all countries and recognizes the importance of creating a global partnership for development.

The European Union must strive to work towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which aim to:
1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger;
2. Achieve universal primary education;
3. Promote gender equality and empower women;
4. Reduce child mortality;
5. Improve maternal health;
6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;
7. Ensure environmental sustainability;
8. Develop a global partnership for development.

In September 2000 the Taoiseach announced that Ireland would meet the UN target for overseas aid spending by 2007. This committed Ireland to devoting 0.7% of our GNP to development aid by that date. The Taoiseach and his Government got plenty of international recognition for this, and yet our contribution to overseas aid has stalled at 0.41%, making the achievement of this aim more and more unlikely.

Aid is of critical importance to the developing world. In the 1990s the number of children who died from diarrhoea exceeded the number of people killed in armed conflict since the Second World War. Today just one in five children in sub-Saharan Africa finish primary school, whilst a pregnant woman is 100 times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth in sub-Saharan Africa than in Ireland.

The European Union Development Committee needs new powers to push this matter to the forefront of the EU agenda. Additionally, each European Union Presidency should assess the progress being made by every Member State towards the achievement of measurable objectives such as the allocation of 0.7% of GNP as development aid by 2007.

ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

Fine Gael is committed to the process of EU enlargement. In addition to the new States that acceded to the Union in May 2004, Fine Gael also believes that the ongoing negotiations to further enlarge the EU are of critical importance to both the EU and these potential Member States.

The substantial enlargement of the European Union offers Ireland and all other EU Member States considerable opportunities. The economic prosperity and stability of the EU can only be maintained if such conditions extend throughout Europe.

Ireland has benefited hugely from membership of the European Union, economically, socially and politically. In economic terms, Ireland’s membership of a common market for our goods and services has been critical in our recent successes.

In 2003, Ireland's exports of goods and services amounted to more than €109 billion. The EU single market has allowed our export trade to grow and to diversify, and has weakened the traditional over-dependence upon a small number of markets which so hampered growth in the past.

For example, exports to the EU from January to October 2003 accounted for 60% of total exports. Great Britain and Northern Ireland were the destination for 18% of Ireland’s exports, other EU States received 42%, USA and Canada received 22%, and the rest of the world received 18% of Ireland’s exports.

The enlargement of the European Union enlarges the single market area. As a nation heavily reliant upon export markets, this is good news for Ireland in particular.

Fine Gael supports the ongoing negotiations with countries seeking to join the European Union. The future membership of these countries of our European partnership will be good for the EU, good for the applicant countries, and good for Ireland.

CONTINUING THE BENEFITS TO THE EUROPEAN CITIZEN

Already, the citizens of Ireland derive considerable benefit from our membership of the EU:
• Citizens of Ireland have benefited not only from the freedom to travel, work, reside and use a single currency throughout the EU, but also from the recognition of their qualifications in other Member States;
• As a State, Ireland exports more than 90% of what we produce. Our membership of such a large common market area, which we have the freedom to sell into on a level playing field with all Member States, has allowed Ireland to become economically transformed in recent decades;
• Ireland's membership of the EU has helped us to make progress in tackling the endemic inequalities that exist in our society. The principle that we are all equal has been advanced. Furthermore, the EU continues to bring forward equality directives designed to combat discrimination;
• Ireland's membership of the EU has helped us to realise that our environment must be protected. Economic development must no longer equate with environmental destruction;
• Ireland's membership of the EU has been central to our economic success. Substantial Structural and Cohesion Funds contributed to economic growth, helping to finance investment in our infrastructure, education and training and productive sectors. Moreover, EU reforms and deregulation have transformed the marketplace, helping us grow our economy and the value of our exports.

Fine Gael wants to add full freedom of movement to the list of benefits already enjoyed by Irish citizens within the EU.

It is regrettable that Irish citizens travelling within the European Union are still required to show their passport. When in Government, Fine Gael negotiated an opt-in clause with regard to the Schengen Agreement, but it is not possible to exercise this clause without losing our Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom whilst that country remains outside Schengen.

Fine Gael believes that Irish citizens should be able to travel within the broader European Union on a document of lesser standing than a passport, a driving licence for example, whilst awaiting the full adoption of the Schengen Agreement by the United Kingdom. Fine Gael will continue to try to bring an end to passport use within the EU for EU citizens.

IMMIGRATION INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION

Immigration is a fact of modern European life, and is a necessary and welcome part of the fabric of the European Union.

Economic and demographic factors have made immigration an integral part of the EU’s future development, and immigration is necessary if the EU economy is to be sustained. This is due to the projected fall in the EU workingage population over the next 20 years, which could result in a sharp decline in overall employment and a real drop in EU living standards and growth.

Immigration is, therefore, not only desirable but is also necessary. In a European context, action is needed in three key areas:
• Integration policy should be holistic, addressing legal, economic, social, cultural and religious issues as well as civic participation and knowledge of political rights and duties;
• Illegal immigration should be addressed at EU level through increased border control and surveillance, cooperation with countries of origin, a co-ordinated visa policy, along with information sharing and police cooperation to stamp out the appalling practise of human trafficking;
• The EU should expand and co-ordinate its actions to address asylum applications, with comprehensive EUwide minimum standards of treatment for asylum applicants.

Fine Gael will publish a separate policy document concerning the development of an EU-wide approach to immigration.

NORTHERN IRELAND

Enhanced co-operation at EU level in tackling problems that affect the island of Ireland can only be of benefit to the people of the island as a whole and should be strongly supported.

Fine Gael also wishes to build strong cross-border and cross-community trading and cultural links, which we believe would be of benefit to both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Fine Gael is committed to peace and reconciliation, and we believe that this can be made a reality through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. For six years, we have strongly supported and defended the Good Friday Agreement. The principles underpinning it are those that Fine Gael has promoted for many years: reconciliation, power sharing and the absolute rejection of violence as a means of achieving political ends.

Throughout the EU, two thirds of private sector jobs are in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, and SMEs create the bulk of all new jobs. The role of the entrepreneur is vital to the future health of the European economy.

THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY – DYNAMIC AND COMPETITIVE

Fine Gael believes that our membership of the European Union offers tremendous advantages to Ireland and has been a major reason for our recent economic growth.

Since joining this European partnership, Ireland has finally begun to reach its economic potential. We must ensure that we continue to reap the benefits of EU membership, in conjunction with promoting stability and success throughout the EU as a whole.

However, although Ireland has been a strong economic player in recent years we are now starting to slide in terms of our competitiveness, which should be of concern to us all.

With the addition of ten new Member States to the Union, most of whom face economic hurdles more difficult than the ones we face, Ireland must ensure that the economic framework within Europe meets the needs of Ireland, of the existing Member States and the new Member States. To this end, Fine Gael commits itself in the next session of the European Parliament to:
• Reform the Stability and Growth Pact to allow infrastructural investment within a prudent fiscal framework;
• Reiterate our opposition to any attempt to dilute the unanimity requirement for tax harmonization.

Fine Gael will also fight for the best possible deal for Ireland with regard to post-2006 funding that will shape the Union for the rest of the decade.

SUPPORTING BUSINESS

Businesses, especially new start-ups, need support in their early days. Excessive administrative requirements can overburden new companies, and distract their attention from growing their customer base. At European level, Fine Gael believes that:
• All new legislation should be assessed in terms of its cost to companies and employment;
• ‘Red tape’ should be minimised;
• A new EU patent should be developed to protect the intellectual property of European companies.

Throughout the EU, two-thirds of private sector jobs are in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, and SMEs create the bulk of all new jobs. The role of the entrepreneur, that person who takes the risk and sets up a business, is vital to the future health of the European economy.

Entrepreneurial talent and motivation are the lifeblood of our future economic success, and should be fostered in every Member State.

CONSUMER PROTECTION

The European Union has enacted a wide range of consumer protection legislation.

However, it is clear that consumers continue to live in rip-off Ireland. Often, consumers do not get a good deal, and they do not yet have sufficient protection against fraudulent or negligent suppliers of goods and services.

And with the increased use of the Internet by companies and individuals for sourcing goods and services, the potential for rip-offs has increased considerably.

In tandem with significantly improved access to consumer protection services at home, like the establishment of a Consumer Rights Enforcer recently suggested by Fine Gael, we believe that the role of the EU in consumer protection must be enhanced considerably:
• A high standard of common rules and practices in the area of consumer protection should be established throughout the EU;
• The distribution of accessible and relevant consumer information must be guaranteed to enable consumers to make informed choices;
• When things go wrong, consumers need a basic standard of legal rights, regardless of what EU State they are based in, that they can understand and that they can act upon;
• Given the increasing number of cross-border consumer transactions within the EU, consumers need access to EU systems of arbitration and mediation that will apply throughout the Union.

TACKLING THE INSURANCE RIP-OFF

Fine Gael believes the European Union offers Irish consumers the very real opportunity to get the best deal they can in a range of goods and services. Further, Irish entrepreneurs are more and more looking to an expanded European market to grow their business.

But both these groups face one huge obstacle to a real, thriving free market - the lack of a Single European Insurance Market.

The cost of insurance to Irish consumers has more than trebled in the last three years. Young motorists are being driven off the road. Small businesses are threatened with closure because of soaring public liability insurance costs.

Fine Gael MEPs will spare no energy in pushing for the creation of one insurance market for all of Europe, thus fostering competition and driving insurance costs down.

EDUCATION

Receiving a good education is the best possible start in life, and gives people the greatest chance of personal fulfilment and employment as adults.

In March 2000, the European Council in Lisbon set out a ten-year strategy to make the EU the world's most dynamic and competitive economy. The Lisbon Strategy aims to drive job creation alongside social and environmental policies that ensure sustainable development and social inclusion.

However, the progress towards reaching this objective has been slow, and Ireland’s Presidency of the European Union has failed to kick-start the Lisbon Strategy. This strategy could offer the people of Europe a real and tangible improvement in their quality of life, but needs strong cross-Governmental support to become a reality.

If the EU is to be serious about achieving the targets set at Lisbon, then we need action on key issues affecting education.
• A public education system of the highest quality must be available to all EU citizens, whilst also respecting the existence of private education which provides for greater choice;
• Multilingualism must be promoted, especially at an early age, and right throughout the educational process;
• The promotion of new technologies in training and educational programmes should be supported;
• To combat educational disadvantage an EU wide task force on early school leaving should be established to promote the achievement of the highest possible school retention rates in each EU Member State. This task force could provide information to all Member States on specific initiatives that have proved successful in encouraging school retention;
• European education programmes must be developed to remove access obstacles and encourage student and teacher mobility. Furthermore, university courses and apprenticeships should incorporate study, travel, training or employment in other EU countries as part of an EU-wide drive to encourage further education and life long learning.

Education must be open and accessible to all EU citizens. Participation in education must stimulate people to take an active part in society, and further their social and personal growth. By developing individuals we will strengthen society as a whole.

MAKING CHILD SAFETY A PRIORITY

Ireland lags behind other EU Member States in our totally inadequate vetting procedures for people who, through employment or volunteer positions, have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.

Fine Gael has led the debate at home on the type of vetting procedures that we think should be put in place for teachers and other staff at schools, for staff at Health Boards, and for staff and volunteers at charitable, sporting and youth organisations.

However, we also believe that the European Union should take an active role in promoting basic vetting standards and procedures across all Member States. We need to ensure that certain EU Member States do not provide employment havens for potential abusers due to inadequate vetting procedures, such as those that exist in Ireland.

SUPPORTING YOUTH

15% of EU citizens under the age of 25 have neither a job nor are in full time study. This high level of youth unemployment indicates a considerable failing on the part of the EU and individual Member States. Fine Gael supports specific measures that would improve the prospects for youth employment. EU policies should promote entrepreneurial spirit amongst young people and encourage initiative and creativity.

Furthermore, young people’s mobility and employability should be supported through a flexible and efficient system of degree recognition throughout Europe.

We are committed to ensuring that the family farm is a viable option for those who wish to remain on the land. We are determined that all policy decisions must reflect and facilitate this aim.

A HEALTHY EUROPE

In 2001 there were 62 million people aged 65 and over in the EU, compared with 34 million in 1960. As the age profile of the EU changes, we must plan ahead now to meet the future health needs of the European citizen.

This presents us all with a considerable challenge. Already, it is estimated that there may be up to 100 million people across Europe living with chronic pain as a result of musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis. As the EU ages, arthritis and other rheumatic complaints are likely to present increasing challenges to the provision of effective healthcare.

Fine Gael supports action across all EU Member States to raise awareness of medical conditions that particularly affect older people, with a view to promoting an active and independent old age.

Fine Gael also supports the creation of a common European health budget to combat illnesses and diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Aids and cancer, that broadly speaking affect the citizens of all Member States equally.

Fine Gael believes that the European Union must mobilise global action and resources for health research to halt the spread of diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS that increasingly threaten all the people of the world. A European Union of 25 Member States has the political weight and influence to bring about decisive global action in these important areas. Additionally, the diseases that principally affect the developing world, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and malaria, get only a tiny fraction of the current drug research budgets. A breakthrough in the treatment of these diseases could save millions of lives.

Ireland has been successful in targeting some development aid in the fight against AIDS. However, much more needs to be done. Fine Gael believes that the EU must take the lead in research towards the development of easily administered and inexpensive AIDS treatments, which would be of particular assistance in the fight against AIDS in the developing world. There is no commercial incentive for the major pharmaceutical companies to develop this vaccine so the European Union should step in.

Ireland has the highest incidence of asthma in Europe and the 4th highest in the world. It directly affects 1 in 7 children and 1 in 20 adults. Fine Gael will promote at EU level support for research into the growing incidence of asthma in both adults and children.

In Ireland alone there are up to 7,000 asthma related hospital admissions a year and A&E visits are four times this figure. Between 80 and 100 people die in Ireland each year from asthma, and 30% of them are under 40 years of age. The more information people have about their condition and the more they understand it, the better they will be able to control their asthma, with less need for costly hospital admissions, and missed school and work days.

Fine Gael will support Europe-wide information initiatives to empower asthma sufferers so that their condition is not a barrier to their participation in sport and does not affect their education, work, home and social life.

Fine Gael also believes that people need greater information about the effects of both the prescription and nonprescription drugs that they take. The EU should establish a public information office that could answer general queries on the effects and uses of medications, in a way that does not prejudice the importance of the doctor / patient relationship.

ENSURING RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

Fine Gael ensured through the Reflection Group and the Amsterdam Treaty process that the needs of people with disabilities were specifically provided for. We must now build on that Treaty provision by ensuring that legislation, directives and regulations are introduced to meet the needs and concerns of disabled persons throughout the EU. This will be a priority for our MEP's as well as all Fine Gael Ministers and TD's, Senators and Councillors.

Fine Gael also supports and endorses, nationally and at EU level, the drafting of a comprehensive UN Convention to Promote and Protect the Rights and Dignity of People with Disabilities. We will support and promote the active participation of people with disabilities in the national and EU delegation to the convention process. We will assist and facilitate the wider dissemination of information on the process and the draft convention to people in Ireland, particularly those whose rights would be protected in such a convention.

Fine Gael also supports the enactment of comprehensive disability legislation in Ireland to vindicate the rights of people with a disability.

AGRICULTURE AND FOOD

Fine Gael recognises that the Mid-Term Review of CAP will bring significant changes to Irish agriculture. However, we are committed to ensuring that the family farm remains a viable option for those who wish to remain on the land. We are determined that all policy decisions, whether taken at national or EU level, must reflect and facilitate this aim.

Agricultural policy must seek to assist production and strive to develop a product which has both a competitive advantage and a market outlet. We are aware that some sectors of Irish agriculture face major changes post-CAP reform, particularly dairying, while others are almost certain to lose out, especially retired farmers and new entrants. Fine Gael is committed to finding and implementing measures to assist them.
• Live Animal Trade - Fine Gael recognises the importance of the live animal trade to the agriculture industry, and has raised its concerns with respect to the issue with the EU Commissioner. Fine Gael will press to ensure that EU proposals for reform of the live trade will include the inclusion of staging posts and that any EU proposals will not have a negative impact on the industry.
• Nitrates Directive - Fine Gael recognises the need to protect and improve our water quality. The implementation of the Nitrates Directive must be based on scientific fact so that no unnecessary burden is placed on farm practices. Fine Gael will work to ensure that adequate funding is provided for the development works required for storage and that the necessary derogations required in advance of this are obtained.
• Farm Partnerships - Fine Gael will examine all necessary regulations to ensure that farmers, who so desire, can enter into partnerships to improve efficiency without suffering any penalties. This will be encouraged in all farming sectors.
• Animal Breeding - Fine Gael will promote quality breeding in the suckler herd and will establish a programme of breeding improvement in conjunction the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation.
• Food Standards Authority - Fine Gael will extend the role and functions of the Food Safety Authority to encompass Food Standards to ensure that Irish produced foodstuffs can gain a competitive advantage by improving quality and labelling.
• Food Labelling - We will seek changes in EU Labelling Policy to ensure that the consumer knows what they are eating and to cease the practice of non-EU foodstuffs being passed off as home produce.
• Marketing - With the advent of the Single Farm Payment, Fine Gael will examine how best personnel can be redeployed within the Department of Agriculture and Food with a view to increasing resources allocated to the marketing of Irish produce throughout the European Union and farther afield.
• REPS III - Fine Gael calls for the immediate introduction of the REPS III Scheme. It must be designed to encourage the maximum number of farmers to participate in the scheme by ensuring an ease of entry through a minimum amount of paperwork and bureaucracy.
• New Entrants / Young Farmers – Fine Gael fully recognises the importance of passing on the family farm to the next generation. We will work with our European partners to develop policies to assist young farmers. In particular, we will regularly review the level and functioning of installation aid to ensure that it can adapt to meet the needs of young farmers.
• World Trade Talks - Fine Gael will ensure that Ireland pursues a tough negotiating stance at the World Trade Talks to guarantee that Irish farmers and producers can remain competitive and dynamic on the global market.

MARINE

Given the present geo-political climate and the possible threat of terrorist attacks, the EU, in recognising the vulnerability of maritime targets, should establish an EU Coastguard to provide a co-ordinated rapid response should such a maritime attack ever occur.

Such a coastguard could also vigorously police the revised Common Fisheries Policy to ensure the deal, which involves a significant loss of tonnage for Irish fishermen, is administered fairly.

An EU Coastguard could also have a vital role in combating the actions of organised criminals who exploit EU waters in the trafficking of arms, drugs and human beings.

EU Member States acting alone are under resourced and ill prepared to face the threat of maritime disaster. The traffic in EU shipping lanes is increasingly heavy and the number of collisions that have occurred in EU waters point to the need for more effective co-ordination if we are to avoid potential maritime disasters.

Fine Gael MEPs were instrumental in having a proposal on the establishment of an EU Coastguard accepted recently by the European Parliament Committee on Maritime Safety, and will continue to call vigorously for the establishment of such a service.

The enlarged EU will be Union of weight, of wealth and of influence. However, at this time of European change and transformation it is important that we do not allow relationships with States outside the EU to become marginalised.
• As an island nation, Ireland must become a leader in research on wave and tidal energy;

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

Pollution does not respect national boundaries. Environmental damage in one Member State affects other States around it. For this reason, Fine Gael believes that the European Union must take an increasingly active role in legislating for a cleaner environment.

Fine Gael is deeply concerned at the continued operation of the Sellafield nuclear plant and is strongly opposed to any expansion of its activities. Sellafield poses an unacceptable threat to all the people of Ireland, and particularly those on the eastern seaboard.

Fine Gael believes that the EU must be rigorous in enforcing standards on safety and security at nuclear plants including the transport of nuclear materials, storage of depleted nuclear materials, management of radioactive waste, the risk of accidents or incidents and radioactive discharges into the sea. In Ireland’s case the last issue is particularly important because of the discharges from Sellafield.

Ireland has changed immeasurably since the 1990s. However, our rapid development has not been accompanied by an emphasis on good planning. Consequently, Ireland has seen a level of environmental deterioration in recent years that must be challenged.

In terms of waste management, the prevention and minimisation of waste, and the provision of recycling facilities, requires urgent priority. Ireland lags far behind other EU Member States in the amount that we recycle. We recycle less than 8% of our household waste compared with 46% for Austria, 44% for Holland, 40% for Belgium, and 30% for Germany.

Fine Gael remains very concerned at the failure of the Government to prioritise environmental matters, and to implement key EU Directives without delay.

RENEWABLE ENERGY

Today, Ireland is the worst performer in the EU in the area of renewable energy promotion. We produce just 2% of gross electricity production from renewable energy sources, while production in Germany and Denmark averages over 20%. This has an impact upon our greenhouse gas emissions, currently running at 39% above our 1990 emissions levels, which is three times the 13% target set at Kyoto.

This Government has failed to support the development of renewable energy options, and under the Emissions Trading Directive Ireland could face fines of over €1 billion over the next ten years. Therefore, there is a compelling economic argument, as well as an environmental argument, for new and innovative policies that will massively increase Ireland’s Renewable Energy output.

As a matter of urgency, we must create a viable market place for Renewable Energy. Fine Gael believes that this can be achieved by action in key areas:
• Wind energy must be prioritised;
• Wood Biomass can be used to replace peat as a fuel source;
• Cutbacks in the forestry sector should be reversed to expand planting;
• An inter-connector to allow Ireland to become an exporter of Renewable Energy should be provided;
• Tax incentives to grow biofuels on Irish farms should be introduced;
• All local authorities must be directed to create renewable energy plans;
• A Minister for State for Energy should be appointed; and,
• The investment of €30 million, promised in the NDP to develop the National Grid to facilitate Renewable
• Energy development, must be provided.

COMMUNICATING EQUALLY

Fine Gael commits itself to the call for the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive to include provision for those with a sensory disability. We also call on the European Commission to formulate an Action Plan on TV access for people with disabilities as part of the Directive.

Fine Gael believes that captioning (subtitling) must become more widely available across all EU Member States to allow people who are deaf increased access to the pleasure and information available through television.

We also favour the enhanced provision of wireless broadband technologies, as they can be of particular assistance in increasing technological access to those in regional areas of the EU.

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Fine Gael will fight for the retention of Objective One Status for the Border-Midlands-West (BMW) region in the allocation of EU Cohesion funds post-2006.

Fine Gael will work to ensure that EU policies in key areas like Industrial Development, Trade and Enterprise are not at divergence with EU Regional Development policies. In the interests of balanced regional development, during the formation of new policies for the EU, their likely impact on the regions should be considered.

Fine Gael believes that EU Regional Development policies, such as Structural Funding, should aim not only to address economic and social imbalances between the regions, but also seek to enhance equal opportunities for men and women, and marginalized groups such as the elderly and the disabled within the regions.

TOURISM

Tourism is critical for Ireland’s economic success and stability. The tourism industry delivers up to €2.2 billion in tax receipts to the exchequer every year, employs 140,000 people, and accounts for 4.4% of Ireland’s GNP. The importance of the industry to Ireland’s economy is obvious, but under the current Government a lack of competitiveness coupled with rising costs and charges has put the future growth of the industry in jeopardy.

Throughout the EU, tourism accounts for 5% of employment and has a significant knock-on effect on other aspects of economic life. Tourism also has an important role in political, cultural and social integration within the EU.

Fine Gael believes that EU funding for tourism is critical in providing greater access to the regions, and in redressing imbalances in tourism growth when they arise. Ireland, as an island nation, faces particular difficulties with regard to access, and requires specific EU support to overcome geographical difficulties.

"EP 2004: Green Party","Introduction

This manifesto sets out to re-build confidence and hope in politics. It outlines a better future, not just for Ireland or the EU, but for the global community as well. It’s time for real change. Green politics offers that change. It is the politics Ireland has to take up on June 11th for the sake of our children’s future and for generations to come.

‘Think Globally, Act Locally’ is the motto that launched the Green Movement. The need to see the bigger picture – that vision of a better world and how it might be achieved – along with the belief that each and everyone of us can contribute to creating such a world, informs all the policies and actions of the Green Party.

It is therefore no accident that this Green Party Manifesto for the 2004 Elections encompasses our policy positions for both the European and Local Elections: it is a 21st century vision for Bantry and Brussels… for Donegal and Dublin. It is, in fact, based on the framework of the European Federation of Green Parties’ Manifesto, demonstrating that the Green Party /Comhaontas Glas is part of a much broader green movement. Not only are we members of the recently launched European Greens that crosses the countries of Europe and works to great effect in the European Union, but we are also part of a larger movement for green politics that extends across the globe.

What our Green MEPS do in the European Parliament is inextricably linked with the work of our TDs in Dáil Eireann and with our councillors at local level. Actions taken in Brussels touch every Irish city, town and village, impacting on our fishing and agriculture communities, on employment, and on how we provide housing, waste, environmental and transport services for our people.

Likewise, decisions in the Dáil and on local councils can impact directly on European and global issues.

For example, in one area alone – agriculture – the encouragement of local farmer’s markets, organics and energy crops, the maintenance of local abattoirs, the creation of GMO-Free zones, all have knock-on effects in terms of food and animal exports, food quality, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

The Green Party warmly welcomes the addition of ten new EU States and looks forward to new Green MEPs from these countries joining us in the European Parliament., where we already have 45 Green MEPs from twelve countries in the Green group. There is also a new EU Constitution under consideration which will influence the future course of the EU’s development. Issues involving the EU’s economic and environmental health, the safety and quality of our food, energy and transport systems, justice and immigration policy, the ‘war on terrorism’, Social Europe, globalisation, the EU’s military dimension - will all have to be considered by our elected MEPs.

The results from the Local Elections must produce councillors who will address our housing and planning crisis, find ways to build healthy and sustainable communities for our people, resolve our waste and transport problems, clean up our environment, and create safe play areas and ‘safe routes’ to school for our children.

Our European and Local Government candidates come from all walks of life and are embedded in their local communities. Their goal at both EU and local level will be to bring social and economic gains to all levels of society and to tackle the environmental degradation that the existing political system has disregarded and which threatens us all.

The core issue of these elections is democracy and accountability. The Green Party believes that decisionmaking should be taken at the lowest effective level, as close as possible to the people affected by those decisions.

There is a need for the European Parliament – as the most democratically accountable and open body in the EU – to be strengthened within the EU.

‘Think Globally, Act Locally’

These is a need for the EU to make a significant policy shift in its economic policies, away from corporate driven globalisation towards more localised production and democratic controls: issues such as social justice and environmental protection go hand in hand and must not take second place to the single pursuit of economic competitiveness.

The EU must also take subsidiarity more seriously and devolve more power back to States and regions. Local authorities must be given more powers, with true de-centralisation of decision-making out of Dublin, not a mere moving of offices around the State.

There is also another focus for our concerns about democracy and accountability in these elections: the Fianna Fáil/PD Government. We now have perhaps the most arrogant Government in the State’s history. This Government’s anti-democratic tendencies are breathtaking. It has single-mindedly attempted to remove the people from politics, whether it be by:

Curtailing freedom of information;

Manipulating the planning process and shielding it from public objections;

Limiting accountability and stifling debate in the Dáil;

Amending the Constitution without proper consultation or preparation;

Re-running referendums until it gets the answer it wants;

Supporting and providing facilities for an illegal war on Iraq despite widespread public opposition;

Spending scarce resources - without authorisation - on housing Punchestown horses rather than homeless people.

Attempting to undermine the democratic process itself by unilaterally introducing an unsafe and unaccountable electronic voting system.

While Fianna Fáil and the PDs have been fiddling with the public finances – the people of Ireland have had to suffer deteriorating public services, inadequate public transport, a sick health service, a growing gap between this country’s rich and poor, increased child poverty, growing homelessness and skyrocketing house prices, environmental decline, lack of assistance for the most vulnerable in society - in short, a general deterioration in Quality of Life. A vote for the Greens on the 11th of June is a vote for positive changes which will improve our quality of life.

1 Safeguarding The Environment

Environmental protection is an obvious policy area for action at EU level, as pollution does not respect national boundaries. 80% of our environmental legislation comes from the EU. The European Parliament can make a real difference to our environment – and has, thanks to Green Party inputs. It shares decision-making powers with the Council of Ministers in the environmental area and has an important ‘oversight’ role with the Commission and the Council on environmental law implementation. At a local level, Green Party councillors have a crucial role in enforcing these laws.

At EU level

Our Green MEPs have shown environmental leadership, making important improvements to EU legislation in areas such as water policy, climate change, air quality, animal welfare, GMOs, waste management and access to environmental information, amongst others. Achievements have included, for example, the strengthening of the Water Framework Directive, promoting air quality legislation, and the establishment in the Electronic Waste Directive of ‘producer responsibility’ for the ‘end of life’ treatment of electrical and electronic equipment, thus encouraging the producers of such equipment to move towards eco-design.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Push for the introduction of an EU instrument banning the use of phosphates and all phosphate detergents

Ensure Ireland’s full compliance with the EU Air Quality Directive and Press the EU Commission to legislate against car emissions that are responsible for growing health problems, including alarming rises in asthma levels.

Ensure the availability of EU funding for further research and development of ‘green’ cars, powered by biofuels, electric batteries, solar panels or hydrogen fuel cells, thereby reducing damaging emissions.

Push the EU to follow the example set by New Zealand, Western Australia, California, Toronto and elsewhere to establish a Zero Waste economy within a twenty-year period based on best practice around the world.

In Local Authorities

Green Party councillors have been proactive champions of the environment and have been acting in close contact with our Green MEPs to better environmental conditions locally. For example; cooperation between Green Party councillor and Euro-candidate Mary White and Nuala Ahern MEP facilitated a petition to the European Parliament’s Petitions Committee on the poor water quality in Co Kilkenny. This resulted in a full hearing by the EU in Kilkenny and a call by the Parliament to the Commission to require Ireland to comply with EU water directives.

Green Councillors will continue to:

Ensure waste prevention and minimisation objectives are prioritised within all County Waste Management Plans.

Promote first class recycling facilities and oppose the building of municipal waste incinerators.

Support Catchment-Based management plans and River Basin Management Systems to protect our precious water supplies and fisheries.

Campaign for the introduction of new laws to control the spreading of slurry, the use of REPS funding to provide incentives for further reductions in the use of chemical fertilisers and the introduction of harsher penalties for failure to respect buffer zones between slurry spreading and water sources.

Support the provision of financial assistance to farmers to comply with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive.

Shift in Energy Policy Climate Change

Climate change, arising from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas, presents a key challenge to global sustainable development. While the EU has taken the lead amongst industrialised nations in pushing for commitments and targets under the Kyoto protocol, scientists are now telling us we need to reduce our emissions by some 60 – 80% . Ireland is committed to limiting its greenhouse gas emissions to 13 per cent above 1990 levels, by the year 2012. Alarmingly, however, Ireland’s levels are now over twice that target and are continuing to rise.

Irish society needs to shift to clean renewable energy sources (offshore windfarms, biomass, biofuels, wave and solar power) and must promote much greater levels of energy efficiency and energy conservation.

At EU level

Our Green Party MEPs have contributed to the adoption of the first emissions trading scheme to curb greenhouse gases. They have campaigned against BNFL nuclear transports and campaigned relentlessly to have Sellafield decommissioned.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Lobby to have the Euratom Treaty reviewed and phased out.

Insist on an increase in the use of clean renewable energy sources to 25% of overall energy consumption within the EU by 2020.

Campaign for a long-term, ecologically sound, fair and equitable Climate Change Stability Pact.

Push for the integration of environmental concerns, in particular energy consumption, into the transport sector and for the inclusion of all stakeholders, including environmental NGOs, in the development of EU transport policy.

In Local Authorities

Green Party councillors have succeeded in encouraging some local authorities to conduct energy audits and to switch over to green electricity and have lobbied for greater energy conservation in new buildings.

Green Councillors will continue to:

Ensure that local government plays its part in fully implementing Ireland’s National Climate Change Strategy,

Encourage alternative energy projects through County Development Plans and the planning process

Continue to campaign against nuclear power, particularly Sellafield and to be actively involved in the Nuclear Free Local Authorities initiative,

Support alternatives to car use and improve conditions for cyclists, pedestrians and bus passengers

Implement ‘Safe Routes to Schools’ schemes for all our schools and colleges to encourage students to walk and cycle.

Ensure that all council buildings are energy efficient, that all planning permissions ensure energy efficiency and introduce an energy rating standard for new homes.

Safe Food – From Field to Fork

Intensive agricultural practices have led to EU- wide food scares and a call for better food safety standards in order to protect consumers. Meanwhile a new threat to the agriculture and wildlife is imminent though the proposed introduction of GM crops. The Green Party is concerned about the potentially irreversible effects that GM crops may have on the natural environment.

Current agricultural policies have also let the farming community down. We want to see Ireland’s farmers and producers establishing world-class products and becoming market leaders by excelling in wholesome production techniques, reducing chemical and energy inputs and rejecting GMOs throughout the island.

At EU level

Our Green Party MEPs have been very proactive in promoting food safety measures and have been key players in adopting EU legislation regarding the authorisation, traceability and labelling of GMOs and GM products. We have pushed for the internet ‘rapid alert system’ warning about food risks connected with residues in food; helped achieve a ban on feeding meat and bone meals to animals; and contributed to the decision to abolish the only four remaining antibiotics still authorised in animal feed.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Campaign for the overall levels of EU funding for rural development to be increased by at least 20%

Ensure that all GM products are labelled and that member states can take appropriate measures to prevent the unintended presence of GMOs in conventional and organic products.

Campaign to have 10% of the EU agricultural land area farmed organically by 2010.

Lobby to have food safety regulations adapted to foster and support high quality regional and local food enterprises.

Lobby for the introduction of an EU instrument to reduce the overall use of pesticides.

Promote a development budget for agri-environmental schemes, in order to establish practices that protect and improve biodiversity, habitats, landscape and animal welfare and reward farmers for adopting them.

Ensure animal welfare and the phase out of live animal exports: the Greens are the only political force with an animal rights philosophy at its core.

In Local Authorities

Green Party councillors will continue to:

Encourage measures that shorten the food chain, e.g. farmers markets, food co-ops, shorter distribution runs and local abattoirs.

Support new opportunities for landowners including locally agreed wind farms, agri- and eco-tourism; the growing of bio-fuel and energy crops and broadleaf forestry.

Conservation

The Green Party will continue to promote the protection of biodiversity, fisheries, landscapes, and our built heritage. Ireland is currently in breach of a number of the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives and has the second smallest network of Special Protected Areas (SPAs) in the EU. The Greens will continue their high profile support for conservation of fish stocks. (Patricia McKenna MEP, is Green spokesperson on Fisheries in the European Parliament). The Greens have also made great progress in the Parliament on farm animal welfare, vivisection, cosmetic testing, the hunting and shooting of migratory birds and the conservation of habitats. There is also a need for strong action to protect Ireland’s valuable stock of built heritage, which is becoming increasingly vulnerable to development pressures.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Ensure the proper implementation and enforcement of the Birds and Habitats Directives.

Ensure the monitoring of Structural Funds so that they are not used to damage important sites for nature conservation.

Ensure the effective integration of nature conservation objectives into all relevant policy areas, in particular transport, fisheries, agriculture and regional development.

Support reforms of the Common Fisheries Policy and follow through on successes in curbing Supertrawlers.

Green Councillors will continue to:

Integrate conservation issues into all relevant policy areas. Encourage tree protection and promotion.

Promote proper coastal zone management.

Lobby for the strengthening of the Heritage protection provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

Push for the amending of planning legislation to provide for the mandatory listing of public rights of way by local authorities, and ensure their listing and protection within Development Plans.

Environmental Enforcement

Irish implementation of EU environmental legislation is one of the worst in Europe. The highest number of environmental complaints to the European Commission come from Irish citizens. The complaints against Ireland cover many issues including failure to control illegal waste activities, decline in water quality, heritage sites under attack from development and lack of or poor Environmental Impact Assessments. While the Environmental Protection Agency acts as the ultimate environmental management body in Ireland, the enforcement of most environmental legislation rests with local authorities.

At EU level

Green Party MEPs have been very active in Europe at pushing for much greater enforcement of environmental legislation. We have raised complaints in the Parliament and to the Commission about Ireland’s poor water quality, illegal dumping in Wicklow, and the poor environmental planning behind proposed incinerators at Poolbeg and Ringaskiddy.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Promote strengthened EU environmental enforcement legislation.

Push for the Parliament to regularly consult environmental citizen’s organisations that act as watchdogs of the EU’s policies and practices.

Lobby for NGOs to have access to judicial review of EU institution decisions in order to defend citizen’s interests.

Actively promote the citizen’s petitions process to progress environmental enforcement.

Green Councillors will continue to:

Lobby for the recently established Office for Environmental Enforcement (OEE) to develop a regional enforcement network as a matter of priority.

Campaign for the proper implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive in Ireland.

Ensure proper enforcement of local planning laws.

Work toward meaningful public participation in all environmental decision-making.

2 Greening The Social Dimension

The Greens believe in strong communities and liveable cities. A focus of Green politics is social inclusion and efficient basic public services for all. Green social and employment policies include active efforts to further the interests of women and also to facilitate a good work and family life balance. Greens also believe that people with disabilities have the right to live a normal life where barriers to work and to facilities must be removed.

However, Ireland is one of the most unequal societies in the developed world. In terms of Gross Domestic Product per capita, Ireland sits near the top of the international league. However, we come second worst out of 17 northern industrial countries, just behind the United States, in the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Poverty Index – a measure of poverty which takes into account life expectancy, health, education, standard of living and social exclusion.

The Green Party – working in the European Parliament and in local authorities up and down the country is committed to what the German Green Party’s Joschka Fischer, has described as “A new politics of generosity”. We face long-term challenges in terms of:

Providing an infrastructure of caring;

Providing for an aging population;

Reversing the growing inequality in society;

Providing access to a whole range of public services & infrastructure that doesn’t exist at present.

Housing and Access to accommodation

Our housing crisis is now evident in three ways: unaffordable private housing, exorbitant private rents and a shortage of public housing. House prices and private rents have risen beyond the reach of many while the state has provided too few houses for those who can neither buy nor rent. Government policy over several decades has encouraged a view of housing as a good to be allocated by the market, ultimately as a means of speculation and wealth creation rather than as a shelter and a home. New house prices have increased over three

times faster than house building costs and six times faster than the consumer price index since 1994. There is evidence of a monopoly-type situation, where supernormal profits are being made by developers and landowners.

Health

As we emerge from a period of unprecedented prosperity in this country, our health services have never looked as under-resourced, or as vulnerable. In contrast with the centralisation of health services proposed within the Hanly report, we support accountable and efficient health services at local, regional and national levels.

We favour the Department of Health remaining as a ‘Health Executive’ and, at a local level, we wish to see leaner and restructured health boards with formal representation for patient/consumer groups. The Greens will introduce 24 hour, ‘one-stop shop’ community health clinics staffed by multi-disciplinary teams which will significantly alleviate the current pressures on Accident and Emergency departments of acute hospitals. We favour an integrated model of health care that incorporates preventative and complementary medicine into traditional healthcare structures.

“A new politics of generosity”

Transport

Ireland is becoming the most car dependent country in the world. The Green Party’s policy on transport contains a comprehensive package of measures aimed at shifting Ireland’s transport focus from unsustainable road building to the provision of quality public transport and cycling facilities. Our policy is aimed at: reducing traffic deaths and injuries; improving accessibility; reducing our national fuel bill, reducing pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, and improving the quality of life in our streets, towns, and rural areas.

Green jobs for the future

The economic growth and jobs of the future will come from the new clean technologies which will also solve some of our environmental problems. The Green Party wants to help develop a thriving enterprise culture.To achieve this we would lower labour taxes and instead, raise the revenue from environmental taxes, such as the proposed carbon tax, which will also help clean up our act.

Green spaces and play areas

In the consultation leading to the development of a National Play Strategy for Ireland, over 2000 children wrote to the Minister for Children, identifying play and recreation as a major quality of life issue for them. Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises “the right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities.” Yet, many children live in communities with minimum or no play and recreational facilities.

Anti Social Behaviour

Ireland incarcerates the highest proportion of 18-25 year old offenders in Europe. The Green Party will press for a radical overhaul of our youth justice system and press for a comprehensive range of measures to address anti-social behaviour. Our educational system, the planning of our housing estates, support for community and family structures, tackling social disadvantage, even the materialistic ethos of the Celtic Tiger must be addressed as part of any considered response to this deterioration in our communities.

Life long Education and The Arts

The link between education and life chances has long been recognised but as we move to a knowledge-based economy this link becomes even more important.

Our society and economy will pay dearly for any failure to combat educational disadvantage. We believe that attempts to mitigate educational disadvantage need to begin even before a child starts school. For the Green Party accessibility to the Arts is an essential part of education and a meaningful life.

Social cohesion and inclusion

The Green Party believes that Ireland can only benefit from a true gender balance in all aspects of life. We also believe that equality must mean increasing life choices for all citizens, enabling women and men to pursue lives characterised by fulfilment and a healthy balance between work and other life choices, including family life.

Older Citizens

If we are to cherish our senior citizens we must spend more money on services (not just health services) to the elderly, without cutting back on money for individuals and institutions. For example, introducing real public transport options for people in rural areas, particularly the elderly, and giving significantly more money to carers, and easing the criteria for eligibility.

At EU level

The Greens have highlighted the need for strong EU social policies to be guaranteed in the new EU Constitution; insisted that full employment, environmental criteria, and quality jobs be added, alongside competitiveness, as EU goals for achievement by 2010. We have campaigned to ensure that women’s

rights and equality issues are fully integrated into the Parliament’s work and have issued a major report showing how transport policies, which promote walking and cycling, can also bring major benefits in health policy.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Monitor and promote the above policy areas and:

Highlight new environmentally friendly technologies as the way forward for the EU Member States economic development;

Ensure the EU institutions take environmental and social criteria into account when making public procurement decisions;

Promote ecological and social auditing of the EU budget.

In Local Authorities

Green Councillors will continue to :

Amend Development Plans to protect public open/green spaces and ensure we have at least as many playgrounds as golf courses

Ensure development plans and planning permissions use best practice in terms of promoting sustainable, properly facilitated developments, including the designation of lands alongside new housing developments for primary and post primary schools

Resist the privatisation of public amenities

Secure new school facilities which should be designed to have multiple uses for the community

Campaign to reverse the decline in the provision of social housing

Promote a series of reforms in the provision of land for housing, including a reformed development levy mechanism to recoup a fair share of the value added to urban and rural land that is zoned for development, and ensuring local authorities can compulsorily purchase development land prior to rezoning at agricultural or existing use value plus 25%.

Promote a proper National Spatial Strategy, and help to maintain and increase population numbers in rural areas through the creation of new villages or village clusters as a means of actively preventing further dispersal of settlement

Bring the Barcelona Declaration home, to ensure that local councils protect the rights of people with disabilities

Provide first class ‘one stop shop’ local community health centres to take the pressure off A&E departments in major hospitals. These will provide 24 hour cover and be staffed by multi-disciplinary teams

Call for priority spending on new public transport provision including:

A metro system for Dublin (Sandyford to Swords);

A rail inter-connector for Dublin, linking the rail terminals at Spencer Docks and Heuston Station;

A rail link to Shannon;

Western Rail Corridor (initially from Ennis and Tuam to Galway);

A suburban rail network for Cork serving Middleton and Youghal etc;

Connecting the two existing Luas Lines in Dublin and starting to build more;

Enhanced support for urban and rural bus services.

3 Developing Democracy

The Greens believe in the European community, not in a European Superstate. We want a Europe where decisions are made by elected parliamentarians and not behind closed doors. We don’t want decisions being made which go completely against the will of the people, e.g. the introduction of GM crops. We want a social Europe, which protects workers, public services and minorities. We want a commonsense Europe that works for the interests of all.

Our Green MEPs have already made contributions to safeguarding human rights and increasing accountability and transparency in the EU. Their interventions have ensured – and will continue to ensure that:

The public can directly influence EU decisions.

The Green Party have strongly supported and assisted citizens’ petitions and complaints to the EU, particularly on Ireland’s failure to comply with EU environmental directives.

EU institutions and EU decision-making are more accountable to the people. For example, the Greens have led the political demands for more democratic scrutiny, by both the EU and national parliaments, of EU cooperation on policing and justice issues.

Expanded protection is given to immigrants and refugees, and human rights and anti-discrimination positions are strongly upheld. Because of the Greens, immigrants who have resided more than five years in the EU now have the same rights and freedoms as citizens of the Union. Green MEPs continue to monitor the EU’s observance of international human rights agreements, particularly in terms of asylum seekers.

Stronger personal data protection and stronger controls on surveillance systems are needed.

The Greens will monitor the implementation of the Declaration on Combating Terrorism passed at the 2004 EU March summit, under the Irish Presidency, to ensure that the major surveillance systems put in place do not jeopardise basic democratic freedoms such as freedom of movement and expression and the right to privacy.

Green MEPs will also continue to highlight the need to redress the EU’s democratic deficit. The provision in the new draft Constitution for more shared co-decision powers between the European Parliament and the Council is welcome. However, overall the Constitution has failed to redress the democratic deficit. The Greens will also continue to push for any eventual Constitution to be put for approval before the people in the member states via a Europe-wide referendum on the same day.

Local Government

Ireland is one of the most centralised democratic states in Europe. Not only do local authorities need more power, but so do our people, via better accountability and more involvement.

To strengthen and democratise local government, the Greens will act at both national and local level to:

Introduce directly elected mayors.

Dismantle Local Government legislation removing powers from local councillors and transfer back decisionmaking powers from city/county managers to elected public representatives.

Introduce Local Government Ombudsman/Local Public Accounts Committees to stop the planning scandals of recent years.

Lower the voting age to 16 for local government elections.

Ensure that local authorities fully develop partnerships with local community groups.

Increase funding/ support and provision of facilities to the Strategic Policy Committees.

Ensure environmental representation and increased community/voluntary inputs to County Development Boards.

Introduce a Local Sustainability Bill to empower local communities.

Increase public involvement/consultation in local decision-making by changing the timing and structure of council meetings and arranging for the holding of meetings in local community venues.

Continue to use new Information and Communications technologies to develop and run web-based petitions on council issues.

Promote ‘Local Democracy Week’, with ‘travelling town halls’ to local communities, Council meetings held in local schools, and encouragement of young people’s involvement in the political process.

4 Strengthening Peace

At EU level

The greatest achievement of the EU has been the creation of structures for the development of peaceful, mutually beneficial relations between states. Out of a bitter and deadly legacy of two world wars and, most recently, a Cold War, former enemies have come together as partners. The accession of ten new member states is a major achievement in reconciliation and in healing a divided Continent.

The Green Party is therefore very concerned at the EU’s current militarisation. The concentration on military approaches to security issues as represented by the development of a Rapid Reaction Force, EU military command structures, and an armaments agency, are to be regretted and opposed. The proposed EU Constitution continues this trend and moves the EU closer to a military alliance, complete with ‘solidarity’ and mutual defence clauses.

Ireland’s long-standing neutrality policy and UN peacekeeping role has been steadily eroded, not just by military developments in the EU but by the Irish Government’s provision of Shannon Airport to the United States’ illegal war against Iraq. These are developments the Green Party will continue to oppose, while working for the strengthening of the United Nations.

Green MEPs have been active peacemakers in the European Parliament. It was the Greens who first proposed an International War Crime Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, a concept later used to establish the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The Greens were the first, in 2000, to ask for a war crime tribunal to judge Saddam Hussein’s regime.

The Greens have also been active on global conflict issues -- Chechnya, the Middle East, Tibet, Indonesia and Africa – and have ensured proper engagement of the EU with the UN Commission on Human Rights.

The Greens continue to work for nuclear disarmament and arms control, and, in relation to depleted uranium and cluster bombs, have convinced the European

Parliament to adopt a resolution calling for a moratorium on these weapons.

In terms of the Iraq war, due in part to Green amendments, the European Parliament adopted a clear position against the war on January 30, 2003, expressing its opposition to any unilateral military action and preemptive strikes.

Another Green initiative resulted in most of the European Parliament signing a petition against the Iraq war. Following this initiative, an EP delegation which included Patricia McKenna MEP, travelled to Baghdad and Washington to present the petition to UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.

Green MEPs will:

Fully support an EU ‘peace strengthening’ role that is centred on mediation, diplomacy and early conflict resolution, cultural appreciation, fair trade and fair control of energy resources.

Support the establishment of a civilian EU Peace Corps, working in close liaison with the UN.

Promote the role of neutrals within the EU and oppose EU militarisation.

Support the strengthening of the EU’s Code of Conduct for arms exports, due for review the end of 2004.

Lobby for the retention and increased funding to EU programmes aimed at peace and reconciliation.

In Local Authorities

Public representatives at local level can also strengthen the peace process, whether it be by promoting cross-border cooperation, the twinning of cities, the establishment of nuclear-free-zones, or public awareness campaigns/cultural activities.

5 Promoting Grassroots Globalisation

The Greens insist that ecological and social criteria must be taken into account in world trade talks. The trade policies adopted by the European Union have often had negative consequences for the poorest countries in the world. The worldwide protests against these sort of policies are part of the global movement which is saying that their is a better way for us to use and share the planets resources.

The Greens are also deeply concerned by the over reliance on market forces. This is evident in the EU’s competition policy, its monetary policy, and in the fiscal discipline that goes with the Stability and Growth Pact as large business institutions continue to dictate policy. Far from protecting the European Social Model from the worst forms of globalisation, the EU is undermining this through economic deregulation; and the narrowing and reduction of the tax base, resulting in poor public services.

Boston versus Berlin?

As Europeans we have a relatively healthy trust in the organisational and steering capacities of state enterprise, while not ruling out the potential of private enterprise to provide other services and goods. We maintain a preference for the welfare state’s guarantees of social security and social inclusion. We can seek to defend, develop and indeed globalise our distinctive European model of governance or we can surrender to the disciplines of a globalisation that thrives on competition and threatens to reduce all decisions on people and the planet to the anonymous calculus of the market place.

Green MEPs will continue to:

Protect Public services – we are challenging the corporate drive to privatise services, including education, health and water supplies.

Reform our trade policies to make sure we are not destroying the farming communities and fledging industries in the poorest countries in the world.

Resist the patenting of life - Rules must be re-written to prohibit patents and monopoly control on all life forms.

Ensure that within its five interrelated components environmental protection, social justice, employment, economy and culture, sustainability must be the leading principle of multilateral political negotiations and decisions.

Promote diversity – As well as biodiversity, cultural and linguistic diversity must be preserved, e.g. promotion of public service broadcasting

Promote the transfer of trade dispute settlements, including the dispute mechanism at the WTO, to an independent or UN-supervised body, where complaints can be filed by concerned citizens and communities.

Ensure that trade negotiations do not result in a new colonisation of Africa and South America.

In Local Authorities

Our Councillors will continue to support such initiatives as local markets and Fair Trade policies in local councils; will work with local fishing communities and the EU to protect fish stocks, jobs and fishing ports and will block the privatisation of council-run amenities; and promote the social economy

"EP 2004: Labour","The European elections on 11th June will be historic. For the first lime, people frOll1 10 new Member Stales will take part in European elections across 25 counlrics. Members of the new European Parliament will serve the interests of 450 million citizens and must ensure that Europe answers 10 their needs and priorities.

Labour, together with her sister parties in the Party of European Socialists (PES), h: urging voters to seize the opportunity of these elections to shape the Europe:HI Union's future. Problems and challenges common to all European countries, such as the environment, migration and cross border crime and terrorism, are best tackled by European solutions. Decisions on European law and spending made by MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg might seem far from home, but they directly affect the working and living conditions of each and every one of us.

Labour's MEPs will be members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliarucllt, striving to build a European Union that combines social justice within countries ;)11(1 solidarity between countries. This manifesto strongly reflects the shared priorities of the Party of European Socialists, and the agenda to which Labour MEPs will contribute in the next European Parliament. A vole for Labour in the Europe;HI Elections is a vote for a strong, social EU that provides economic success and security for its people: a Union that is able 10 tackle the major challenges of unemployment, social justice, third world poverty, international terrorism and the global environment.

The election on the 11 th June is also an opportunity 10 express your disgust at a Government which blatantly lied to the Irish people at the last election, and which consistently places special interests above the concerns of the people who elected them. These elections are an opportunity to send a message to this arrogant and deceitful FF/PD Government that its days are numbered.

Labour is fielding candidates of the finest calibre, who will be diligent, accessiblc and committed MEPs, determined to make a real difference in Europe. So, don't just make a protest, make a difference. Vote Labour on 11 th June.

Across Europe, social democrats of every country are contesting these elections on a platform which advocates a successful and united European Union that is an area of peace, prosperity and cooperation based on partnership and the rule of law. We also recognise that in many policy areas nalional or local authorities arc in a belief position 10 act. labour MEPs will work with the Party of European Socialists to build a progressive European Union that puts the concerns of people firs!. We want to ensure that all citizens, in both the existing and the new Member States, benefit from EU enlargement.

In common with our European colleagues, our platform for this election is built around five key commitments for the European Parliament's next five-year term:

Labour is committed to,

• A Prosperous and Fair European Economy, with More and Better Jobs
• Bringing the European Union closer to its citizens
• A Humane Migration Policy
• Building a more secure, peaceful and just world
• Promoting Europe as an area of democracy and equality

Some Key Policy Priorities ...

• A European Constitution which makes the Union more democratic, more socially inclUSive, more effective and that brings it closer to its citizens.
• EU legislation 10 make paid parental leave for both men and women a right for all workers.
• Reform the Stability and Growth Pact and develop a European monetary policy that promotes growth, sustainable development and employment.
• Support European legislation on employment rights.
• Develop a European immigration and asylum policy.
• Use the European Social Fund to set up integration policies that include better education for migrants and community involvement.
• Equal treatment for people with disabilities and a disability specific directive.
• Ensure that the fight against poverty and social exclusion is included in all EU policies, that targets arc set for poverty reduction and that a Green paper is produced on illiteracy and social exclusion.
• Campaign for a European Law to protect public services.
• Improve access to information technology and aim to provide broadband internet access for all citizens by 2012.
• Strengthen accountable European police cooperation through Europol to step up the fight against cross-border crime, drug trafficking and money laundering.
• Support a Europe-wide ban on television advertising directed at children, and an EU action plan on television access for people with disabilities.
• Support the United Nations Millennium Goals.
• Use EU influence to resume and complete world trade talks to promote global fair trade.
• Increase spending on EU Development Aid, including Debt Cancellation, appoint a Commissioner with responsibility for Development and ensure that development policies respect the environment.
• Support negotiation of an International Arms Trade Treaty.
• Strengthen the role of the European Parliament as the democratic voice of the European people.

In a globalised world, living standards for all European citizens will depend on a competitive European economy combined with a high standard of public services and social protection. We need more and beller jobs, full employment and social inclusion, as well as envirollmental protection and sustainable development.

Social democrats drew up the first EU action plan for economic and social reform, adopted in its Lisbon Strategy four years ago, and developed in Gothenburg, to make Europe the most dynamic knowledge· based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion by 2010.

Now we want to give fresh impetus to this strategy. The PES work programme. Momentum for recovery in Europe promoting public and private investments, proposes a detailed strategy to create more new high-quality jobs by promoting greater investment in research and technology, supporting new growth sectors and reinforcing modern education, training and lifelong learning.

We reject the allempts of right-wing governments to limit the Lisbon process to economic reforms by neglecting its social objectives. We demand action to meet the social and employment objectives of the Lisbon strategy, with particular emphasis on reaching the 70 per cent overall employment rale and the 60 per cent interim rale for women's participation in the workforce by 2010. Higher participation rales will also help Europe to tackle demographic challenges arising from an ageing population. 

We must preserve, strengthen and modernise the European Social Model which combines economic growth and adequate levels of social protection. To ensure prosperity is shared, we must strengthen social partnership at both national and European level. The convergence of economic performance must be matched by convergence of social standards to ensure that social dumping does not undermine fair competition. Our vision of the European Union is of a community based on the principles of the social market economy and mutual cooperation for the benefit of all.

European Socialists have already foughl for and secured European laws to promote greater equality between women and men at work. However, there remain inequalities in income and opportunity. Progress is still needed to ensure that equality laws are respected in practice and that there is sufficient support for working parents. This is an area where Ireland already falls lar behind other EU countries.

Building upon the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty, which paved the way for concerled action at European level against social exclusion and the new Draft Constitution which proposes 10 make combating povel1y a core European Union objective, Labour will work 10 ensure thal the fight against social exclusion and poverty is fully reflected in all Union policies and programmes. We suppOr1 the establishment of European, national and regional targets for the reduction of poverty and social exdusion and will work 10 strengthen the National Action Plans on Indusion based on dear European guidelines and recommendations and to achieve greater synergy between the Socialtnclusion Strategy and the European Employment Strategy. We are committed to improving the involvement of relevant NGO's in all European actions against social exclusion. labour will urge the Commission to come forward with a Green Paper on illiteracy and social exclusion.

Labour supports the incorporation of Ihe social dimension in all EU policies, but particularly in internal market, competition policy and public procurement laws. We demand that the Irish Government fully implement all outstanding EU social legislation, parlicularly the 2000 Working Time Directive which extends the protection offered by safe and sane EU working time laws to transport workers (due since August 2003) and to junior doctors (from August 2004). Wc support the adoption of the draft Temporary Agency Workers Directive. as endorsed by the European Parliament in November 2002. and sharply crilicise the Government for blocking this measure, which would benefit up to 90,000 Irish workers and for rd using to priorilise ilS adoption during the Irish Presidency.

During the course of the next Parliament, we will urge the Commission to come fOlward with the following legislative proposals: on social protection for new forms of employment; on paid paremalleave for both men and women: on combating bullying al work, on individual dismissals: and on updating the European Works Council Directive with the aim of improving the provisions on and the timing of information and consultation in order to ensure that they can be effective and can exert influence in restructuring processes.

We will continue to press for Ihe Commission to come forward with proposals for a Gender Equality Directive. We support the rapid implementation of the next round of the DAPHNE programme, which seeks 10 combat all forms of violence against women, children and young people, and will work 10 substantially increase the budget of this programme over the course of the next Parliament. We will work to update the 1992 Directive on pregnant workers and workers \vho have recently given birth or are brcastfccding, particularly concerning the duration of maternity leave.

We will urge the Commission 10 come fOl""\vard wilh a draft Directive aiming at equal treatment for people with disabilities. a Disability Specific Directive, and with draft European criteria for the recognition of disabilities. We support the adoption of a unified EU position in favour of the proposed United Nations legally· binding instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity 01persons with disabilities and we support the right of the Commission to take part. on the EU's behalf, in the negotiations on such an instrument. We will work for the rapid adoption of the for1hcoming draft Regulation on the rights of passengers with reduced mobility when travelling by air.

Labour supports the rapid adoption of the pos\·2006 EU 'Youth' programme. due to be proposed by the Commission later this year.

The historic EU enlargement of May 2004, welcoming ten new countries will provide a beUef standard and quality of life for citizens in the new Member Stale, stimulate trade and increase jobs across the whole of the EU. We arc committed to working towards a more efficient and effective use of the EU budget. Finances should be raised in a fair way between EU countries and citizens on the principle of solidarity between richer and poorer regions. European funds must be sufficient 10 suppon the EU's objectives, in particular 10 ensure enlargement is successful.

We arc in favour of reforming the Stability and Growlh Pact 10 promote higher growth and employment. Stability should be pursued as a vital condition for growth, not as an alternative 10 growth. Labour favours a reformed accountable European Central Bank. which combines the benefits of Central Bank independence in the execution of policy with democratic accountability for the goals and objectives of that policy.

We demand the reform of the European agricultural policy to support rural development in place of the direct subsidy of agricultural products. It is cruciallhal the reformed agricultural policy promotes high quality and affordable food and respects the environment, landscape and animal welfare.

Labour is committed to the protection of public services and will continue to urge the Commission to come forward with a Framework Directive on Public Services (i.e. Services of a General Interest) in order to give legally-binding expression to the social principles and objectives underlying public services. Labour will work to prioritise social inclusion in future EU Structural Fund programmes, including by retaining and expanding the URBAN, EQUAL, LEADER AND INTERREG Community Initiatives.

Labour's objectives :

• EU legislation to make paid parental leave for both men and women a right for all workers.
• Target EU funds on job creation.
• Strengthen the European Social Model and defend worker's rights.
• Reform the Stability and Growth Pact and develop a European monetary policy that promotes growth. sustainable development and employment in a social market economy.
• Ensure affordable, accessible and high·quality public services.
• Remove the barriers that prevent women from taking up jobs.
• Equal treatment for people with disabilities and a disability specific directive.
• Ensure that the fight against poverty and social exclusion is included in all EU policies and that targets are set for poverty reduction.
• Prioritise balanced regional development.
• Demand a Green paper on illiteracy and social exclusion.
• Campaign for a framework directive on public services.

Labour is strongly committed to a positive Irish engagement in Europe. We see a strong European Union as the primary avenue through which social democrats can confront the newly emergent forces of globalisation, and advance a progressive global agenda. As the Nice referenda demonstrated, however, Ireland's relationship with Europe has matured and grown. Quite properly, the Irish people will no unquestioningly accept what comes from Europe, but we also recognise our responsibilities. Ireland's contribution 10 the future development of the Union must be based on a sustained and robust engagement between the Irish people, the Irish Government, Irish MEPs and the Institutions of the EU itself.

The European Union must ensure not only that citizens benefit from its actions but also Ihatthey are involved in its decisions. AI the same time, in line with the subsidiarity principle, the EU should not act when national or regional bodies are better placed to do so. The Union must also ensure that its business is conducted in an efficient, effective and democratic manner if it is to sustain public confidence.

During the negotiations of the Convention on the Future of Europe, European Socialists, including Labour's Proinsias De Rossa, played a central role in shaping the draft Constitution and ensured that it included our key v;Jlues, objectives and rights. When finalised and ratified, the European Constitution must make the EU institutions more transparent, accountable and relevant to citizens. It must enable decisions to be more democratic and efficient. It must also help the European Union to speak with a clear and strong voice on the world stage. A Constitution is crucial to the success of an enlarged EU. Its adoption should, therefore, be a priority for European governments. Those Governments must not be allowed to undo the work of the Convention by producing a Constitutional Treaty which is at variance with these principles.

Labour is in principal in favour of a European Constitution and we are broadly supportive of the text brought forward by the 200 European and national Parliamentarians who prepared it. We must, however, await the final text to be produced by the Governments in June before endorsing it definitively.

Labour believes that changes to the European institutions are necessary in the interests of a more democratic, accountable and effective EU. Labour does not accept, however, that it is necessary to depan from having a Commissioner for each member state for the foreseeable future. Let us first see how a 25 member Commission can wori<., before deciding on the question of whether to reduce it or not. We will oppose any a1temptto diminish the role of the parliament in international trade negotiations or in approving Europe's budget. We favour the extension of Qualified Majority Voting in a number of areas, since this wiU limit the capacity of individual Governments to block progressive legislation. The precise formula for QMV is a pragmatiC issue, but we believe it imponant to retain national vetoes in a number of areas including cerlain aspects of taxation. defence and foreign policy.

Labour agrees with the proposal to formalise the European Council (Heads of State) and to replace the current 6 monthly Presidency rotation with an elected Chair without Executive functions. We also accept the argument for having an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs. This will not, however, affect the requirement for unanimity in cenain aspects of this sphere of policy. We suppon provisions enabling member states to maintain a policy of military neutrality if they so desire. While the Euratom Treaty is not pan of the draft treaty, Labour believes that a 'sunset"" clause should be inserted into the Euratom Treaty setling a final date for a renegotiation of this to move away from a sole support for nuclear energy 10 include the promotion of alternative safe and sustainable energy sources. We strongly support the success in incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a legally binding part of the proposed Constitution.

In a European Union for citizens, the Parly of European Socialists will suppon policies to improve people's quality of life, focusing on equal rights for women and men, rights of employees and consumers, freedom of movement, safe food,  quality of the environment and access to transport.

Fighting cross border crime requires a common approach al European level. For this reason, we will work for greater European cooperation to make society free and safe fOf everyone. The new threat of international terrorism has proved its brutal cruelty on European soil. It threatens the fundamental European values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We, as Europeans, must unite against any intimidation of this sort. No country is immune and therefore we need a truly effective co-operation between European police and security agencies to tackle and reduce this threat. In our response, however, we must defend human rights, due process and the rule of law,

European Union policies must provide for future generations by taking on board the priorities of young Europeans in education, information technology, environment and cultural diversity. We must build upon the success of the EU's youth and education programmes. We give priority to improving the conditions for young people in employment, social integration, social protection and other policy areas. We support a Europe-wide ban on advertising aimed at children. We also favour European action on television access for people with disabilities. including targets on subtitling.

Labour's Objectives,

• A European Constitution which makes the EU more effective and Ihat brings it closer to ils citizens. 
• Include a sunset clause in the Euratom Treaty setting a final date for negotiating a treaty which supports the development of sustainable energy sources.
• Give the highest priority to the fight againsttcrrorism by tackling the alienation at its roots and ensuring effective coordination of the judiciary, police and intelligence agencies, while maintaining human rights. due process and the rule of law.
• Improve access 10 information technology and aim to provide broadband internet access for all citizens by 2012.
• Strengthen accountable European police cooperation through Europol to step up the fight against cross-border crime, drug trafficking and money laundering.
• Campaign for an EU action plan on television access for people with disabilities, including measurement of levels of subtitling and associated targets.
• Support an EU·wide ban on television advertising directed at children.

Inward migration poses a new challenge 10 EU member stales which demands a Europe-wide response. Effective action in this area will only be possible if European Countries act together.

European socialists want active, firm and just management of migration and integration, while rejecting a 'Fortress Europe'. We recognise the positive contribution of legal migrants and support a mul(icullural and tolerant society. At the same time, we must tackle illegal immigration and crack down on human trafficking and exploitation.

We vehemently oppose racism and xenophobia wherever it is found. We oppose attempts by right-wing forces to exploit the issue of immigration 10, create divisions in our society, and undermine the diversity and stability of Europe. We reject any cooperation with extreme right-wing movements and parties.

Labour believes that the decision by Fianna F·il and the PDs to hold a referendum on Citizenship in the context of the local and European elections is a cynical attempt to play on racial fears. It marks a new low in Irish political life, and should be rejected by the electorate.

There is an urgent need to put in place a Common Migration Policy for the whole of the European Union which respects the desire of many from outside the European Union to make a contribution to our society while making a beller life for themselves and their families. Such a policy would also serve the need in Ireland as in the rest of Europe for migrant workers. We will insist that such workers are fully informed of their legal rights which will ensure that they are not exploited to the disadvantage of Irish citizens. As well as more effectively tackling illegal immigration. this EU-wide approach to migration would have two key features. Firstly, we will pursue an active policy of social inclusion and integration. Member States, in partnership with local authorities, must ensure that migrants can exercise all their civic and social rights, and that there is a shared management of migration flows.

Secondly, in partnership with progressive forces in other countries, we will promote a global development policy that promotes a better life in the countries of origin of migration. Fostering economic and social development in those countries and improving their humanitarian conditions must be central to European migration policy, Europe must continue to be a place of refuge for victims of persecution. It must offer full protection to asylum seekers. while co·operating to eliminate false claims to asylum by economic migrants.

Labour's Objectives:

• Develop a European immigration and asylum policy with common standards on visa rules and asylum status.
• Use the European Social Fund to set up integration policies that include better education for migrants and community involvement.
• Fight racism and xenophobia across the EU.
• Improve the standard of living in countries of origin of migration through international organisations and cooperation agreements and fair trade.

Labour wants a strong European Union that has a clear voice in international forums, pressing for a jus!. stable and peaceful world in accordance with international law in the framework of the United Nations.

As a militarily neutral country, we need reform of the United Nations 10 enhance its role in ensuring global peace and common security and 10 make it more representative. It would, for instance, make sense for the EU to have a seal at the Security Council. The European Union must pay a leading role in working for effective multilateralism, rejecting the present dangerous unilateralism of the United States, and enabling countries 10 work better together to resolve conflicts and to respond [0 new security threats. The fight against international terrorism will succeed only if we tackle the causes of terrorism. The United Nalions alone should have the authority to mandate peace keeping and conflict containment operations.

We should further develop the European Securily and Defence Policy to become a credible instrument in terms of conflict prevenlion and crisis management. We support the European Security Strategy adopted by the Council in 2003 which above all else promotes pre·emptive engagement to prevent conflicts and which will provide the framework for a more effective Common Foreign and Security Policy. We are committed to strengthening stability in South East Europe and to encouraging the European orientation of the countries of the former Yugoslavia. We must develop our partnerships with our neighbours in the Northern Dimension and revitalise the Barcelona process for our partners from the Mediterranean basin while the values of human rights and democracy need to be supported in the countries beyond our new eastern borders.

We support the rapid adoption of the draft Regulation banning trade in certain equipment and products which could be used for capital punishment or torture. We will also seek a revision of the January 2003 Council Regulation which abolished duty on certain weapons impons ill view of the Commission's acknowledgement that there are products covered by it which also would come under the draft Regulation banning trade in certain equipment and products which could be used for capital punishment or torture. We will work 10 ensure adequate EU funding for the rehabilitation of torture survivors. We believe that the EU should support an International Arms Trade Treaty. and in particular aim to stop the proliferation of small arms.

In cooperation with other progressive forces in the world. the PES has proposed new poliCies to meet global challenges. in particular the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. These policies include trade with fair access to our markets for developing countries. particularly for agricultural products, aid for social development especially health and education. higher social standards and greater emphasis on sustainable development. We will step up efforts to fight global poverty and cancel the debt of developing countries. We will also intensify the global fight against AIDS and other diseases related to poverty by promoting access 10 affordable methods of prevention and drugs for treatment. To achieve these objectives, we must ensure that they are fully shared by intemational organisations. such as the World Trade Organisation. the World Bank and Ihe International Monetary Fund. We favour the appointment of a Commissioner with specific responsibility for Development. and a more co·ordinated approach 10 EU development policy.

labour will work for the amendment of the commitment on debt entered into by EU Govemment leaders at the Barcelona Summit by including a human development approach 10 debt sustainability. We support the provision of additional EU funds (or Ihe International labour Organisations international programme on the elimination of child labour.

We will push for a progressive globalisation, which nol only increases trade with developing countries. but also promotes democracy. human rights and environmental protection in these countries. The EU must play its pan in ensuring good corporate governance and social responsibility of business wherever it trades.

We must deliver the commitments made in Kyoto IQ reduce greenhouse gas emissions and then 10 develop more ambitious targets for climate stability. To promote global sustainability, we will encourage substituting more sustainable alternatives [0 the excessive use of natural resources, especially fossil fuels.

Labour's Objectives

• Strengthen the UN and its institutions and improve cooperation.
• Enhance European Security and Defence Policy in its foie in conflict prevention and crisis management.
• Support the United Nations Millennium Goals.
• Use EU influence to resume and complete world trade talks to promote global fair trade.
• End quotas and tariffs on exports from developing countries and reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
• Ensure that our development policies respect the priority of protecting and sust<Jining the environment.
• Increase spending on EU Development Aid.
• Appoint a Commissioner with responsibility for Development.
• Build on existing efforts in the area of environment and social responsibility of global business.
• Support a ban on trade in certain equipment and products which can be used for capital punishment and torture.
• Support an International Arms Trade Treaty.

Our vision is of a European Union based on democracy. equality. respect for human rights, diversity and the rule of law. For this reason, we support the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its inclusion in the Constitutions. We should also support these values beyond the borders. 

We support a strengthened role for the European parliament as the directly elected voice of the European people. For social democrats. Equality is one of our most important values: democracy is not possible without equality. We oppose all forms of discrimination. including any based on race, religion. Belief, gender. Disability, family or marital status, age or sexual orientation.

Fraud and corruption undermine democracy and we will root them out wherever they are found. We strongly support the Draft Constitution's drive for further reform of the EU's institutions to tackle the democratic deficit. We will fight for openness and transparency, particularly in respect of the Council and the Commission. Insisting on sound financial management, and value for money in projects funded by the Union.

Labour's Objectives

• Strengthen the role of the European Parliament as the democratic voice of the European people. 
• Promote openness and accountability. particularly at European Council meetings
• Promote equality and fight all forms of discrimination,
• Reinforce alliances against extreme right-wing forces and challenge other parties, in particular those belonging to the conservative European People's Party, to sign the EU Charter for a Non·Racist Society, already signed by all European Social Democrat parties
• increase the size and effectiveness of the European Anti-Fraud Office to ensure that it acts earlier on cases of concern.

A MESSAGE FROM SINN FÉIN PRESIDENT GERRY ADAMS

As we prepare to elect our representatives to a new European Union Parliament on the 10th and 11th of June 2004 the people of Ireland are at a crossroads.

We are at a critical point in the Irish peace process. If we are to move forward, supporters of the Good Friday Agreement throughout the 32 Counties must use their vote to re-affirm their commitment to the principle set out in the Agreement, that only real change and equality can bring a lasting peace.

This election is also a key moment that will help to determine the future of the EU – and therefore Ireland’s future – for many years to come. Shortly after the election the EU heads of state will again attempt to agree a new treaty establishing for the first time an EU Constitution. This new treaty will subsequently be put to the member states for ratification, including a referendum in the 26 Counties and the first ever EU referendum in the Six Counties. The 10th and 11th of June elections will therefore also be the first opportunity for voters to send a message about whether they are satisfied with the Draft EU Constitution and, if not, what kind of EU they want to be a part of.

Sinn Féin stand for change in the EU. We have a vision for an EU that respects the democratic rights of the people of each member state. We want an EU that promotes equality among people and nations. An EU that works for the just and peaceful resolution of conflicts in Europe and beyond. We believe that the enlarged EU must adopt a new set of priorities including the elimination of poverty within its borders and the reform and strengthening of the United Nations to advance justice and peace in the wider world. The changes we want to see happen at EU level are no different from those we are pursuing here in Ireland.

We also want the EU to become a partnership of equal states. We oppose current attempts to turn the EU into a superstate or a military and economic superpower because we value Irish sovereignty and Irish neutrality. We know that the EU with all its present shortcomings was not inevitable, but reflects the political agenda of the most powerful in the EU at present – the big States, the unelected Eurocracy, and big business. It also reflects a lack of political will to change it. But it can be changed, and it should be changed.

We know that we are not alone, and we will work cooperatively with all progressive forces in Europe and beyond that share our vision.

Sinn Féin is the only all-Ireland party standing candidates in all five constituencies on the island with the ability to win seats on both sides of the border. By electing Sinn Féin representatives, the people of Ireland can have truly national representation in the EU Parliament for the first time.

An all-Ireland team of Sinn Féin MEPs can provide the effective, accountable representation that the Irish people deserve, and we give our commitment to work tirelessly for an Ireland of Equals in a Europe of Equals.

With your support, we look forward to bringing our Agenda for Change to the European stage.

AN IRELAND OF EQUALS IN A EUROPE OF EQUALS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - SINN FÉIN EU ELECTION MANIFESTO 2004 

The 2004 European Parliament elections are FOR AN EU THAT ENDS ALL OCCUPATIONS happening at a crucial juncture in both the Irish peace process and in the development of the EU.

The European Union is a more dominant force than ever in the political, economic and social life of Ireland. Sinn Féin has a policy of critical but constructive engagement with the EU. This means we decide to support or oppose the many and complex developments in the EU each on its own merits. We have supported EU and other Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda - measures which are an example of the EU at its best, promoting a guarantee of a basic level of rights protection in all member states. But Sinn Féin has also never been afraid to stand up against EU measures damaging to Irish interests.

We want to build a Europe of Equals – a true partnership of equal sovereign states, co-operating in social and economic development in Europe and beyond. We want an EU that promotes peace, demilitarisation and nuclear disarmament and the just resolution of conflicts under the leadership of a reformed, renewed and democratised United Nations. Ultimately, we want a future United Ireland to take an active, leading role in such a reformed EU.

SINN FÉIN’S AGENDA FOR CHANGE

Sinn Féin is a campaigning party. We will work cooperatively with others who share our political vision to effect needed social change. Consistent with our republican agenda at home, Sinn Féin’s Agenda for Change at EU level involves actively campaigning for:
• an independent Ireland of Equals in an EU of Equals
• an EU that respects and promotes national, collective and individual rights (including human, political, social, cultural and economic rights)
• an economically and socially just EU, not an EU that is merely another economic superpower
• a demilitarised and nuclear-free EU
• a globally responsible, fair-trading EU that leads the way on reaching the Millennium Development Goals for reducing global poverty by 2015


FOR AN EU THAT ENDS ALL OCCUPATION 

The new EU of 25 must come to terms with the reality that several of its members and applicants militarily occupy other member states, enforce partitions, and deny other European nations the right to self-determination enshrined in international law. The EU must respect the right to self-determination everywhere, but especially at home. It must take a role in ensuring the speedy end to all occupations and enforced partitions.

Sinn Féin MEPs will argue our case for a United Ireland and for an end to all military occupation in the EU.

FOR AN EU TREATY WORTHY OF IRISH SUPPORT

Sinn Féin supports EU enlargement and a more inclusive EU. We welcome all new member states that comply with the Copenhagen Criteria on democracy and human rights. We also agree the EU needs major reform. We support streamlining existing treaties to make them more accessible to people, and we support measures that make the work of the EU more transparent, accountable, efficient and effective. However, while the present draft EU Constitutional Treaty proposes big changes, it does not do all we need it to do and it is not a charter for an EU of Equals.

Sinn Féin is opposed to the current draft EU Constitution. If the final Treaty does not address our concerns we will campaign for a NO vote in the future referenda. Sinn Féin calls for any new EU Treaty to ensure:
• an explicit recognition of EU member states’ right to national sovereignty and self-government, including economic self-government
• full equality in decision-making between EU partners
• an end to the practice of the EU Council meeting in camera
• the introduction of an accountable Commission
• the primacy of fair trade and the social economy over free trade
• an explicit recognition of Irish neutrality and parity of esteem for EU neutral states

PROMOTING PEACE AND IRISH INDEPENDENCE

Sinn Féin MEPs will promote the peace process on the EU stage, where it needs to be heard. We believe that the EU could play a constructive role in ensuring that the British and Irish Governments as stated parties to the Good Friday Agreement honour their commitments and do not seek nor agree to its renegotiation.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:
• act as ambassadors of the Irish peace process
• place the democratic demand for Irish unity and an end to military occupation of a part of our country the European political agenda
• work with their Sinn Féin elected colleagues throughout Ireland for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement

AN ALL-IRELAND ECONOMY IN A EUROPE OF EQUALS

Sinn Féin is committed to a process of all-Ireland economic development because we are working towards social, economic and political unification. To properly harness the all-Ireland potential, Sinn Féin proposes:
• the Six Counties adopt the euro, in order to establish an all-island currency
• the progressive harmonisation of tax regimes on the island
• the EU recognise the island as one economic unit for the purposes of EU programmes and funds
• a merger of the economic development agencies on the island to end the competition between Invest Northern Ireland (INI) with Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Development Association (IDA)

EU PEACE FUNDING

Sinn Féin MEPs will work to ensure that EU funding support for the peace process continues beyond 2004. We will also campaign at local, national, and EU levels to ensure that Peace funding reaches its maximum potential for promoting full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and for promoting national reconciliation on our island. This means:
• prioritising social inclusion
• supporting all Ireland development
• giving communities a greater say in the design and implementation of future programmes

EU STRUCTURAL FUNDING FOR ALL-ISLAND DEVELOPMENT

Sinn Féin recognises the huge potential of EU structural funding for all-island economic development, but we also recognise that the two Governments have frequently diverted these funds into the partitioned economy. We believe that EU structural funding can and must be used even more proactively to drive all-Ireland development.

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign at local, national and EU levels to ensure:
• all EU funding has an all-Ireland dimension
• a truly national development plan with all-island infrastructure at its core
• targeted investment in the disadvantaged counties (the Six Counties, the Border Counties, and particularly the North West)
• increased accessibility and accountability in the administration of EU funding
• citizens and communities can participate in deciding how the funds are applied
• all projects are equality-proofed

PLANNING FOR THE END OF OBJECTIVE ONE STATUS

From 2006 EU Objective One funding will end, and EU funding structures will change considerably. Sinn Féin believes that post-Objective One planning must be undertaken now, and on an all-Ireland basis. Sinn Féin will campaign to ensure:
• maximum EU funding is secured post-2006
• the extension of EU Peace funding and an emphasis on all-island economic development in any future EU structural funding
• community stakeholders have a say

REFOCUSING THE LISBON AGENDA

The EU economic policy known as the Lisbon Agenda aims to establish the EU as the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy by the year 2010. While the Lisbon Agenda does include progressive elements, over time a market-driven emphasis has evolved that is focused more narrowly on competitiveness, privatisation and deregulation.

Sinn Féin MEPs will call for:
• the Lisbon Agenda mid-term review in 2005 to refocus the policy on sustainable economic development, full employment and social protections
• greater emphasis on the social economy

A CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for the restoration of economic sovereignty:
• member state governments should retain complete control over taxation policy and strategy
• member state governments must be allowed to own important public sector utilities and to take necessary steps to bolster local, regional and national development strategies, including borrowing

CAMPAIGNING FOR FARMERS AND SUSTAINABLE RURAL ECONOMIES

Sinn Féin is committed to revitalising Irish agriculture and rural communities on an all-island basis. While the EU Common Agricultural policy (CAP) has brought some benefits to Irish farmers, it has also contributed to a decline in the sustainability of small to medium family farms. We believe that the reforms due to take effect as of January 2005 can provide the basis for maintaining family farms if they become part of a revised all-island strategy for the future of Irish agriculture.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• stronger all-Ireland participation in EU agricultural policy formulation
• entry of member states into the CAP on an equal basis
• establishment of a full range of complementary rural development programmes to aid farmers and rural communities
• the designation of the entire island of Ireland as a GM-free zone and a new EU embargo on GM crops and products

ACTION FOR THE IRISH FISHERIES

Sinn Féin deplores the shameful treatment of the Irish fishing industry under the EU Common Fisheries Policy.
• the radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to include a complete renegotiation of the terms governing the Irish fisheries
• an end to all threats to the Irish Box conservation area
• the statutory representation of fishing organisations in the management of stocks
• a programme to sustain coastal communities similar to the rural development aspect of the CAP

ELIMINATING POVERTY

More than 68 million people in the enlarged European Union live in poverty. As a matter of urgent priority, Sinn Féin MEPs will fight for:
• agreement of EU wide targets and timeframes for the reduction and elimination of poverty reduction and elimination and homelessness
• agreement of EU-wide standards for social protection and for combating poverty and social exclusion
• poverty-proofing of all EU law and policy
• incorporation of the social and economic rights outlined in the European Social Charter into the body of EU law

PROTECTING PUBLIC SERVICES

People have the right of equal access to quality public services, which states have the responsibility to provide and which we pay for through our taxes. Sinn Féin MEPs will fight for:
• recognition that equal access to public services is a socio-economic right deserving of protection by the EU
• removal of privatisation imperatives from the Lisbon Agenda at its mid-term review in 2005
• easing of EU restrictions on state involvement in the provision of public services

THE RIGHT TO A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT

Sinn Féin believes that a clean environment is not only a public good but a fundamental social right in need of protection. Sinn Féin MEPs will press for:
• prioritisation and mainstreaming of sustainability in EU economic policy
• timely implementation of all outstanding EU Environmental Directives
• meeting all EU obligations under the Kyoto Protocol
• a Zero Waste Strategy for Ireland and the EU that prioritises the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste
• an EU-wide standard on nuclear safety, with a monitoring role for the EU
• the closure of Sellafield, the scrapping of EURATOM, and a new agreement to progress towards a nuclear-free EU

CHAMPIONING WORKERS’ RIGHTS

Sinn Féin welcomes the EU’s commitment to “more and better jobs” and full employment in a knowledge-based economy because there are over 50 million unemployed and more than 10 million working poor in the EU. However, we share the concerns of the trade union movement that these objectives have been made subservient to corporate sector demands for labour market “flexibility”.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• full employment based on high quality and stable jobs
• a living wage for workers across Ireland and Europe
• positive incentives and other measures to enable people to overcome barriers to employment including poor education, carer responsibilities for children or elderly family members, exclusion of elderly workers, people with disabilities and asylum seekers, and long-term or generational unemployment
• ending gender discrimination and the gender pay gap
• mandatory trade union recognition
• an immediate right to employment for all EU workers in any member state
• equal access to social protections for all EU and legal non-EU migrant workers across the EU

CAMPAIGNING FOR FULL EQUALITY

Sinn Féin believes that the achievement of full equality of all people within the EU must become a higher priority objective of EU policy. The EU must lead by example on protection from discrimination and the promotion of equality.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• the introduction of a mechanism for equalityproofing all EU law and policy
• the introduction of more comprehensive EU anti-discrimination legislation including a new Gender Equality Directive, a Disability Directive and a Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender Equality Directive
• redress of the persistent democratic deficit caused by the under-representation of women on EU decision-making bodies

DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

The European Union must lead by example on the protection and promotion of human, civil and political rights. However the present reality is that 13 of the 15 established member states tolerate domestic human rights violations according to Amnesty International. Sinn Féin believes that the elimination of human rights abuses within the EU must become a higher priority objective of EU policy.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• the introduction of human rights-proofing of all EU law and policy
• the establishment of an EU Human Rights Agency
• incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into the next EU Treaty, including full enforceability
• domestic amending legislation to allow for proper full incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law in the 26 Counties
• Common Migration and Asylum Policies that are fully compliant with human rights instruments, that bring rights protections up to the highest standard, and that make the EU more open, inclusive and anti-racist

PROMOTING IRISH LANGUAGE RIGHTS

Sinn Féin will ensure that all Irish-speaking people can use the language in their dealings with domestic and European institutions as of right. In keeping with our demand for equal status for the Irish language in the EU, Sinn Féin MEPs will:
• continue to work with the STÁDAS Campaign and others for the recognition of Irish as an official working language of the EU
• address the European Parliament in Irish on a regular basis

INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY AND GLOBAL SOCIAL JUSTICE

Sinn Féin believes that EU member states should work cooperatively through the EU to exercise global responsibility in economic relations. Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for the development of a Global Social Justice Agenda for the EU, including:
• fulfilment of EU and member state commitments to the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction by 2015
• bringing the EU partners on board to match the Irish Government’s commitment to Developing Country Debt Cancellation
• a reversal of the present imbalance in EU military v. development aid spending, and a redirection of a significant portion of the €160 billion presently spent annually by EU states on defence towards the estimated €100 billion cost of cutting global poverty in half by 2015
• human rights-proofing of all EU aid and trade policies
• the adoption of a Trade Justice approach at EU level, to allow fair trade to prevail over completely unrestricted free trade
• a more effective EU Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers and the adoption of an international Arms Trade Treaty to prevent EU export of arms where they contribute to violations of human rights

PROMOTING IRISH NEUTRALITY, EU DEMILITARISATION, AND UN REFORM

Successive EU treaties since the Single European Act in 1987 have corroded independent foreign policy to the point where Irish military neutrality is virtually all we have left. But Irish neutrality is under increasing pressure from the accelerating militarisation of the EU and the decisions of an Irish Government that is no longer truly committed to the policy.

Sinn Féin MEPs will strongly promote our policy of “Positive Neutrality in Action”, which requires:
• neutrality to be enshrined in the Irish Constitution and codified in legislation
• withdrawal from the EU Rapid Reaction Force and NATO's Partnership for Peace
• Irish troops to train and serve abroad only under the auspices and leadership of the United Nations, and only with prior Dáil approval
• no use of Irish airports, airspace, seaports, or territorial waters for preparation for war or other armed conflict by foreign powers
• active promotion of the demilitarisation of the EU
• active promotion of UN primacy, as well as badly needed UN reform and capacity-building to create a revitalised UN which is capable of fulfilling the promise of the Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and of upholding international law

SINN FÉIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION

A POLICY OF CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT

The European Union is a more dominant force than ever in the political, economic and social life of Ireland. As such it demands closer attention than it gets at present.

In the Six Counties many people feel disconnected and complacent about the EU. This is partly as a result of their being denied the right to vote on any of the EU Treaties since accession in 1973. While Sinn Féin welcomes the announcement that the British Government will hold a referendum on the next EU Treaty, we are concerned about the timescale. We believe that the two Governments must respect the right of people in the Six Counties to determine relations with the EU on the basis of their common interest with the rest of the people of Ireland.

In the 26 Counties, the establishment parties have adopted a wholly uncritical attitude to any and all developments in the EU, regardless of their impact on Ireland. For too long successive governments and opposition parties have behaved like second-class citizens, accepting everything handed down to them from Brussels and Strasbourg. They have also been content for engagement with the EU to be an elitist preserve and to keep ordinary Irish people – and their concerns about the direction of the EU – out of the debate.

In contrast, Sinn Féin has a policy of critical but constructive engagement with the EU. This means we decide to support or oppose the many and complex developments in the EU each on its own merits, using the criteria of democracy, transparency and accountability, equality and human rightscompliance, the effect on Irish sovereignty and potential for promoting Irish unity.

For example, Sinn Féin has supported EU and other Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda. We argued for the inclusion of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Good Friday Agreement. We support the incorporation of the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights and the European Social Charter in EU law. We have argued for full adoption of the existing EU Equality Directives into domestic law, and for the development of new more comprehensive equality directives. These measures are an example of the EU at its best, promoting a guarantee of a basic level of rights protection in all member states.

But Sinn Féin has also never been afraid to stand up against EU measures damaging to Irish interests. We opposed previous EU treaties on this basis, including the Treaty of Nice.

The Irish Government and the EU are prepared to ignore the expressed democratic will of the Irish people in order to comply with EU demands. This was dramatically illustrated by the referendum re-run on the Nice Treaty. The people voted NO to Nice and that decision should have been respected and acted upon by the Irish Government and the other EU member states. As a result of this episode Irish people are now, quite rightly, more skeptical about democratic accountability in Ireland and the EU than ever before.

The question of democratic accountability is more important than ever because the EU has developed from what was essentially a free trade bloc into what is now a politically, socially and economically integrated entity which makes laws touching virtually every aspect of Irish life. But the EU Council still meets and takes decisions in secret, without transparency or accountability. Often the Irish people do not know how their government representatives vote in Council, and Irish Ministers have proven evasive under direct questioning. Too many controversial EU measures are being fast-tracked by the Irish Government, and rubber-stamped without debate. All this must change.

The bottom line for Sinn Féin is that democracy is built upon the sovereignty of the people expressed in the form of the democratic nation-state. We believe strongly that democracy is best exercised at local and national level where the citizen and the community have maximum input. We support cooperation at EU level where appropriate and necessary, but only if the proposed measures do not compromise democratic rights and have followed a transparent and accountable decision-making process.

Critical engagement is not an anti-European approach. Indeed, Irish republicanism has its origins in a broader European democratic movement. Today

Sinn Féin continues to build cooperative links with like-minded democratic movements throughout Europe and beyond.

Sinn Féin MEPs will not only engage critically and constructively with EU policy, they will also challenge the persisting democratic deficits in EU decisionmaking, as well as the democratic deficits here on this island.

In keeping with this commitment, Sinn Féin MEPs will:
• demand an all-island referendum on the next EU Treaty
• demand the strengthening of EU scrutiny mechanisms in the 26 Counties, which have so far failed to deliver on the promise of increased accountability and public debate
• demand further reform of the EU institutions, particularly the appointment of unaccountable Commissioners as the primary lawmakers of the EU, and the workings of the Council as the primary decision-makers of the EU

In keeping with the policy of critical engagement, Sinn Féin will assess all EU proposals against the following criteria, and support or oppose it accordingly:
• does it compromise national sovereignty or local democracy?
• does it compromise the interests of smaller nations or minority groups within those nations?
• was the proposal arrived at through democratic dialogue and consultation with civil society?
• will its outworking be transparent and subject to democratic accountability?
• will it enhance social and economic equality or have the opposite effect?
• does it promote or compromise human, political, social, economic and cultural rights?
• does it have the potential to promote Irish unity?

SINN FÉIN’S AGENDA FOR CHANGE

It is no secret that the European Union is presently dominated by the largest, wealthiest countries and is driven by a federalist agenda that seeks total integration and eventual subsuming of the member states in a federal superstate structure.

Across the political spectrum, EU federalists seek to construct an EU that would act as a world power either in concert with or in competition with the USA. This plan for EU development is reinforced by the Draft EU Constitutional Treaty, which continues the evolution of the EU as an economic and military superpower, internally unequal and dominated by a few powerful states.

Sinn Féin is firmly opposed to the federalist agenda. We have our own positive vision for what the EU could be.

We want to build an EU that is a true partnership of equal states, co-operating in social and economic development in Europe and beyond. We want an EU that promotes peace, demilitarisation and nuclear disarmament and the just resolution of conflicts under the leadership of a reformed, renewed and democratised United Nations. Ultimately, we want a future United Ireland to take an active, leading role in such a reformed EU.

Consistent with our republican priorities at home, the Sinn Féin Agenda for Change at EU level involves actively campaigning for:
• an independent Ireland of Equals in an EU of Equals
• a demilitarised EU
• an EU that respects and promotes national, collective and individual rights (including human, political, social, cultural and economic rights)
• an economically and socially just EU, not an EU that is merely another economic superpower
• a globally responsible EU that leads the way on reaching the Millennium Development Goals for reducing global poverty by 2015
• a nuclear-free EU
• a fair-trading EU

In keeping with our Agenda for Change, Sinn Féin’s commitment in the European Parliament is to:
• work for a reformed EU that gives power back to the people
• promote Irish sovereignty, democracy and neutrality
• advance all-Ireland approaches to economic and social issues with the active assistance of the EU
• seek new priorities for EU policy including the elimination of poverty
• ensure that all EU law and policy respects and promotes equality and human rights
• build political alliances with like-minded parties and civil society groups in Ireland and across the EU to advance these goals

FOR AN EU THAT ENDS ALL OCCUPATIONS

With few exceptions, every state in the enlarged EU has known invasion and military occupation by another EU state in the recent past. Peoples in EU states have suffered the persecution and discrimination associated with occupation, and have also engaged in armed resistance. The people of all these European states know where Republicans are coming from.

Military occupations of one state by another in Europe have largely ceased. But there are exceptions. The new EU of 25 must come to terms with the reality that several of its members and applicants militarily occupy other member states, enforce partitions, and deny other European nations the right to self-determination enshrined in international law.

The EU must respect the right to self-determination everywhere, but especially at home – in Brittany, in Galicia, in Catalonia, in Corsica, in Cyprus, in the Basque Country, in Kurdistan, in Scotland, in Wales and in Ireland.

The EU must take a role in ensuring the speedy end to these occupations and forced partitions. While this issue has been acknowledged with respect to Cyprus, it must be confronted in all states where it occurs.

But the EU presently tacitly condones and acquiesces in this wrongful occupation. The EU allows the British Government to negotiate on behalf of a part of Ireland, even where the interests of the people of the Six Counties are by no means coincidental with the interests London brings to the table.

Just as we look to the EU community of nations to endorse the peace process in our country, we equally expect EU support for our just call for an end to the British military occupation of a part of our island and for Irish reunificaiton.

Sinn Féin MEPs will argue our case for a United Ireland and an end to all military occupation in the EU:
• all occupations in the EU must end
• the reunified and newly-liberated nations must be included as full EU members
• other EU member states should remember their own past, recognise the Irish right to self-determination, and cease their recognition of and collaboration with Britain’s ongoing occupation of Ireland

SUPPORTING A MORE INCLUSIVE EU

Sinn Féin welcomes the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 members as of 01 May 2004.

We welcome a more inclusive EU, and will welcome the future accession of all applicant states fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria on democracy and respect for human rights and whose populations have endorsed EU membership by referendum.

There can be no exclusion of applicant states on the basis of a false racially or religiously exclusive notion of what is “European”, and we reject the development of a Euro “supranationalism” based on any notion of cultural or other superiority.

We oppose the accession of Turkey at this time on the basis that it has not yet met the Copenhagen requirements with respect to human rights, because it continues to militarily occupy Cyprus and also denies the Kurdish people their right to self-determination. However, once Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria and ended their occupations, we would welcome the further diversification of the EU by its inclusion as a predominantly Muslim but secular state.

We also welcome enlargement because it has the potential to change the balance of power in what has been an elitist club dominated by a few wealthy powerful states and serving their interests.

As a small nation with a history of colonisation, Ireland has much in common with both the smaller accession states and the economically marginal former Eastern Bloc states. We are convinced that the greater number of peripheral EU states have the potential to counterbalance the power of the core EU states. Together, we have a far greater chance of creating an EU of Equals. To this end, Sinn Féin will work on the basis of common interest to forge alliances with other progressive states, other neutral states, other small states, and any other progressive forces in the EU.

While we are wary of the implications of the accession of so many more NATO states to the already NATO-dominated EU, we specifically welcome the accession of another militarily neutral state, Malta.

On the issue of future EU enlargement Sinn Féin believes that:
• all new member states must comply with the Copenhagen Criteria on democracy and human rights
• new member states must join the EU on the basis of full equality with established member states
• all EU workers should have the immediate right to employment and the equal right to social protections in any EU state
• we need more public discussion and debate on the proposed establishment of a EuroMediterranean Free Trade Area involving the EU, Middle Eastern and North African states (through what is known as the Barcelona Process) and its implications for the future direction of the EU and global geopolitics

FOR AN EU TREATY WORTHY OF SUPPORT

Sinn Féin agrees that the simplification and consolidation of existing EU Treaties is necessary. But such a process must not be used to diminish national sovereignty and increase the centralised power of the EU as does the proposed Draft EU Constitution.

We are adamantly opposed to the creation of an EU superstate – even by increments. The proposed Draft EU Constitution moves the EU further down this federalist road. It makes fundamental changes in the structures of the EU. It gives those structures more powers. It shifts the balance of power yet further from sovereign national parliaments and towards the EU, taking the single biggest step so far in the creation of an EU superstate. It entrenches the inequality of the EU by enhancing the power of the larger states. It also advances the project to turn the EU into a superpower.

As it stands, the draft EU Constitutional Treaty is not worthy of Irish support because:
• it does not respect national sovereignty, and increases the superiority of EU law to national law
• it does not respect economic sovereignty, but continues to impede the right of states to control their own economies
• it establishes a number of new features that are normally the accoutrements of states, including a single legal personality and a Foreign Minister
• it ends the already qualified right of each state to appoint a voting Commissioner
• it further extends Qualified Majority Voting (QMV), which is an unequal decision-making process
• it does not clearly favour a social market economy over the market-driven economy demanded by big business
• it gives the EU primacy in all areas of foreign policy and allows for the progressive establishment of an EU Common Defence; it directs states to contribute forces and increase military spending; it requires mutual defence of EU member states; it allows for EU military intervention as part of counterinsurgency campaigns; and it privileges NATO states over neutral states – all of which undermine Irish military neutrality
• it increases EU control over criminal law and policing matters, and does so without guaranteeing access to best procedures and protections
• it increases the EU democratic deficit instead of reducing it

The opportunity to undertake fundamental positive reform in the EU has been squandered by both the drafters (the Convention on the Future of Europe) and the negotiators (the EU Council, including the Irish EU Presidency) of the Draft EU Constitution.

The Draft EU Constitution is not a charter for an EU of Equals. Unless significant changes are made along the lines that Sinn Féin recommended to the Irish Government nearly a year ago, Sinn Féin will be unable to support the new Treaty, and will once again have to campaign on the NO side in the referenda north and south.

Sinn Féin calls for any new EU Treaty to ensure:
• an explicit recognition of EU member states’ right to national sovereignty and self-government, including economic self-government
• the primacy of fair trade and the social economy over free trade
• an explicit recognition of Irish neutrality and parity of esteem for EU neutral states
• an end to the practice of the EU Council meeting in camera
• an end to weighted voting and a reintroduction of equality in decision-making between EU partners
• the introduction of an accountable Commission
• a more detailed definition of all EU competences (areas of jurisdiction), contraction of EU competence to the minimum necessary areas, and an end to exclusive EU competence
• recognition of the right to scrutiny by national parliaments and regional and local governments, and the introduction of a standard scrutiny mechanism
• meaningful sanctions allowing national parliaments and regional and local governments to enforce the principle of subsidiarity (that decisions should always be made as closely as possible to the citizen)

Sinn Féin will also push for the domestic changes necessary to redress the democratic deficit here at home, including:
• citizens of all 32 counties to be consulted by referendum on any future EU treaty changes – and such referendum results to be binding on the Governments
• a review of the operation of the 26 County EU Scrutiny Act 2002 by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on EU Affairs, as provided for under Section 5 of the Act, to include a meaningful public consultation process
• a full Dáil debate on Government positions in advance of each EU Summit meeting or InterGovernmental Conference, allowing for the recording of votes on each measure where there is no consensus – the result of which should be binding on the Taoiseach and reflected in Government positions represented at Council
• involvement of the relevant Oireachtas Committee/s in EU policy development prior to Ministers taking decisions, and a requirement on all Ministers to brief their Committees in advance of Council of Ministers meetings on how they plan to vote on EU proposals
• Committees to debate and vote on proposed Government positions in order to register opposition if necessary; a vote defeating the position should result in referral of the matter for full debate and vote by the Dáil with the result of the Dáil vote to be binding on the Minister and reflected in the Government position represented at Council
• a standard procedure for Oireachtas Committees to deal with EU proposals referred to them by the Oireachtas Subcommittee on Scrutiny, requiring them to debate and vote on the proposals; and requiring a public report summarising the arguments for and against the proposal, or indicating the reasons for consensus where it is recommended that a motion accepting the proposal be put to the Dáil without debate
• a direct relationship between the northern Assembly and the EU with respect to both legislation and funding programmes
• the recalled Assembly to appoint a Minister for Europe, establish an EU Scrutiny Committee, and introduce Question Time to make northern MEPs more accountable to the regional administration
• reconfiguration of the Seanad to give it primary responsibility for EU scrutiny, as per Sinn Féin’s Seanad Reform proposals
• full membership in the Forum on Europe for representatives of northern political parties, to make the Forum truly “national”
• the Forum on Europe to carry out a rolling consultative process with communities and civil society groups across the 32 Counties
• the All-Ireland Consultative Forum proposed in the Good Friday Agreement to act as a grassroots monitoring body for direct scrutiny by Irish citizens and voters of the performance of Irish MEPs, the Irish Commissioner, and Irish Government at EU level, with the power to refer all EU proposals to an all-Ireland Human Rights Commission

A SINN FÉIN TEAM IN EUROPE

Sinn Féin will work all levels of democracy, from local councils in Ireland to the EU Parliament in Strasbourg, to ensure that our demands for national self-determination, democracy, and economic and social justice are addressed and advanced.

Sinn Féin MEPs will promote Sinn Féin’s Agenda for Change by engaging critically – but constructively with the institution, just as we do with the Dáil and the Assembly.

Our MEPs will also engage cooperatively with other progressive forces in and outside of the EU institutions, and with likeminded groups and movements in Europe (and outside Europe) on the issues that matter, including human rights, equality, democracy and opposition to militarism.

We understand that the nature of the European Parliament is to act as a watchdog on EU Commission and EU Council – and that is what Sinn Féin elected activists do best.

Equally, the nature of co-decision procedure and Committee procedures involves negotiation. The Sinn Féin team have unparalleled expertise in tough international level negotiations, and we will bring this to Strasbourg.

Sinn Féin MEPs:
• will ensure that the rights and interests of Irish people are stoutly defended at EU level
• will do our best to ensure that Six County and 26 County interests are represented in negotiations on an all-Ireland basis, and that the interests of people in the Six Counties are not neglected in favour of London’s dominating separate interests
• will not shrink when confronted with the might of the Commission or the more powerful EU states, and will not be made to feel second-class citizens in the EU
• will challenge the assertion that the present EU is inevitable, and will bring our firm conviction that another EU is possible, given the political will to change it
• recognise that the EU is only one part of a bigger picture
• will not allow our participation in the EU to divert our attention from our other priorities such as our peace process at home or, on the international stage, UN reform (as the most inclusive, democratic and therefore legitimate multilateral forum)

THE EU AND THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA

PROMOTING PEACE AND IRISH INDEPENDENCE

The last EU election took place in 1999, the year after the people of Ireland overwhelmingly ratified the Good Friday Agreement. The story of the Irish peace process since then has been the story of the efforts to implement what people voted for.

Time and again the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been thwarted by the British Government at the behest of the unionist parties. On four occasions the democratic institutions established under the Agreement have been suspended by the British Government. The institutions have now been in suspension since October 2002. The crisis continues because of the unwillingness of unionism to come to terms with the changes promised under the Good Friday Agreement and because of the failure of the British Government to fulfil its commitments.

The British Government has failed to reform policing in line with the Patten Report. It has failed to remove the British army and all its barracks and posts which intrude in the lives of the people. It has failed to repeal repressive laws and implement basic standards of human and civil rights. It has failed to ensure equality of status for Irish speakers. It has failed to come clean on its role in arming unionist paramilitary death squads and killing hundreds of citizens on both sides of the border. And on top of all this the Irish Government has failed to challenge the British Government on its breaches of the Good Friday Agreement, while also failing to fulfil many of its own commitments.

Despite these huge difficulties, Sinn Féin has spared no effort to revive the peace process and to ensure the restoration of the institutions through dialogue and negotiation. Sinn Féin has shown our willingness to take difficult decisions and to persuade others to do so. This commitment has helped to ensure the maintenance of the IRA cessations for most of the past decade and has secured three significant acts putting arms beyond use. Republicans have fulfilled their commitments and will continue to do so.

Real equality threatens no-one but will enhance the lives of nationalists and unionists alike. On this basis, we will work with all who share this island to build lasting peace.

Sinn Féin MEPs will bring this message to the EU stage, where it needs to be heard. We believe that, in keeping with its stated commitment to international peace and conflict resolution, the EU could play a constructive role in ensuring that the British and Irish Governments as state parties to the Good Friday Agreement honour their commitments and do not seek nor agree to its renegotiation.

Sinn Féin MEPs will:
• act as ambassadors of the Irish peace process
• place the democratic demand for Irish unity and an end to military occupation of a part of our country the European political agenda
• work with their Sinn Féin elected colleagues throughout Ireland for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement
• co-operate with Irish MEPs of all political traditions in the common interests of the people of Ireland
• give fair representation to all sections of the community

EU FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS

The European Union has recognised the importance of the peace process to the stability of both Ireland and the EU as a whole.

We commend the EU for its significant practical support for the peace process, particularly through its Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, the Peace I and Peace II Programmes, which have enhanced the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement.

Much of the potential for peace building, reconciliation and conflict resolution in Ireland remains unrealised however, and Sinn Féin therefore will work for the continuation of EU Peace funding after 2004.

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign at local, national, and EU levels to ensure that future Peace funding reaches its maximum potential for promoting national reconciliation and its precursors: an end to discrimination, the promotion of diversity, and the recognition of the interdependence of all individuals and communities on the island.

SINN FÉIN PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE EU PEACE FUNDING

Future EU Peace funding must support a managed process of national reconciliation through the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. It is therefore crucial that future Peace funding be developed and managed in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.

Sinn Féin proposes that future Peace funding needs to be managed with specific reference to conflict resolution and peace-building. Therefore:
• it should not become part of the general Community Support Framework because it is about more than just community development
• it should continue to be a Special Programme linked to the family of rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes run by the EU Commission’s External Affairs Directorate
• the priority of purely economic initiatives (as in the Peace I and Peace II Programmes) should end, and economic sustainability should not be the over-riding criteria
• its programmes should encourage management for the transition from conflict, and its projects should aim to complete particular post-conflict tasks, such as the reintegration of prisoners back into community and family life and victims initiatives
• its programmes should be guided by the principle of social inclusion and targeted to benefit those areas subjected to unequal distribution of public resources or that suffered disproportionately due to the conflict
• it should promote and encourage the development of all-island projects and networks as central to the process of national reconstruction

Reconciliation cannot be built on the basis of inequality. Future Peace funding must therefore be used to tackle inequality in the social, economic, linguistic, political and cultural spheres, and to promote social inclusion. A key element of this is community empowerment. This must involve:
• using the social economy model for sustainable socio-economic development to combat poverty and social exclusion in the areas of greatest disadvantage and where the conflict was most intense over the last 30-40 years
• inclusion without discrimination of those who have suffered directly as a result of the conflict, including those who regard themselves as “victims”, those who regard themselves as “survivors” and those who have been imprisoned as a result of the conflict
• participatory involvement of workers in the design of initiatives to increase the safety, security and peace of mind of those underrepresented in the workplace
• strengthening community capacity for equalityproofing, and for monitoring outcomes and improvements in status and changes in attitude and practice on the part of public officials and institutions
• using community development models to underpin the evolution of public administration in the North
• recognising and supporting the role of the community and voluntary sector in the maintenance and development of the Irish speaking community

Future Peace funding must also not repeat the administrative shortcomings of past programmes. This requires:
• distribution of funding in line with objective need
• prioritising of community-based projects over business initiatives
• the promotion of all-Ireland networks
• a more hands-on role for the European Commission whose mediation is needed to ensure maximum benefit from available funds
• restoring the previous monitoring role of the Community Consultative Forum under Peace I for greater transparency
• less bureaucracy and complexity in application and processing procedures to prevent prejudice against smaller groups in disadvantaged areas

PROMOTING THE ALL-IRELAND DIMENSION AN ISLAND ECONOMY IN A EUROPE OF EQUALS

Sinn Féin is committed to a process of all-Ireland economic development because we are working towards social, economic and political unification. This is the core of the republican agenda.

Others have increasingly recognised that the single greatest structural impediment to coherent economic development in Ireland is the existence of two constitutional, administrative and economic systems. This has also been acknowledged by the European Union.

While there is no disputing that various EU initiatives set up to integrate economies and eradicate borders across the EU have already had some positive impact here, the EU’s role to date in promoting the allIreland dimension of the republican agenda – an island economy – has been a mixed one of opportunities and constraints.

The opportunities have mostly taken the form of EU structural funding with the potential to enhance allIreland infrastructure. Sinn Féin believes that the EU structural funds can and must be used even more proactively to drive all-Ireland economic development.

The constraints have taken two forms. One is the persistent diversion of EU support to the partitioned economy by the Irish and British Governments. The other is the direction of the EU economic policy, which remains fundamentally at odds with the project of Irish economic sovereignty and the development of a vibrant dynamic all-Ireland economy.

Sinn Féin’s critical enagement approach to the EU in relation to economic matters is guided by this analysis and our focused pursuit of the all-Ireland dimension of the Good Friday Agreement.

BEYOND THE PARTITIONED ECONOMY

While we readily acknowledge that the EU has played a valuable role in all-Ireland development to date, it also should not be overstated. In the referendum debates for the Rome and Maastricht treaties in 1972 and 1992 we were promised that EU membership would make partition meaningless.

But more than 30 years later the island economy remains embryonic. We still have a partitioned economy with two currencies, two tax regimes and often conflicting development agendas.

This needs to change. We need a new impetus at national and EU levels.

To properly harness the all-Ireland potential, Sinn Féin proposes that:
• the Six Counties adopt the euro, in order to establish an all-island currency
• the EU recognise the island as one economic unit for the purposes of EU programmes and funds
• the EU allow Ireland the same latitude for overcoming the negative economic effects of partition presently given exclusively to Germany in the proposed EU Constitution

Sinn Féin proposes that the two governments:
• begin the process of harmonising tax regimes in consultation with trade unions and business organisations and all the political parties on the island
• merge the economic development agencies and end the competition between Invest Northern Ireland (INI) on one side with Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Development Association (IDA) on the other.

Sinn Féin MEPs will pursue the potential for the EU to make an even greater positive contribution to allIreland economic development.

EU STRUCTURAL FUNDING FOR ALL-ISLAND DEVELOPMENT

EU Regional Policy has designed and funded many worthwhile social and regional economic development initiatives that have had a limited but measurable positive impact on an all-island basis.

In particular the EU’s Structural Programmes have offered new opportunities for harmonising policies and organisational networks throughout the island.

The Structural and Cohesion Funds have begun to reshape the economic infrastructure of Ireland as a European region and have facilitated an economic network stretching from Cork to Derry.

Since its inception EU Objective One funding has provided essential support for economic growth across the island. Future structural funding needs to

further develop the all-island economic infrastructure and break any remaining obstacles to balanced economic development as a means of transition into a stable, sustainable and peaceful economy and society.

One important aspect of EU structural funding has been its potential to tackle disadvantage and inequality. Sinn Féin has actively monitored this, particularly at local level.

We found that at a local and community level the effects of the funding were less beneficial than expected. This was most apparent where government did not use EU money as a supplement to existing funding for community and economic development, but instead used it as a substitute.

In addition, the European Court of Auditors is aware of the mismanagement of funds by certain projects in the Six Counties. This issue still needs to be addressed, and the EU needs to reassert its role in co-ordinating the funds to prevent any future abuse.

For the structural funds to 2006 and beyond, there needs to be an ongoing coherent and vibrant allisland dimension. There must also be an analysis of the impact of previous initiatives to inform the current and future funding rounds, as well as clear and quantifiable plans and objectives.

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign at local, national and EU levels to ensure that:
• government departments that administer the EU structural funding are more accountable to elected representatives and the general public
• citizens and communities can participate in deciding how the funds are applied in their areas
• all grants are accessible and transparently processed with accounts placed in the public domain
• there is equality of treatment in the application of funding
• all projects are equality-proofed
• the social, voluntary and public sectors get greater access to funding
• economically disadvantaged and marginalised areas and communities get priority investment
• there is targeted investment in the disadvantaged counties (the Six Counties, the Border Counties, and particularly the North West) in terms of infrastructure, arterial routes and networks, indigenous business development, rural diversification, and initiatives to tackle outward migration
• economic development is monitored on a regional basis to determine the real effects of the programmes on sectors and areas, particularly with respect to the core problem of long-term unemployment
• training for the new economic sectors becomes commonplace and accessible to all
• more consideration is shown to the environmental consequences of EU funded projects

“BUILDING SUSTAINABLE PROSPERITY” IN THE SIX COUNTIES

The total package of EU structural funding to the North to 2006 is worth STG£1 billion, of which STG£575 million is the spending programme Building Sustainable Prosperity (BSP). This programme has contributed to the development of the economy in the Six Counties over the past four years and has had a generally positive impact on the quality of life. Its projects and schemes have brought infrastructural and capital investment in business, urban regeneration, support for rural communities, ending long-term unemployment and environmental protection.

The BSP programme has the potential to be especially relevant to the communities most affected by the legacy of economic decline and ongoing effects of conflict. The programme plan has targeted those areas and sectors with immense potential for the economy at community level – small to medium enterprises and indigenous firms with the potential to expand.

Sinn Féin has actively supported the BSP programme since its inception, both in terms of co-ordinating community responses to the application procedures and in monitoring the ongoing development of the projects. At council and community level we have encouraged participation and dialogue to support the EU and BSP contribution to the transition to a more peaceful, stable, prosperous and fair society.

Sinn Féin has also encouraged all-island links through business and infrastructural development, and the practice of operational integration to generate an allisland economic sphere within the context of the European Union.

However, Sinn Féin has a number of concerns regarding the administration of the BSP funds, their targeting and priorities, and the extent of their commitment to all-island economic integration.

The BSP programme is set to close in 2006. For the remaining period of the BSP funding, Sinn Féin MEPs will monitor and campaign at the local, national and EU level to ensure:
• the socio-economic partners who deliver the funding better reflect the mix of society within the Six Counties
• elimination of conflict of interest from programming, monitoring and evaluation
• greater transparency in programme administration to address suspicion about mismanagement and to build public confidence in the administration of EU funding
• an end to preferential treatment and subsidies for some sectors by the NIO and Department of Finance and Personnel
• more focus on local and small enterprise and those businesses which can stimulate growth at a local level
• recognition of the importance of the social economy for effective regeneration
• the BSP programme’s potential to enhance the all-island economy is utilised more effectively

THE 26 COUNTIES AND THE “NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN”

Successive British, Unionist and Irish administrations deliberately neglected the development of substantial sections of rural Ireland. The results of this neglect are most acute in the North West region of the Six and 26 Counties.

Today, despite a significant injection of EU structural funds and a so-called “National” Development Plan for the 26 Counties, underdevelopment of power, transport and communications infrastructure persists in this region.

Sinn Féin wants to see an end to this. We need a truly national development programme with all-island infrastructure at its core.

There is a fresh urgency to this issue, because the present EU structural funding programme ends in 2006, and the Commission has announced a sharp reduction in regional funding to Ireland from 20072013.

We welcome the recent relaxation of the EU Structural and Cohesion Fund criteria. EU funding should now be used to support the development of all-island energy and ICT infrastructure, as well as all-island transport infrastructure.

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for a focused all-Ireland initiative involving local government, the development agencies, the service providers, and local and regional interest groups coming together to plan a strategy with firm targets for the delivery of projects including:
• the Western Rail Corridor and the possible rebuilding of the Dublin-Derry rail link
• an agreed timetable for the N2/A5 upgrade
• a guaranteed full broadband service to all towns regardless of size
• energy initiatives to solve the current power shortages that are constraining economic development in the North West
• locally-run training and education programmes to tackle the digital divide
• accelerated implementation of the Innovation North West Programme

THE SPECIAL EU PROGRAMMES BODY AND INTERREG

INTERREG is a programme financed under the EU Regional Development Fund to stimulate interregional cooperation, balanced development, and economic and social cohesion.

The Special EU Programmes Body (SPEUB) was set up under the All-Ireland Ministerial Council as the designated managing authority for both PEACE and INTERREG. The SPEUB has an additional role in coordinating the all-Ireland dimensions of the other EU support programmes on the island, such as EQUAL, LEADER and URBAN.

All of these funds are intended to tackle social and economic marginalisation by building capacity in deprived areas throughout the island, and are interwoven into the respective development policies on the island. For example, the 26/6 Counties Regional Development Plans each share a Common Chapter that outlines areas of cooperation on a cross-border basis. The Common Chapters recognise that the border corridor is the most deprived area on the island. The primary fund used to redress this is INTERREG IIIA.

The operational programme for INTERREG IIIA recognises the detrimental impact of the border in its acknowledgment that communities and businesses in areas adjacent to the border suffer from similar social, economic and infrastructural disadvantages. Consequently, the objective of INTERREG IIIA is to overcome the social, economic and environmental problems caused by the border.

Fundable projects must demonstrate full integration.

As such, INTERREG and the SPEUB have enormous potential to develop the all-Ireland dimension that is critical to the republican agenda. Sinn Féin seeks to develop this opportunity to the fullest possible extent.

There is scope to go further. For example, we must access the two other INTERREG III strands, B and C, which so far have not been used to a fraction of their potential. Both of these funds offer the opportunity to promote large, area-based regional development projects on an all-Ireland basis.

Working in Europe and collectively on the island of Ireland, Sinn Féin MEPs will work to ensure:
• the SPEUB has the resources and autonomy to act as the overall authority for the implementation of the all-Ireland aspects of the EU structural fund programmes including INTERREG III A, B, and C, and INTERREG IV
• the SPEUB has the resources and autonomy to act as the overall authority for the implementation of the all-Ireland aspects of the EU Community Initiative Programmes including EQUAL, LEADER and URBAN
• more SPEUB development and advisory staff with the skills to promote cross-border and all-Ireland integration
• that all relevant EU structural funds are utilised strategically in each of the three border corridor zones (North West, Central and Eastern) to tackle the social, economic and infrastructural marginalisation endured by border communities and businesses, and to promote greater social, economic and spatial cohesion through the development of Integrated Area Plans for the Border Corridor

THE IMPENDING CLOSURE OF OBJECTIVE ONE STATUS

The EU’s designation of the island of Ireland as a high priority “Objective One” regional funding recipient will end in 2006.

In the short term Objective One funding propped-up the economy in all parts of the island and facilitated growth across a number of sectors, primarily the high-technology and tourist industries.

We don’t yet know the long-term effects of the loss of billions of euros in capital and revenue funding on our island economy.

From 2006 the EU funding structure will change consideraby. We will no longer talk about “Objective” status. The majority of funding will go towards a “Cohesion Priority” which Ireland will not be eligible for. However Ireland will be entitled to apply for two other Priorities. Funding will be available for competitiveness and employment through programmes like URBAN, European Social Fund and European Regional Development Fund, and for territorial co-operation, for example through the INTERREG Fund.

The impact of the closure of Objective One status must be publicly examined and debated, and postObjective One planning undertaken now and on an all-island basis.

Sinn Féin calls for a coherent all-island development strategy post-Objective One.

Sinn Féin MEPs will argue for:
• the maximum allocation of EU funding post 2006
• all-island action plans and remedial targets to stabilise the social and economic infrastructure prior to the closure of Objective One
• an emphasis on all-Ireland economic interdependence
• the creation of a strategic all-island development plan which redresses the island-wide east-west imbalance and offers a joint approach for development of the Six Counties, the Border regions, and the North West
• equality-proofing and an end to political vetting
• greater community involvement in the design and implementation of future programmes
• an emphasis on the alleviation of poverty and social exclusion, and the social economy

THE CONSTRAINTS OF EU ECONOMIC CONTROL

One of the big problems with economic policy formulation in the EU is the question of who makes the decisions. With every new EU treaty member states cede more power and control over decision making to unelected unaccountable bodies like the European Central Bank and the EU Commission. Where economic measures are still decided by the EU Council, the introduction of Qualified Majority Voting has ensured an unequal distribution of power and influence between member states because the bigger states have more voting power than the smaller states.

Sinn Féin believes that increased centralisation of economic power and decision-making in the hands of unelected, unaccountable and unequal EU bodies is wrong.

EU economic control has not only eliminated our economic sovereignty, it is actively interfering in our ability to shape a socially just and sustainable allisland economy.

We need the EU to actively support the creation of a full-employment economy that houses, educates, transports and provides healthcare and social security to all. Unfortunately the EU is not doing this because it is driven by flawed and contradictory economic polices that privilege profits over people.

Paradoxically, EU economic control is pushing member states further away from the “Social Market” than ever.

THE EURO ZONE RULES

EU control over macroeconomic policy derives from the introduction of the euro as a common currency adopted by a majority of member states including the 26 Counties.

The protocols and directives that underpin the common currency have serious implications for the economic policies of Euro Zone states. For example, the euro rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact dictate that member states cannot allow budget deficits to exceed 3% of GNP. This strangles efforts to borrow for investment in infrastructural development, or to kickstart a sluggish economy. Under the rules, member states are often prevented from taking economic decisions that are in the best interests of their people. This is why an increasing number of member states are being found in breach of the rules, and risk incurring large fines.

But the double standard of the two-tier EU and the unequal power wielded by the larger member states has become more apparent in the case of these Stability and Growth Pact violations. When France and Germany failed to meet the stability criteria the EU Council let them off without reprimand. This is because the large states can control decisions as a result of their favourable voting weights under Qualified Majority Voting (QMV). It is a prime example of why we need to create an EU of Equals.

Needless to say, participation in the euro has required the Irish Government to contain borrowing. Despite the fact that the state’s GDP-debt ratio is

one of the lowest in the EU, participation in the euro means that the state could attract penalties if it increases borrowing.

We badly need infrastructural investment. With our critically under-funded health service, severe educational disadvantage compared to other EU states, a housing crisis that could take 40 years to solve at current rates and persistent deficits in transport, power and communications we need to take significant investment decisions even if that means incurring debt now in order to build for the future. For this reason 26 County participation in the common currency is hindering our economic development.

However, the common currency issue is not straightforward for republicans. Our preference is for an independent all-Ireland currency. However we recognise that in the context of the 26 County adoption of the euro, Britain’s insistence on remaining outside the Euro Zone (until at least 2011) has reinforced the negative effects of partition in Ireland, since two currencies continue to operate and the Six Counties continues to be held hostage by sterling.

Consistent with our commitments to economic sovereignty and the development of an all-island economy Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for:
• a return to the principle of consensus decisionmaking among member states on EU economic policies and strategies
• a complete renegotiation of the Stability and Growth Pact with a focus on flexibility, and a recognition that the present one-size-fits-all policy is neither fair nor workable
• the adoption of the euro in the Six Counties, as the next best option to an independent all-island currency

CONDITIONAL EU INVESTMENT

Whereas other EU states have established extensive infrastructure built through state-led projects, Ireland’s infrastructure remains relatively backward, especially in the border regions.

The Irish people appreciate that the EU has invested substantially in our infrastructural development over our 30 years of EU membership. However, the EU is now making any new investment in infrastructure conditional on opening public sector utilities like our airports, power stations and communication networks to private sector ownership or only allowing any new

infrastructural projects if they are funded through socalled Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) or Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs).

Since Ireland has not had the benefit of extensive past state infrastructural investment and is still trying to catch up, this new conditionality unfairly penalises us. It is discriminatory.

Sinn Féin cannot accept these constraints on Irish economic sovereignty and we will not accept the imposition of a privatisation imperative by the EU not least because there is evidence from other jurisdictions that it causes more economic and social damage than benefit.

We need all-Ireland state-led and managed infrastructural development. We also want a wellrun dynamic public sector delivering quality services on the principle of equal access on an island-wide basis. We believe that this is the standard the EU should insist on.

Sinn Féin MEPs will demand:
• that the EU remove the investment conditionality and assist member states to develop their own infrastructural development strategies
• that the EU respect member states’ right to establish new state industries and companies if it is in the interests of their people
• an EU-wide examination of the real effects on privatisation focusing on the real costs to consumers and workers, the quality and safety of goods and services produced, and a measure of how real competition is in the newly privatised sectors

THE LISBON AGENDA - A FLAWED ECONOMIC POLICY

The dictates of an EU economic policy that is fundamentally flawed place another major constraint on the development of a socially just and sustainable all-island economy.

Faced with a virtually stagnant EU economy, political leaders and EU officials developed an economic plan known as the Lisbon Agenda. The Lisbon Agenda aims to establish the EU as the world’s most competitive knowledge based economy by the year 2010.

The first fundamental premise behind the Lisbon Agenda is that increasing competitiveness is the key to resolving the economic problems of the EU.

The second fundamental underlying premise is that increased competitiveness requires privatisation of public companies and public service provision. This has resulted in an EU imperative to open every area of service provision to privatisation including gas, electricity, public procurement, roads, and public transport.

But privatisation does not result in the promised “trickle down” benefits for either consumers or workers.

For example, privatisation of the Irish telecommunications market has led to increased line rental costs for fixed-line customers. The Eircom privatisation resulted in massive losses to small shareholders and the worst of both worlds for consumers, who have neither the benefits of a single supplier nor of diversity and competition. The EUcreated duopoly in the Irish mobile market has led to Irish customers paying the highest mobile charges in the EU, and privatisation of the Irish electricity market has resulted in higher costs for households. In the north, the private monopoly gas supplier has raised its charges by one third in the last year.

Privatisation also dictates increased labour market “flexibility” which really means changing labour market legislation to reduce the bargaining power of unions and reduce labour costs – meaning lower wages and benefits.

Another flaw in the current EU economic policy is its concentration on transnational exporters as the primary economic drivers. This exclusive focus does not create sustainable economies. Important sectors are being overlooked, and the needs of smaller business and the social economy barely figure on the EU agenda.

When first proposed in 2000 the Lisbon Agenda was supposed to balance increasing competitiveness with sustainable economic development, increased employment and social protections. In practice, however, a higher priority has been assigned to competitiveness, privatisation and deregulation. The progressive elements of the Lisbon Agenda have lapsed into second class status. Taken together with the EU’s other big-business driven emphasis on spending controls and inflation targets the Lisbon Agenda now threatens to have a negative impact on the lives of ordinary people.

Sinn Féin wants an holistic approach to EU economic policy that recognises fairly the contribution and roles of all sectors: public and private, international and domestic, exporters and service providers, social and community.

We also want an Irish and European economy genuinely underpinned by the principles of sustainable development, that will use the considerable economic wealth and resources available to exert a positive influence on the global economy.

In practice this means ensuring fair trading relationships with less developed regions and states. It means EU transnational companies must respect and promote the dignity and human rights of their workforces wherever they are. It also means that the EU must put sustainable economic growth strategies at the heart of its economic policy-making.

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for:
• the Lisbon Agenda mid-term review in 2005 to end the almost exclusive focus on competitiveness and privatisation and refocus on the original balance with sustainable economic development, full employment and social protections
• a recognition that the increased tax-take from “more and better jobs” must result in better provision of public services such as healthcare, education, and transport – the Lisbon Agenda must work towards setting minimum standards for state provision and must not result in any erosion of public services
• greater emphasis on the social economy

A CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY

While economic cooperation and coordination among EU partners should of course continue, Sinn Féin does not believe that it is in the best interests of the member states including Ireland for the EU to exercise exclusive competence in (control over) economic matters. There needs to be increased control by and accountability to the elected governments of individual member states.

Sinn Féin also wants EU economic policy to be determined by a more equal decision-making process in the Council of Ministers (in co-decision with the European Parliament).

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for the restoration of economic sovereignty:
• member state governments should retain complete control over taxation policy and strategy
• member state governments must be allowed to own important public sector utilities and to take necessary steps to bolster local, regional and national development strategies
• fiscal and other economic decisions should be coordinated at an EU level but the need for unanimity and the primacy of member state governments must be re-instated

CAMPAIGNING FOR FARMERS AND SUSTAINABLE RURAL ECONOMIES

Sinn Féin is committed to revitalising Irish agriculture and rural communities on an all-island basis. While we are convinced that this will require greater local democratic control over the policies and programmes that will ensure this, we also recognise the central role that the EU currently plays.

While the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has brought some benefits to Irish farmers, it has also contributed to a decline in the sustainability of small to medium family farms. Even the Agriculture Commissioner has admitted that CAP has compromised the long-term prospects of rural areas.

That is why we have actively engaged in the debate around CAP reform and advocated an expanded programme of rural regeneration. We were the first party to call for full decoupling as part of a radical reform of CAP. We believe that the reforms due to take effect as of January 2005 can provide the basis for maintaining family farms if they become part of a revised all-island strategy for the future of Irish agriculture.

We see that future being built on the basis of high quality food production and an expanded domestic processing sector, with a return to genuine producer co-operatives playing an enhanced role. We are also adamant that to preserve the reputation of Irish food, the entire island must remain free from Genetically Modified (GM) crops.

Sinn Féin supports the expansion of the horticultural and organic sector, and will argue for a change in the regulations governing the Single Farm Payment to allow farmers to expand into these areas.

While still a relatively small part of Irish food production, there is a growing demand that can be filled by farmers in this country building on existing resources and our image as the source of clean, nonGM produce to expand higher value-added production for the domestic and export consumer markets.

Rural communities are not just economic units and rural economic life does not all centre on agriculture. Sinn Féin supports a radical decentralisation of the public service and investment in employment opportunities in rural areas.

We support the right of all regardless of region of residence to equal access to public service provision and are opposed to any attempt to cut back on education, health, transport and postal services.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• proper debate and increased national discretion over the regulation of Irish agriculture
• stronger all-Ireland participation in EU agricultural policy formulation, after full input from stakeholders
• entry of new member states into the CAP on an equal basis
• establishment of a full range of complementary rural development programmes to aid farmers and rural communities in adapting to changes brought about by CAP
• adequate provision for farmers who took part in the Early Retirement Scheme
• reassessment of the application of the Nitrates Directive in the light of evidence that nitrate levels in Ireland are currently within the 50 mg limit for water supply and groundwater
• the channelling of all modulated funds from CAP payments towards an expanded programme of rural development
• greater local democratic control of rural development programmes
• the designation of the entire island of Ireland as a GM-free zone
• a new EU embargo on GM products and crops
• increased EU support for expansion of research, development and training in the organic sector

ACTION FOR THE IRISH FISHERIES

Sinn Féin deplores the shameful treatment of the Irish fishing industry under the EU Common Fisheries Policy.

Ever since the scandalous deal that was made on accession in 1973, the Irish fisheries have been subject to greater levels of restrictions. It has reached the stage where the very future of the sector is in doubt.

EU fleets have taken €120 billion in fish out of Irish waters since 1973. That amounts to more than all the direct payments and structural funds to the island. We do not deny the right of fishermen from other countries to fish off our coast but there has to be a fairer proportionality. Irish fishermen have the right to demand a larger share of the quota.

Sinn Féin calls for:
• the radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to include a complete renegotiation of the terms governing the Irish fisheries
• an end to all threats to the Irish Box conservation area
• the statutory representation of fishing organisations in the management of stocks
• the lifting of all EU restrictions on night landings, which are having a detrimental impact on livelihoods and the Irish processing industry
• a programme to sustain coastal communities similar to the rural development aspect of the CAP

TOWARDS A RIGHTS-BASED EU

ELIMINATING POVERTY

People have the right to live free of poverty. As an organised bloc of some of the wealthiest states in the world, the EU has the resources to guarantee this fundamental socio-economic right at least to its own population.

Nevertheless more than 68 million people in the enlarged European Union live in poverty today.

Since its formation, the EU has primarily concerned itself with stimulating economic growth and free market competition in the belief that this was sufficient to eradicate poverty. But the widening poverty gap under the Celtic Tiger economy disproves this theory. Between 1994 and 2000 the number of people living in poverty in the 26 Counties rose to nearly a quarter of the population. In 2004, while the 26 County state is the fourth wealthiest in the world, it has the lowest level of social spending and the highest poverty rate in the EU. In the north, the situation is, if anything, worse. Thirty eight percent of children live in households in poverty.

Job creation and economic growth on their own are not sufficient to tackle poverty. Measuring prosperity in terms of economic growth without taking into account how the wealth created by workers is distributed is a useless exercise. In the EU, the richest 20% of the population receive five times the total income of the bottom 20%.

The increasing numbers of working poor in Ireland and other EU member states are testament to the fact that low-paid, poor quality employment does not necessarily reduce poverty. One fifth of Irish households living in poverty are headed by people who are working but earning low wages and overburdened by the Government’s increasing use of double taxation and stealth charges.

The present situation is unacceptable. Eradicating poverty should be a top EU priority. The needs of the poor and disadvantaged must come before the needs of the wealthy and big business. While we remain committed to the preservation of national sovereignty and independence, we believe that the EU has a coordinating role to play in a genuinely redistributative economic system that has equality and social justice at its core.

As a matter of urgent priority, Sinn Féin MEPs will fight for:
• agreement of EU wide targets and timeframes for poverty reduction and elimination
• agreement of an EU wide target and timeframe for the elimination of homelessness
• poverty-proofing of all EU law and policy
• a renewed Social Exclusion Action Programme that takes into account the needs of the new member states
• an end to EU restrictions on borrowing for investment in capital projects aimed at providing improved public services such as hospitals and schools
• increased protection for public services from privatisation to ensure access to healthcare, education, housing, childcare and eldercare as essential basic rights
• agreed EU minimum standards for social protection and combating poverty and social exclusion
• incorporation of the social and economic rights outlined in the European Social Charter into the body of EU law
• Irish social spending increases to at least the EU average

PROTECTING PUBLIC SERVICES

People have the right of equal access to quality public services, which states have the responsibility to provide and which we pay for through our taxes.

It is wrong to make access to public services such as water, waste collection, health or education dependent on ability to pay or other factors, as so often happens when these services are privatised.

We must not allow the commercial interests of a few set to profit from privatisation of these services to subordinate the meeting of social need in the public interest.

EU restrictions on state formation of or investment in companies has created an environment where rightwing governments can push for privatisation of public services by pointing to the “failure” of public sector companies – whose development has in fact been hampered by EU regulations.

The alleged commitment to a “European Social Model” has failed to prevent a deepening divide between public and private services and this has directly contributed to growing levels of poverty and inequality in Ireland and the EU.

Sinn Féin is committed to maintaining and improving public services. We have repeatedly opposed attempts by various governments to privatise state companies and services. Problems with public services in Ireland are the legacy of decades of under-funding. Spending on health and public transport is still far less than the EU average.

In successive EU Treaty debates Sinn Féin has continually expressed our concern about the threat to public services in the privatisation agenda at the heart of the EU integration process. This privatisation agenda has accelerated under the EU economic policy known as the Lisbon Agenda.

We do not accept that the EU has any right to impose a privatisation agenda on Ireland or on any member state.

Nor do we accept that the EU should have the right to impose methods of raising revenue on sovereign governments. We are opposed to the substitution of regressive “double taxes” in the form of service charges, levies or poll taxes. Progressive taxation is the proper means by which all people contribute to public services proportionately based on their ability to pay.

Sinn Féin MEPs will fight for:
• recognition that equal access to public services is a socio-economic right deserving of protection by the EU
• removal of privatisation imperatives from the Lisbon Agenda at its mid-term review in 2005
• easing of EU restrictions on state involvement in the provision of public services
• transparency and accountability to national parliaments of the Article 133 Committee, which advises and makes proposals to the EU Commission on the negotiation of international trade agreements: member states’ proposals and voting records must be made public
• retention of unanimity in EU decision-making on trade policy in education, health and cultural and audio-visual services (libraries, museums, broadcasting etc.), which the Draft EU Constitution proposes to lift

THE RIGHT TO A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT

Sinn Féin believes that a clean environment is not only a public good but a fundamental social right in need of protection.

Environmental threats transcend borders. Therefore international cooperation is essential in addressing issues of environmental protection.

The European Union has played an important role to date in the promotion of environmental protection objectives. The EU must now show international leadership on climate change prevention, waste management based on a zero waste policy, and development of energy alternatives from non-nuclear renewable sources.

Investment in pollution prevention, environmental health measures and sustainability are essential for the people of Europe today as well as for future generations. Complementary commitments to sustainable development in the EU economic policy known as the Lisbon Agenda have been lost in the stampede to increase competitiveness at all costs. The environmental aspect of the Lisbon Agenda deserves a renewed emphasis.

INVESTMENT IN SUSTAINABILITY

The right to a clean environment can never be protected without EU and national investment in sustainable development.

Sinn Féin MEPs will press for:
• prioritisation of sustainability in EU economic policy
• mainstreaming of sustainable development across all areas of EU law and policy
• full implementation of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy
• increased EU investment in sustainable development, particularly public transport

ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROTECTION

Access to clean air and water are essential for human health. We need concerted action to combat the increasing rate of respiratory illness due to air pollution, and the contamination of our public water supplies and group water schemes which if left unchecked could lead to a public health disaster as seen in other industrial countries in recent times.

Clean air and water supply is a right. Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• timely implementation of all outstanding EU Environmental Directives
• the continual reduction of airborne pollutants and waterborne contaminants including any necessary further EU regulations
• ratification of ILO Convention 174 Concerning the Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents by all the Member States
• pre-eminence for environmental health concerns in the new EU Chemicals Policy (REACH)
• a ban on fluoridation in piped water supplies on the island of Ireland as is best practice in a number of EU states including Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden

FULFILLING OUR KYOTO OBLIGATIONS

Though it was expected that the European Union would show strong leadership in the battle to stop climate change there is growing concern at the lack of progress by member states in the submission of their national emissions targets as required under the EU Emissions Trading Directive. At the time of writing only 5 of 25 states have submitted their plans.

Sinn Féin will continue working for:
• full member state cooperation to establish meaningful emissions targets for industry so that the EU can meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol
• revision of the Irish targets already submitted to strengthen the economic incentives for industry innovation
• no change in the agreed EU time-frame for Kyoto implementation
• increased EU support for technological innovation to improve energy efficiency, with an emphasis on non-nuclear alternatives – Sinn Féin does not accept the EU Commission position that Kyoto implementation dictates increased reliance on carbon-free nuclear energy
• the EU-wide introduction of carbon taxes on industrial energy users to generate behavioural change in favour of lower emitting fuels

TOWARDS A ZERO WASTE STRATEGY

Waste management on this island has been characterised by both inadequacy and environmentally incompatible solutions – bigger landfill sites and more highly dangerous and unpopular incinerators.

This lack of leadership has resulted in an accelerating waste crisis on both sides of the border. Landfill sites are now overflowing. Illegal dumping has become widespread.

Sinn Féin is campaigning for an all-Ireland waste management strategy based on waste reduction, reuse and recycling.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• a Zero Waste Strategy for Ireland and the EU that prioritises the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste
• the setting of targets and timetables for implementing the EU Waste Prevention and Recycling Strategy and EU Sustainable Use of Natural Resources Strategy
• a plan for a progressive phasing-out of landfill sites
• a ban on the use of incinerators at European and national levels
• a review of implementation of the Polluter Pays Principle to refocus more correctly on penalties for industrial and agricultural producers of waste, as opposed to the currently incorrect interpretation which treats the consumer as the primary polluter

TOWARDS A NUCLEAR-FREE EU

Sinn Féin is working towards a nuclear-free Ireland in a nuclear-free EU.

We believe the European Union must lead the move away from nuclear energy and towards the generation of electricity from renewable sources.

We are deeply concerned that after enlargement 13 of 25 member states will have nuclear reactors, but there will be no common set of rules regulating nuclear safety in the EU. This is not acceptable.

Sinn Féin in the European Parliament will campaign for:
• the closure of Sellafield
• an end to the reprocessing of nuclear fuel within the EU
• an end to the promotion of nuclear energy by the EU
• the declaration of Ireland and the EU as Nuclear-Free Zones
• in the interim, an enhanced role for the EU in supporting, supervising and enforcing an EU-wide standard on nuclear safety
• the scrapping of the EURATOM Treaty of 1957 and its replacement with a new agreement on the progressive realisation of a nuclear-free Europe
• no inclusion of EURATOM as a protocol to the new EU Constitutional Treaty
• in the interim, all EURATOM loan applications and decisions to be made public, and subject to a public consultation process
• nuclear disarmament by EU states

CHAMPIONING WORKERS’ RIGHTS

Despite gains made for workers over the lifetime of the EEC/EU, the objective of full employment has not been achieved. Over 50 million people are unemployed in the EU. There are also more than 10 million working poor. This situation must change.

In the rush to increase competitiveness under the EU economic policy, EU workers’ rights are once again under threat. Sinn Féin believes that the European Union must play a greater role in the enhancement of workers’ rights and trade union rights.

We are also deeply concerned about the working conditions of many migrant workers in EU member states including Ireland. The EU must ensure nondiscriminatory work practices and respect for these workers’ human rights.

FULL EMPLOYMENT AND BETTER JOBS

We welcome the EU’s commitment to “more and better jobs” and full employment in a knowledge-based economy. However, we share the concerns of the trade union movement that these objectives have been made subservient to corporate sector demands for labour market “flexibility”.

EU employment policy must address the needs of the working poor to make sure more, better quality, better paid jobs are available to enable all workers to earn a living wage.

Sinn Féin supports an employment policy which can bring about an improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in Ireland and across the EU based on key values such as respect for the dignity of individuals, respect for equality, workplace safety and access to life long learning.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• full employment based on high quality and stable jobs
• a living wage for workers across Ireland and Europe
• the raising of working and living conditions to the highest equal standard across the EU
• the introduction of minimum standards to increase both quality of work and the protection of workers
• positive incentives including training, support and career guidance, rather than forcing people to accept poor quality low paid employment

ENABLING ALL WORKERS TO TAKE UP EMPLOYMENT

People living in poverty as a result of unemployment want to work. However, many of them cannot as a result of poor education, carer responsibilities for children or elderly family members, barriers to access for elderly workers, people with disabilities and asylum seekers, or long-term and generational unemployment.

Enabling all workers to take up employment is the central goal of Sinn Féin employment policy.

In keeping with this, Sinn Féin MEPs will work for EUwide standards on:
• ensuring workers’ access to life-long learning and re-training
• equal access for all to good quality childcare for all
• adaptation of social protection systems to the needs of part-time workers and other atypical workers, including single parents and others caring for dependents, and guaranteed social security rights for atypical workers
• a specific strategy to tackle disproportionately high rates of unemployment among disabled workers, including effective supports for the public and private sector to recruit people with disabilities, effective enforcement mechanisms and remedies regarding the employment quota for the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public sector, and comprehensive needs assessments for people with disabilities to direct them to the appropriate service around their education, training and employment needs
• the right of asylum seekers to work (and pay taxes) while their applications are in process

ENHANCED RIGHTS PROTECTIONS FOR ALL WORKERS

Enhancing workers rights and entitlements will ensure a better quality of life for workers and their families.

Achieving such improvements requires universal recognition of trade unions as the workers’ representatives, and their coordination on an EUwide level.

While the Taoiseach in a reply to Sinn Féin stated that trade union recognition is “not a major item” on the EU agenda, Sinn Féin will not sit back and accept this. Sinn Féin MEPs will fight for:
• mandatory trade union recognition
• upward equalisation of statutory redundancy entitlements across the EU
• increased protection of workers from instability in their jobs as a result of sub-contracting or privatisation
• improved working conditions and health and safety at the workplace including the full implementation of the Community Strategy on Health and Safety 2002-2006
• revision of the EU Working Time Directive to remove the individual opt-out which has had detrimental effects on the health and safety of millions of workers, as well as on their right to a work-life balance
• new working time reduction measures including a 35-hour work week and increased flexibility in working hours
• increased parental protections including the right to paid parental leave and the maintenance of pensions and social security rights during career breaks
• ending gender discrimination and the gender pay gap
• full compliance with the EU Employment Equality Directive to ensure an end to age discrimination in the workplace
• protection for the rights of migrant workers through the adoption of the UN and ILO Conventions on the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families by the European Union and member states
• equal access to social protections for all EU and legal non-EU migrant workers across the EU
• equal rights for temporary workers including passage of the EU Directive on Temporary Agency Workers which would regulate and guarantee equal treatment in employment conditions (this measure is presently being blocked by the Irish and British Governments)

CAMPAIGNING FOR FULL EQUALITY

The European Union is still a very unequal place, where women are grossly underrepresented in decision-making, where people with disabilities are regularly denied full access to education, services and jobs, and where some member state governments still believe it is acceptable to discriminate against people based on their national origin, religion, sexual orientation, family status or age.

Sinn Féin believes that the achievement of full equality of all people within the EU regardless of gender, ethnic origin (including nomadic status), national origin, sexual orientation, disability, religious or political belief, family status, socio-economic status or age, must become a higher priority objective of EU policy. The EU must lead by example on protection from discrimination and the promotion of equality.

Sinn Féin MEPs will make campaigning for equality a priority here at home and in Strasbourg and Brussels. We will work for:
• the introduction of a mechanism for equalityproofing all EU law and policy
• the levelling-up of equality rights protections throughout the EU
• full transposition of the three existing EU Equality Directives into domestic law (the Employment Equality Directive, the Gender Equal Treatment Directive and the Racial Equality Directive), including their application to non-nationals
• the introduction of more comprehensive EU anti-discrimination legislation with similar scope to the Racial Equality Directive, including:
- a new comprehensive Gender Equality Directive
- a new comprehensive Disability Directive
- a new Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgendered Equality Directive

• redress of the persistent democratic deficit caused by the underrepresentation of women on EU decision-making bodies through:
- the introduction of binding gender parity measures in the next EU Treaty
- the appointment of at least 40% women to the next EU Commission
- the appointment of a qualified woman as President of the Commission
- the adoption of similar equal representation measures by the new European Parliament

• implementation of all the demands raised in Sinn Féin’s Women’s Manifesto Women in an Ireland of Equals/Cearta na mBan
• the extension of existing EU legislation to include a specific prohibition on discrimination on the basis of gender identity (transgender), in-line with the ruling of the European Court of Justice
• full recognition in EU law of same-sex partnerships and a revision of the EU Directive on the Free Movement of Citizens and their Families to reflect this recognition
• a revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive to include provision for people with sensory disabilities to guarantee their equal access via provisions such as subtitling, signing, and audiodescription, including an action plan with targets

DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

The European Union must lead by example on the protection and promotion of human, civil and political rights. However the present reality is that 13 of the 15 established member states tolerate domestic human rights violations according to Amnesty International – particularly impunity for excessive force by police, and allowing degrading conditions of detention. Sinn Féin believes that the elimination of human rights abuses within the EU must become a higher priority objective of EU policy.

Present EU policy is fixated on security to the detriment of freedom, justice and rights. This fixation is embodied by the set of draconian measures that make up the so-called EU AntiTerrorism Roadmap (including the common definition of terrorist offences, the EU Arrest Warrant, and the establishment of Joint Investigation Teams).

Sinn Féin opposes present attempts to create an EU security and surveillance state in the name of the socalled “War on Terrorism” because we do not believe that this approach which involves draconian measures will make people or communities in Ireland or the EU any safer.

We believe that security and rights are indivisible and we will challenge the EU securocrat agenda. We will actively oppose the evolving EU surveillance state including such measures as universal mandatory data retention and the introduction of biometric identifiers on passports, visas, and residency permits.

We reject the federalist trend towards incremental integration and centralisation of policing and judicial powers ending in the eventual establishment of EU police, an EU prosecutor, and an EU border guard. We believe that these are matters for sovereign states.

We also reject the accelerating impetus to harmonise criminal law between EU member states, not only on the basis of safeguarding a cornerstone of nation-state sovereignty, but because it is being done without first ensuring the harmonisation of rights protections – which currently vary widely from state to state. Sinn Féin cannot support criminal law harmonisation measures in the absence of equivalent protections.

In addition, the present EU Justice decision-making mechanisms lack democratic accountability.

For these reasons, it continues to be Sinn Féin’s position that EU competence in (jurisdiction over) Justice and Home Affairs should be limited and the unanimity requirement should remain for decisionmaking in this area.

Sinn Féin would however welcome measures that harmonise human rights protections and safeguards between EU member states – just as we support the harmonising upwards between jurisdictions on this island and at a global level. For example, we would favourably consider a Common Migration and Asylum Policy that is fully human rights-compliant, consistent with international law, and based on best practice. Nothing less is acceptable. We oppose any attempts to use this policy to create a “race to the bottom” with regard to migration and asylum law and policy.

In view of our national experience of the positive capacity and potential of immigrants for a society, we oppose the evolution of Fortress Europe-style Common Migration and Asylum Policies for adoption under the Tampere Agenda. Sinn Féin has campaigned against the creation of a Fortress Europe, and will continue to do so.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work for:
• the introduction of human rights-proofing of all EU law and policy
• the establishment of an EU Human Rights Agency
• incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into the next EU Treaty, including full enforceability
• domestic amending legislation to allow for proper full incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law in the 26 Counties
• an end to the blockage at Council of the proposed Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia
• Common Migration and Asylum Policies that are fully compliant with human rights instruments, that bring rights protections up to the highest standard, and that make the EU more open, inclusive and anti-racist
• Scrapping of the so-called EU Anti-Terrorism Roadmap and related measures and their replacement with a human rights-compliant strategy based on a “human security” approach that is, one that seeks to prevent and resolve conflict by recognising and resolving the root causes of conflict
• development of an EU framework on corporate accountability with a strong human rights dimension 
• Sinn Féin MEPs will also keep a close “subsidiarity watch” on all measures proposing EU criminal law, policing, border control or judicial harmonisation.

PROMOTING IRISH LANGUAGE RIGHTS

Sinn Féin will ensure that all Irish speaking people can use the language in their dealings with domestic and European institutions as of right.

Domestically, Sinn Féin recognises the importance of the Official Languages Act, 2003 and the appointment of the first Languages Commissioner. For too long Irish speaking citizens denied public services through Irish had no alternative to expensive and time-consuming litigation in the High Court. The Official Languages Act now provides a much-needed mechanism for Irish speakers in the 26 Counties to ensure their rights are respected by the state.

Irish speakers in the Six Counties are in need of equal legal protection. We have therefore called on the British Government to enact an Irish Language Act along the lines of the Welsh Language Act, 1993 and the Official Languages Act, 2003 as a matter of urgency.

We are also committed to the achievement of official working status for the Irish language in the European Union. We have long recognised that the State made a fundamental error when joining the EEC in 1973 by not accepting official status for the language which was offered to the Irish Government at that time.

The Irish Government’s attitude contrasts with the national confidence of the new member states, who insisted on immediate recognition of Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Slovene and Maltese as official EU working languages when they joined on 01 May 2004.

Malta is a bilingual nation like Ireland. EU laws and official documents will now be translated into Maltese but not into Irish – despite the fact that EU law has been directly enforceable in Ireland since 1973. While knowledge of Maltese will now allow EU job applicants to meet the bilingualism requirement, knowledge of Irish will not.

Sinn Féin congratulates the STÁDAS Campaign for raising this issue across the 32 Counties during the Irish Presidency of the EU.

In keeping with the demands for equal status for the Irish language in the EU Sinn Féin MEPs will:
• continue to work with the STÁDAS Campaign and others for the recognition of Irish as an official working language of the EU
• address the European Parliament in Irish on a regular basis
• make it clear that we are strong supporters of the EU principles of multiculturalism and multilingualism

FOR AN INDEPENDENT IRELAND IN A GLOBALLY RESPONSIBLE EU

INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY AND GLOBAL SOCIAL JUSTICE

Sinn Féin believes that EU member states should work cooperatively through the EU to exercise global responsibility in economic relations. As the biggest aid donor and trade partner of developing nations, the EU has the potential to play a very significant role in advancing human security (freedom from poverty, disease, and human rights violations) and global social justice through the way in which it conducts its aid and trade relationships.

However, Sinn Féin does not accept that there is any need for a EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) nor do we accept the legitimacy of establishing an EU Common Defence. We do not accept EU exclusive competence in this area as it undermines a cornerstone of state sovereignty. We believe that international relations – and international justice and peace in particular – are best served by the efforts of sovereign states acting in concert through the only fully inclusive multilateral forum, the United Nations.

We also oppose the present federalist drive to fully integrate foreign and defence policy among EU member states because it threatens to create a new military alliance that enjoys a special relationship with the military alliance representing the most powerful states on the planet: NATO.

Sinn Féin will continue to campaign for the restoration of an independent Irish foreign policy. In the interim we will adamantly oppose any erosion of the unanimity requirement in Council decision-making on CFSP.

We will also continue to campaign for the EU to adopt a Global Social Justice Agenda as an equivalent priority to the Lisbon Agenda, with an emphasis on achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, Trade Justice, and UN reform.

ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals on global poverty reduction by 2015 must become the single overriding objective for EU external relations

policy, as this is the most effective way of ensuring human and global security. At minimum, the EU partners must meet the modest Barcelona Commitments on implementation of the Goals.

Sinn Féin MEPs will work towards:
• bringing the EU partners on board to match the Irish Government’s commitment to Developing Country Debt Cancellation – with an urgent priority on debt cancellation for countries with a high HIV/AIDS prevalence
• establishment of permanent EU monitoring group to review members’ implementation of the Monterey and Barcelona Commitments on aid increases, aid harmonisation, the untying of aid, and an increased proportion of EU aid to poor countries
• a reversal of the present imbalance in EU military v. development aid spending, and a redirection of a significant portion of the €160 billion presently spent annually by EU states on defence towards the estimated €100 billion cost of cutting global poverty in half by 2015
• the 26 Counties to return to multi-annual Official Development Aid (ODA) budgeting, and publish a plan for incremental growth in ODA between 2004-2007 as recommended by Development Cooperation Ireland and Dóchas
• reform of the International Financial System to strengthen representation of developing countries in international economic decision making
• the establishment of Ireland and the EU as Currency Speculation (Tobin) Tax Zones

TRADE JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS

It is not acceptable for the EU to act as an economic superpower, imposing a free trade agenda that hurts the developing world. Instead it must use its considerable economic power responsibly by pursuing policies that eradicate the exploitative trade relationships that prevent the developing world from establishing independent sustainable economies.

The EU must also ensure that it does not contribute directly or indirectly to human rights violations in other parts of the world and indeed, to use its economic leverage to ensure human rights compliance.

Sinn Féin MEPs will campaign for:

The draft Article 40 enabling provisions direct that:
• human rights-proofing of all EU aid and trade policies
• the adoption of a Trade Justice approach at EU level, to allow fair trade to prevail over completely unrestricted free trade
• coherence between Ireland’s and the EU’s aid and trade policies
• the resumption of the Doha Development Round at the WTO, and the speedy resolution of the outstanding development-related issues before the introdcution of any other issues
• the activation of Articles 2 and 79 of the EU Association Agreement with Israel allowing for the suspension of preferential trade on the basis of human rights violations, until such time as Israel ceases assassinations of Palestinian leaders, collective punishments, and construction of the illegal Apartheid Wall, and returns to the table for peace negotiations without preconditions
• a more effective EU Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers and the adoption of an international Arms Trade Treaty to prevent EU export of arms where they contribute to violations of human rights
• adoption of the proposed EU Regulation on Trade in Torture Equipment
• the development of a European Framework on Corporate Social Responsibility

PROMOTING IRISH NEUTRALITY, EU DEMILITARISATION, AND UN REFORM

Successive EU treaties since the Single European Act in 1987 have corroded independent foreign policy to the point where Irish military neutrality is virtually all we have left.

But Irish neutrality is now under pressure from the accelerating militarisation of the EU, underway in earnest since the first reference to EU military cooperation and Common Defence appeared in the Maastricht Treaty. Subsequent treaties have built incrementally on this. The Amsterdam Treaty established the European Security and Defence Policy and the Rapid Reaction Force . The Nice Treaty created command and control structures in which Ireland participates, including an EU Military Command. Now we are confronted with the EU federalist drive to use the next Treaty to reconstruct the EU as a military and economic superpower.

Despite all the denials, an EU Army is evolving, and the Constitutional Treaty under negotiation will bring us measurably closer to this.
• the EU shall frame a Common Defence Policy leading to a Common Defence
• Common Defence can be the subject of “enhanced cooperation”, or the subcontracting of defence to a smaller group of states
• members shall contribute forces and improve military capabilities, and that the EU shall establish an EU Armaments Agency (the basis for an EU military industrial complex)
• members shall be required to defend other members in case of attack and to cooperate with NATO in this

Many of these next generation developments are already underway, Treaty or no Treaty, as they are being pursued by agreement in the EU Council. For example, while we don’t yet have a new Treaty, we do have:
• an EU military harmonisation deadline of 2010 and an agreement to establish the EU Armaments Agency
• an agreed EU Security Doctrine that includes imperatives to increase military spending and an extension of the EU Rapid Reaction Force’s Petersburg Tasks well beyond humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks to include military intervention to assist other states both within and outside the EU in counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency operations
• an EU-approved enhanced cooperation agreement on defence between the biggest, most powerful states France, Germany, and Britain

The need for intervention to halt the momentum of EU militarisation has never been more urgent. Yet the Irish Government on behalf of a supposedly neutral state has done nothing to oppose these developments, and has done even less to improve its negotiating position for the future in an EU that continues to be even more heavily dominated by NATO states after enlargement in May 2004.

Worse, the Irish Government has continued to violate its own stated policy of neutrality by allowing Shannon airport to be used as a refuelling base by thousands of US troops on their way to the illegal occupation of Iraq.

Sinn Féin proposes an independent and progressive Irish international relations policy that opposes military alliances and works for international cooperation and conflict negotiation leading to democratic social change and respect for human rights, universal demilitarisation and nuclear disarmament.

Sinn Féin MEPs will strongly promote our policy of “Positive Neutrality in Action”, which requires:
• neutrality to be enshrined in the Irish Constitution and codified in legislation
• withdrawal from the EU Rapid Reaction Force and NATO's Partnership for Peace
• Irish troops to train and serve abroad only under the auspices and leadership of the United Nations, and only with prior Dáil approval
• no use of Irish airports, airspace, seaports, or territorial waters for preparation for war or other armed conflict by foreign powers
• an end to Irish involvement in the arms trade and profit from war
• clear recognition and legal protection through a binding Protocol on Irish neutrality in any new EU Treaty, and explicit parity of esteem for the EU neutral states
• active promotion of demilitarisation of the EU, including nuclear disarmament
• formation of alliances with other progressive, neutral states to promote a Human Security approach to international relations
• active promotion of UN primacy, as well as badly needed UN reform and capacity-building to create a revitalised UN which is capable of fulfilling the promise of the Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and of upholding international law

A vote for Sinn Féin is a vote to endorse this approach to international relations and a vote in favour of the demilitarisation of the EU.
",2004,"EP","Sinn Fein","Sinn Fein_2004_EP"
"Local 2004: Fine Gael","In this Local Election Manifesto, Fine Gael sets out ideas on how politics can really work for people: in their homes, in their communities, where they work, whether it’s in the heart of the city or of the country.

Irish society is changing, subtly but certainly. The ‘selfishness’ of the last ten years is being replaced by a desire to belong, to feel part of a community. Today, people want Government that cares about the reality of the lives they are living, for example, how the cost of living is soaring, how tough it is being marooned in estates miles from work, schools and public transport, their worries about health care, their rising concern about childcare when two salaries are needed to pay the mortgage, the question of respect and security in old age, the need to feel safe in their neighbourhood and on the streets.

This manifesto contains ways to address all of these and make life better, more rewarding and secure. It shows what can be achieved by proper planning, when politics has a vision for the future and a desire to care and work for the people and not, first and foremost, for ‘the Party’.

It’s less than three years to the next General Election. But at that election, people won’t just be choosing between candidates, or parties, or leaders, they will be making up their minds on something infinitely more important: the kind of Ireland they want to live in. An Ireland where the people come first, led by Fine Gael? Or an Ireland where ‘the Party’ comes first, led by Fianna Fail and the PDs? That’s the choice.

But the process of choosing starts much earlier: on 11th June next. The Local Elections are the first opportunity for people to show their rejection of a Government incapable of keeping its word, that taxes them by stealth, that has made no-go areas of town and cities, that plans to close down vital A&E facilities and replace them with ambulance traffic.

It’s time for change. Fine Gael wants to lead that change and create a better, more equal, caring Ireland. It’s time to give people a reason to hope, believe and trust again in politics and politicians. If we don’t, we are failing them, because if we allow people to drift away from politics, we are denying them their democratic right to share in the decisions that affect their lives.

Fine Gael will put the people first, because we seek to govern not to rule, but to serve. We have over 740 candidates who will abide by those principles to create a better, more honourable and caring Ireland. So, let’s see what we can achieve, as a nation, when we work together for a higher good that all of us can share in – investors, entrepreneurs, taxpayers, parents, pensioners and volunteers alike.

“It’s time for change. Fine Gael wants to lead that change and create a better, more equal, caring Ireland. It’s time to give people a reason to hope, believe and trust again in politics and politicians.”

INTRODUCTION BY BERNARD ALLEN TD

Following seven years of Fianna Fail/PD rule, our local communities are in need of radical solutions to real problems.

This manifesto outlines Fine Gael’s proposals for dealing with problems that are damaging communities- problems like access to housing, high rates of crime, the rip-off culture, traffic, planning and access to services.

The key highlights of this manifesto are;
• A special package for first time house buyers. An SSIA type scheme to help them save, abolition of stamp duty on second-hand homes bought by first-time buyers and a frontloading of mortgage interest relief to help them in the early years of mortgage repayments.
• Measures to tackle the scandal of unfinished housing estates.
• A Consumer Rights Enforcer to tackle rip-off Ireland with powers being devolved to Local Authorities to name and shame local rip-offs.
• Outlawing the rip-off practices of gazumping and staged payments.
• Extra resources to the Gardaí. Tackling violent crime will be a key priority. A dedicated Organised Crime Unit within the Gardaí should be established.
• A Home Detention Curfew Scheme and electronic tagging should be used to tackle juvenile offenders in a cost effective way.
• Through the creation of Local Crime Prevention Councils, we would create an entirely new overseer role for the Local Authority, dedicated to security and policing matters in their own local authority area.
• Fine Gael will also introduce Civic Wardens to supplement and support the work of the Gardaí. We want to consult with well-established and valued voluntary and community organisations such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch in establishing the Service.
• Fine Gael is opposed to the closure of vital A&E services in local hospitals. Fine Gael believes that a hospital is not a hospital unless it has a doctor on-site 24 hours a day. We are committed to ensuring that at a minimum every hospital has such a service.
• An Independent Commission on Rural Housing to recommend changes to the law if necessary, as well as developing feasible policy measures to address this complex issue.
• We will establish a Rezoning Review Board, headed by a High Court judge, to scrutinise every rezoning decision made at Council level to ensure the decision is sensible and is in the public good.
• Fine Gael believes that the concept of directly elected mayors should be piloted in the country’s major cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.
• Fine Gael will establish a new Dublin Transport Authority to take over the existing powers from the 20 separate groups/agencies that currently have some responsibility for transport. All public transport bodies would be answerable to the DTA for the service they provide.

1. Tackling the Housing Crisis

Issue:

Since Fianna Fail and the PDs took power, the price of a home has tripled. The average price for a house in Dublin is now €314,000. Outside Dublin, the average price is €208,000. As a result, homeownership has become impossible for many young people who find getting on the property ladder too expensive.

Added to this, is an ever-growing waiting list for local authority housing. Over 100,000 individuals are waiting in the queue for social housing for themselves and their families.

Instead of tackling the housing crisis, the Government has reaped a taxation windfall from the surge in the price of new homes. The Government takes approximately 45% of the cost of every new house in taxation. In 2003, the Government netted over €5 billion from taxation on new homes.

Stance:

Fine Gael believes that a range of measures are required to address the “affordability gap” which prevents people who have incomes buying their own homes. We also need innovative ways of tackling supply and demand issues.

Proposals:

For First Time Buyers
• A House Deposit Savings Scheme, similar to the SSIA scheme to help young people who are saving for a deposit for a new home. Under the scheme, first time buyers will receive €1 for every €3 they save provided those savings are used for a deposit on a house. No tax on interest will apply. The recipient must show regular monthly savings for a minimum of 2 years. The scheme will operate for both new and secondhand houses
• Abolish stamp duty on second-hand homes up to €400,000 bought by first time buyers. This will mean that a first time buyer purchasing a second-hand home which cost €325,000 would save €14,625
• Frontload mortgage interest relief for first time buyers to the first seven years of the life of a mortgage, thereby giving first time buyers the help when they most need it.

To Ease Demand and Increase Supply
• Reform the social welfare code that currently forces young people out of the family home, adding upward pressure on house rents and prices. The income of parents should no longer be taken into account when deciding on the welfare entitlements of those who remain at home.
• Refocus tax incentives for developers by providing incentives for the voluntary sector and those who intend to build sheltered housing for the elderly.
• Refocus tax incentives for house buyers by offering elderly people who wish to ‘trade down’ incentives to do so, thus freeing up under-utilised accommodation.
• An urgent investigation by the Competition Authority into reports of building land hoarding in the Greater Dublin area and an investigation into house price increases, which increased in excess of 10% in the year ended 30th June 2003. Building materials only increased in that period by 0.6%.

To Help Rural Ireland
• An Independent Commission on Rural Housing must be given the power to recommend changes to the law if necessary, as well as developing feasible policy measures to address this complex issue. The Government’s recently issued ‘guidelines’ on one-off rural housing mean nothing and will not result in any tangible change in rural housing policy.
• The Commission will examine all issues surrounding rural housing including:
• Existing planning practice
• Waste management implications
• Infrastructure requirements All interest groups must be represented and the Commission should be asked to report within six months.

Towards a Better Housing Policy
• A National Housing Agency. It is envisaged that the existing Housing Finance Agency will be expanded and strengthened to take on a new role in assisting Local Authorities meet housing targets. The new body will be accountable to the relevant Dáil Committee.

Functions:
(i) Monitoring of County Development Plans to ensure consistency with the Strategic Planning Guidelines and the National Development Plan investment programme
(ii) Liaising with other State Agencies so that transport, educational and recreational needs can be planned in tandem with accommodation provision.
(iii) Driving the servicing of lands identified for housing by Local Authorities. This may involve direct management of provision of water and drainage facilities where the lack of expertise or manpower by individual Local Authorities is inhibiting the supply of housing.
(iv) At the request of the Local Authorities concerned the Agency could also take responsibility for coordinating land servicing across Local Authority boundaries where joint schemes are more appropriate and cost efficient.

• All Housing Authorities must give an account of the action they have taken to implement the provisions of the Traveller Accommodation Act and, where Local Authorities have failed, the legislation should be modified to enable the Government to enforce compliance.

Tackling Homelessness
• A fully integrated homelessness policy should be adopted to tackle homelessness. This should include measures preventing people becoming homeless, as well as provision for those who are already without a home. Fine Gael opposes the Government’s ‘Six Month Rule’ on rent supplements and all the other welfare cuts that will help drive more people further into poverty and homelessness.

Housing for People with Disabilities
• The Disabled Persons Housing Grant Scheme (DPG) is characterised by long waiting lists, unacceptable waiting times, lack of adequate resources and arbitrary application. According to the Disability Federation Of Ireland Local Authorities now operate different eligibility and application procedures and pay different amounts. The result of these reviews is that people with disabilities are being left in hospital contributing to waiting lists, housed inappropriately in nursing homes, going on to housing lists and living in inaccessible, unsuitable and potentially dangerous homes. This causes immeasurable strain for the individuals concerned and their families.

We propose that Local Authorities increase the DPG to cover 100% of the actual cost of the approved building work in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Individual local authority review measures should be scrapped and a national standardised process developed. We also propose that each Local Authority house should have a bathroom, toilet and central heating provided.

Homeownership has become impossible for many young people who find getting on the property ladder too expensive.

2. Tackling Crime
Issue:
• Since this Government has been in office there has been an enormous increase in crime rates. Headline offences have increased by 20,000. This figure may float up and down by a percentage or two but the big picture remains the same. This Government has failed to tackle serious crime.
• Detection rates for headline offences fell from 41% in 2001 to 39% in 2002. Fine Gael/MRBI research revealed that 1 in 5 crimes are not reported.

In their Programme for Government, both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised 2,000 extra Gardaí. Yet two years later, there is no sign of even one of these extra Gardaí on the beat.

Due to manpower and resource issues, the Gardai are increasingly fighting rearguard actions in large urban areas where social disadvantage and organised crime are on the increase. In some areas, a rift has developed in the relationship between the public and the Garda Siochana. Although the Gardaí still enjoy the support of a majority of citizens, people are increasingly disappointed with their dealings with the force.

Stance:
Cutting crime needs to be addressed at a number of levels. Garda resources must be increased and structures improved, whilst innovative ways of involving the community must also be developed.

Proposals:

Tackling Serious Crime
• A dedicated Organised Crime Unit within the Gardaí should be established.
• Fine Gael will provide extra resources to the Gardaí. Tackling violent crime will be a key priority.
• The Government must urgently address the rising number of gangland killings. Witness intimidation is a sinister factor, which has hampered the effectiveness of investigations into gang related crime. All evidence in gang related investigations should be videotaped. This will deal with witnesses who may later succumb to memory loss or intimidation. This evidence could be used in a court of law if the witness refused to support his original statement. A provision should be made to allow the swearing in of witnesses in other jurisdictions and evidence to be given by video link when a witness is unwilling to travel from abroad due to fear of violent consequences.

Tackling Public Order Offences
• A Home Detention Curfew Scheme and electronic tagging should be used to tackle juvenile offenders in a cost effective way.
• Fine Gael recognises that the increasing levels of alcohol-fuelled crime requires radical action.
• We propose to introduce electronic tagging initially for juvenile offenders and also sex offenders on release.

There are significant advantages in adopting such a measure:
• It is a cost effective way of dealing with certain crimes. At a cost of approximately €4,000 per offender, tagging costs a small fraction of the cost of sending a person to jail.
• Tagging will relieve the kind of pressure on prisons that gives rise to early release of offenders. This would ultimately ensure that prison places are available for serious offenders and will ensure that they serve their full sentences.
• Tagging increases the possibility of improving rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.
• Electronic monitoring may enable more offenders to maintain employment and contact with their families.

The most compelling argument to support the use of tagging is that of the 67,000 prisoners released under the system since it was introduced in the UK in 1999 – less than 3% have re-offended.

Fine Gael supports a total ban on all alcohol advertising, sponsorship and promotion. We will insist on installation of CCTV cameras inside and outside all nightclubs.

Crime Prevention Councils
• Fine Gael proposes that Local Authorities should coordinate an integrated approach to all issues involved in policing, crime prevention and all relevant social matters. Through the creation of Local Crime Prevention Councils, we would create an entirely new overseer role for the Local Authority.
• These councils will be established on a statutory basis and would compel senior Gardaí and other agencies to attend these public meetings. The goal would be to provide for interaction and restore a sense of cooperation and ownership to a public who has become disconnected with our criminal justice system. It would also allow the Gardaí and other groups to challenge Government on issues of relevance to them.
• Through their local elected representatives, the people will link directly to the Gardaí in their locality, encouraging community participation and helping to find the best ways to beat crime.

Community Policing
• Fine Gael will also introduce Civic Wardens to supplement and support the work of the Gardaí. The scheme would be based on the programme introduced by the Dutch Government which subsidised the recruitment of ""social caretakers"" to exercise functional surveillance in certain high-risk neighbourhoods.
• We want to consult with well-established and valued voluntary and community organisations such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch in establishing the Service. Suitable training should be provided and widespread consultation should be initiated with the Gardaí and local community groups prior to the launch of the scheme.
• In rural areas, the Wardens could regularly check on elderly people living alone who might be at risk from criminals. We believe it should be possible with suitable training to utilise the Community Employment Programme as the vehicle to employ these wardens.

Estate Management
• A crackdown on anti-social behaviour through a review of estate management arrangements will be undertaken by every Local Authority to protect responsible citizens from the recklessness of others.

3. Tackling Rip-Off Ireland

Issue:
Ireland, once one of the cheapest countries in the European Union, has become one of the most expensive places in the world to live. From the price of a home to the price of a hi-fi, Irish consumers are being ripped off every day. High prices are bad for everyone- bad for businesses whose costs are continually being driven up and bad for consumers who find their budget is stretched further and further.

Stance:
Fine Gael at national level has led a campaign to highlight Rip-off Ireland, particularly through our website ripoff.ie. Fine Gael believes that Local Authorities have a role to play in tackling the rip off culture. Local monopolies and cartels have emerged so even if consumers shop around they are faced with uniformly high prices in their locality.

Proposals:

Fine Gael proposes that a new Consumer Rights Enforcer be established who will:
• Conduct regular price surveys that highlight good value and name and shame those charging excessive prices.
• Create a price league website with tables on all major products.
• Develop codes of conduct for service providers and retailers on issues like passing on exchange rate movements.
• Devise and promote a Good Practice Provider quality mark for suppliers of goods and services that agree to be bound by relevant codes of practice.
• Impose fines for non display of price lists in petrol stations, pubs, hairdressers and restaurants up to a maximum of €3,000, from the current level of €127.
• Represent the consumer in national partnership agreements. It is clear that recent agreements have been dominated by the producers with consumers being given little thought.
• The Enforcer will empower Officers of Local Authorities with similar functions at local level. This will involve Local Authorities in carrying out regular local price surveys and sporadic investigations, as well as “name and shame” publicity campaigns to highlight blatant high margins on certain products.
• End rip-off practices in housing.
• Fine Gael will introduce legislation to prevent gazumping which can leave housebuyers significantly out of pocket in terms of legal fees and surveys, not to mention losing a house unfairly after a deal has been agreed.
• Many consumers throughout Ireland are being ripped-off when they buy new homes on an estate, with the builder insisting that up to 90% of the cost is paid before the house is handed over. The only party which benefits from staged payments is the builder. The consumer, however, could face financial ruin if the builder becomes bankrupt during the transaction. Fine Gael has already published a Bill to end staged payments, and the Party is demanding that they be made illegal.
• The cost of insurance to Irish consumers has more than trebled in the last three years. Young motorists are being driven off the road. Small businesses are threatened with closure because of soaring public liability insurance costs. Fine Gael is committed to the creation of one insurance market for all of Europe, thus fostering competition and driving insurance costs down.

Irish consumers are being ripped off every day. High prices are bad for everyone - bad for businesses and bad for consumers.

4. Reducing Traffic Gridlock

Issue:

Ireland’s cities and towns are struggling to deal with the traffic volumes that pass through their streets every day. Increasingly, at peak times, the main arteries into urban areas resemble car parks as commuters try to get to and from work.

The effects of this traffic chaos can be felt everywhere. The quality of people’s lives is significantly affected when they are forced to spend less time with their families and more time in their cars. Traffic gridlock is costing businesses millions. For many, there is simply no alternative to private cars.

Stance:

Ireland’s transport policies have been damned for years by short term planning, poor co-ordination and insufficient investment.

Park and Ride
• We propose the introduction of park-and-ride facilities at strategic locations where the national road network meets the public transport network, especially at rail stations and adjacent to Quality Bus Corridors. We also pledge to extend all QBCs in all urban areas. QBCs will encourage commuters to leave their cars outside city and town centres, thus reducing traffic volume and making cities and towns better places to live and work.
• Funded by the revenue generated from parking fees, Local Authorities will be charged with ensuring that park and ride facilities are properly maintained, advertised and signposted, as well as ensuring that proper access to the site is provided for in the planning stages.
• With the establishment of more park and ride facilities, demand for quality bus corridors will grow. We also expect an increase in the need for reliable, quality suburban rail services. In the short to medium term, Fine Gael sees these areas as the priority for public transport improvements throughout the country.

Better Public Transport - More Competition
• Access to the provision of bus services for reward should be opened up to private enterprise subject to suitable licensing and quality arrangements.
• Local Authorities are best placed to decide on the licensing of local bus routes, as they can properly assess consumer demand on ground level. Therefore, we recommend that powers to license local bus routes should be transferred to councils.

Dublin Transport
• Fine Gael will establish a new Dublin Transport Authority to take over the existing powers from the 20 separate groups/agencies that currently have some responsibility for transport. All public transport bodies would be answerable to the DTA for the service they provide.

An End to Roadworks Chaos
• The investment of scarce resources in the development of roads and footpaths is often reversed by service providers digging up those same roads and footpaths within a short time.
• Local Authorities must:
• Enforce the necessary regulations to ensure that public utilities (water service providers, telecommunication companies, energy supply companies are obliged to put all services underground in urban areas and in any other areas designated by the competent Planning Authorities.
• Give notice of all schedules of routine installation and maintenance work and of planned development work. This will mean that the competent Planning Authorities can ensure co-ordination of the necessary work with the minimum inconvenience to the public.
• Carry out all surface restoration work to acceptably high standards to ensure the harmony of the streetscape and to avoid danger to the public.
• Enforcement of planning laws by the Local Authorities is poor and the lax enforcement of planning conditions is common place. Therefore, Local Authorities need more and better qualified personnel to monitor the enforcement of planning conditions and a new cultural commitment to excellence must be implanted and nurtured among Local Authority staff.

Rail
• Fine Gael is committed to investing in commuter rail services, not just in the Greater Dublin area but also in regions of the country where there are under-utilised rail facilities, eg the Western Rail Corridor.

Country Roads
• Fine Gael believes that we need to seriously address the state of county roads which are in a deplorable condition in many parts of the country. Some communities are in danger of losing essential services like school bus transport and business deliveries because local roads are in such an appalling condition.
• The County Roads Refurbishment Programme has not been implemented adequately to deal with the extent of the problem and must be done so immediately.

5. Reforming Local Government

Issue:
With falling voter turnout and irrefutable evidence that people are becoming apathetic towards local politics, Fine Gael believes it is time to totally change the way Local Authorities do their work.
At worst, Local Authorities are seen as bloated, inefficient and irrelevant to the lives of people.
It doesn’t have to be this way.

Stance:
Local Government has the potential to thrive. Real local democracy, driven by the need for first class services in everything from bin collection to tax collection, can be an engine for change and improve the everyday lives of Irish people in a tangible way.

Proposals:
Directly Elected Mayors and Local Ministers for major cities
• Fine Gael believes that the concept of directly elected mayors should be piloted in the country’s major cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.
• A Mayor would be elected for a five year term by popular vote under the PR-STV system. Upon his or her election, a Local Cabinet would be selected from councillors from either one single party or a coalition representing the majority on the council.
• Each member of the Local Cabinet will act as a ‘local minister’ with a portfolio for which they will take executive decisions. The Mayor would be the political leader of the community, proposing policy for approval by the Council and spearheading cross-portfolio initiatives as well as initiatives in co-operation with other local authorities.
• If the directly elected Mayor is from a different Party than that from which the Local Cabinet is drawn, a system of ‘cohabitation’ would be established, similar to that which works in France at national level.
• Under this model, a Chief Executive will replace existing City or County Officers, Executive Officers will replace Directors of Services. Chief Executives and Executive Officers will be appointed by the full council and will be directly answerable to the elected Mayor.

Improved Structures
• The Local Government Act 2001 allows a town or specific area to apply for its own Local Government system and to establish a town or area council. Many large towns like Tallaght will apply for this status.
• Left unchanged, the larger ‘breakaway’ towns will remove a huge chunk of the tax base from existing county councils and the levels of bureaucracy will increase.

Real local democracy can be an engine for change and improve the everyday lives of Irish people in a tangible way.

6. Building Better Communities

Issue:
• Fine Gael proposes that to avoid this, each county should be divided into district councils, each of which remains within the county council framework. This will avoid a splintering of local authorities and ensure that large tracts of rural Ireland are not left without an urban tax base to support them.
• These districts should be drawn along existing natural lines and with the consent of the local communities.

Such a situation will also allow for real local democracy by bringing decision making procedures closer to the people.
• Once this has been done, Fine Gael will examine the multiplicity of Local Government agencies to see if they are really necessary we will incorporate many of these bodies into the existing local government structure, thus reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency and providing local taxpayers with better value for money.

Efficiency and Value for Money
• Services provided by Local Authorities should involve personal face to face contact between the public and officials. Privacy, courtesy and the identification of the official concerned must become the norms in such contacts. There must be a Local Government Citizens Charter which will set out clearly
• The rights of the citizen in all dealings with Local Government;
• The duties and functions of the Local Authority;
• The obligations of the Local Authority to each citizen in its functional area;
• Standards and services to be guaranteed in the system.
• Fine Gael proposes that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will annually collate and publish data, in league table format, of how each council is performing in a wide range of services. Public scrutiny, and pressure from the local communities that they are elected and paid to serve, will ensure that local authorities don’t waste money and that they provide the services people deserve.

Across the country housing estates are being built with no social infrastructure to enable the development of a sense of community. No playgrounds or parks; no schools for miles; no community halls. People are marooned in these concrete jungles with no heart in which to build a community. It’s time for something better.

Stance:

Fine Gael believes in the importance of having vibrant and sustainable residential communities. Fine Gael wants to ensure that people can feel safe where they live, go to school where they live, play sport where they live. We will promote world-class standards for the planning of residential communities and implement these standards at development stage.

Proposals:
• Fine Gael proposes to tackle the scandal of unfinished housing estates by strengthening the enforcement role of Local Authorities. Local Councils are currently hampered by a lack of personnel and resources. Fine Gael will bring forward proposals to ensure that all legal transactions between purchasers and developers include a clause whereby a portion of the price of a house is placed in trust until all elements of the development are complete.
• Fine Gael proposes the implementation of a ban on future planning permission being granted to those developers who have failed to fully comply with previous planning permissions.
• Fine Gael proposes a crackdown on anti-social behaviour through a review of estate management arrangements to be undertaken by every Local Authority to protect responsible citizens from the recklessness of others.
• Fine Gael proposes the establishment of a Built Environment Institute.
• The Institute would bring together architects, planners, sociologists, engineers, economists etc.
• The Institute should take over the work of the Building Regulations Advisory Board and will also commission research and draft guidelines on improved architectural and environmental standards for building and urban design in Ireland and in particular on the improved planning and development of residential communities.
• As part of their Housing Strategy, Fine Gael proposes that all local authorities shall be required (in partnership with the Built Environment Institute) to prepare a Charter for Development of Residential Communities.
• This charter will lay down minimum standards of architecture & urban design for new residential developments as well as guiding the provision of community facilities and social infrastructure for new or expanding residential communities.
• Fine Gael propose that developers of residential communities shall be required to provide social infrastructure for that community, including the provision of green areas, playgrounds, playing fields, community halls etc.
• Provision of social infrastructure could be achieved either in partnership with the Local Authority or directly by the developer who should be permitted to offset the relevant financial contribution against the cost of development levies applicable to that residential development.
• The proposed new National Housing Agency & Built Environment Institute would liase with Local Authorities so as to ensure that transport, educational and recreational needs can be planned and met in tandem with local accommodation provision
• Furthermore Local Authorities would be required to work with the National Housing Agency to prepare an annual report identifying residential communities that do not have adequate local access in terms of their population to schools, social services or sporting/cultural amenities.

7. Better Planning

Issue:
Economic development, increasing urbanisation and population increases have placed enormous pressures on our planning system. The planning system must be adapted to meet with these pressures in an effective way. It must also be free from the corrupt practices which have been revealed at the Planning Tribunal.

Stance:
Fine Gael believes that the planning system must be reformed so that there is greater accountability and responsiveness to the needs of a developing society.

Proposals:
Accountability
• The elected members of Local Authorities must have a far greater input into the planning process but, at the same time, be democratically accountable.
• In addition to having powers in relation to the adoption of County Development Plans, Councillors must be given the powers to draw up the regulations and guidelines necessary to implement the provisions of development plans;
• Planning decisions of certain types or over a certain threshold should be submitted for finalisation to elected members of the Planning Authority. Such decisions could include, for example, housing developments of over 50 dwelling units, retail developments over a certain size, industrial activities requiring an EPA licence and major infrastructure projects (including all National Road Authority projects).
• Fine Gael believes that any planning decision which departs from the recommendations made by technical and planning staff should be fully explained and justified to the elected members of the Planning Authority and to the public.

An Bord Pleanala
• An Bord Pleanala has proved incapable of dealing with appeals coming before it within the target maximum period. We believe that period should be reduced even further. It is clear that further resources are needed to prevent appeals from becoming an unnecessary delay in the planning and development process.
• In cases where An Bord Pleanala makes a decision that goes against the advice of its own technical advisors, the motivation of that decision should be fully explained to all interested parties and to the public. Independence does not eliminate accountability.

Rezoning Review Board
• In tandem with this approach, Fine Gael believes in the need for reform in the way rezoning decisions are made so that corruption can no longer be allowed to flourish.
• We believe that a Rezoning Review Board, headed by a High Court judge, should be established that would see every rezoning decision made at Council level scrutinised to ensure the decision is sensible and is in the public good.

Fine Gael wants to ensure that people can feel safe where they live, go to school where they live, play sport where they live.

8. Waste and Water Quality

Issue:
• If the Review Board feels that it is not, the decision will be returned to the Council where it must have to have the backing of 75% of councillors in order to be declared valid.

People with Disabilities
• Current building regulations provide for the access needs of people with disabilities. The implementation of these regulations by Planning Authorities is not being monitored or enforced adequately. Planning Authorities must ensure the implementation of these regulations and standards which meet the needs of people with disabilities in all planning matters (for example, door widths, ramp widths, ramp angles, lift sizes, unobstructed footpath widths).
• Fine Gael will work at council level to adopt and implement the Barcelona Declaration in full. The Declaration, signed in 1995, obliges the Local Authorities to:
• Promote disability awareness and ensure the rights of people with disabilities to be different and their right to receive personal attention.
• Develop policies and an equality/disability proofed decision-making process.
• Develop consultative processes.
• Provide access for people with disabilities to the social and physical environments as well as services.
• Provide training programmes dealing with equality/disability issues.
• Develop monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment procedures for actions, projects and policies regarding equality/disability issues.

FastTracking
• There is a need for outline planning frameworks that provide a fast track for industrial and commercial development (while respecting the demands of sustainable development). Planning Authorities must be given the power to designate areas for particular types of development, specifying clearly the conditions that apply to such developments. They should also be able to institute rapid response monitoring and supervision procedures, thereby make the planning and approval process both more transparent and less time consuming. Where appropriate, the Environmental Protection Agency should be involved from the beginning in the designation process.
• The Environmental Protection Agency must get all the resources, necessary to carry out its mandate to the full.

Household and commercial waste in Ireland has increased by over 60% in the five years to 2002 (source; EPA). That means on average, every man, woman and child generates 600 kilogrammes in waste every year. In Ireland 2.7m tonnes of household and commercial waste was generated in 2001- an increase of 46% in six years.

Simultaneously, our record on recycling is, by European standard, deplorable. We recycle less than 8% of our household waste, compared to 46% in Austria, 44% in Holland, 40% in Belgium and 30% in Denmark.

Already our landfill is at 86% capacity.

Stance:
If we are serious about tackling the waste crisis, we need to think local and aim high.

Proposals: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
• Fine Gael believes it is time to look to our European neighbours - and the great success of Galway City Council has had in reaching a situation where nearly half its household waste is recycled- and set a target of 50% recycling of household waste by 2008. At the moment, householders in Galway are provided with brown, green and grey wheelie bins, bring banks and bring centres designed to empower householders to separate and recycle waste. It is imperative that this infrastructure is extended nationwide. With such a target achieved, the savings to the State will be enormous, both in terms of the financial costs involved in dealing with the current levels of waste, and in terms of the environment around us.
• This initiative will cost money - Ireland at present does not have the necessary recycling infrastructure to deal with the volumes of waste involved. That is why, in order to partly fund such a measure, we propose a doubling of the Plastic Bag Levy (which will raise €12m) and a special tax on excessive packaging in order to provide local authorities with the necessary resources to turn our goal into a reality.

Investment in Water Quality
• Improve grants for group sewerage schemes to the same level available for group water schemes. This will facilitate the prioritisation of infrastructural development and the provision of services in order to aid housing development in towns and villages outside the main population centres.
• We need a greater investment in sewage services and waste water treatment throughout the country. It should be a clear policy objective that all waste water treatment should be brought to the point where waste water can be returned to the Ecosystem without causing any risk to the environment or to human health.

Septic Tanks
• Fine Gael will establish a grant scheme to upgrade septic tanks in rural areas through the installation of modern treatment systems. Priority will be given to vulnerable areas where existing tanks are causing a serious threat to public health and the environment. Consideration will be given to providing an enhanced grant for group sewerage schemes where the increased grant will make such schemes viable in these prioritised areas. Over a five-year period in Government, we will eradicate the potential for pollution from non-functioning septic tanks.

9. Protecting Agriculture

Issue: Following the Mid-Term Review Agreement many farmers are examining how the proposals will impact upon them and how best to move forward.

Stance: Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the family farm remains a viable option and all policy decisions taken should assist this aim.

Policy must assist production and it must also recognise the fact that we have to work towards a product with a competitive advantage that has a market outlet. Some groups such as dairying are set to face major changes following the Mid-Term Review and others are almost certain to lose out, for example farm retirement groups and farmers who sold on calves. Fine Gael is committed to examining how these groups will ultimately be affected and to enacting measures to assist them.

Proposals:
• Live animal trade – Fine Gael recognises the importance of the live animal trade to the agriculture industry, and has raised its concerns with the EU Commissioner. Fine Gael will press to ensure that EU proposals for reform of the live trade will include the inclusion of staging posts and that any proposals will not have a negative impact on the industry.
• Nitrates directive – Fine Gael recognises the need to protect and improve our water quality. The implementation of the directive must be based on scientific fact and that no unnecessary burden will be placed on farm practices. Fine Gael will ensure that adequate funding is provided for the development works required for storage and that the necessary derogations required in advance of this are obtained.
• Farm partnerships – Fine Gael will examine all necessary regulations to ensure that farmers, who so desire, can enter into partnerships to improve efficiency, without suffering any penalties. This will be encouraged in all farming sectors.
• Animal breeding – Fine Gael will promote quality breeding in the suckler herd and will establish a programme of breeding improvement in conjunction with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation.
• Food Standards Authority – Fine Gael will extend the role and functions of the Food Safety Authority to encompass Food Standards to ensure that Irish produced foodstuffs can gain a competitive advantage, by improving quality and labelling.
• Food labelling – We will seek changes in EU Labelling Policy to ensure that the consumer knows what they are eating and to cease the practice of non-EU foodstuffs being passed off as home produce.
• Fine Gael will tackle the rip-off that sees consumers paying high food prices while farmers are not getting the benefit. In the last seven years, food prices have risen by 26%, but farm gate prices have hardly risen at all. A Fine Gael survey into the rip-off revealed that the average mark-up between the price paid to the farmer and the price paid by the consumer is 119%.

Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the family farm remains a viable option.

10. Education

Issue:
Today, the educational potential of our children and young people is being squandered. Unsuitable school buildings, inadequate sporting and science facilities and the lack of assistance for children with special needs all contribute to the problem.

Stance:
Fine Gael’s commitment to education means that we are focussed on supporting education at every level, at every age and at every ability. This means working with parents and students, schools and teachers, to keep children in school, and to give them the help that they require to reach their full potential.

Proposals:
• Educational psychologists: Access to an educational psychologist can make a huge difference to a child with special needs. However, with a quarter of schools waiting more than nine months for access to a psychologist for their students, it is clear that many children are not being given the help they require. Fine Gael will radically expand the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), and believes that children who need a psychological assessment should have a statutory right to that assessment within 6 weeks of their referral.
• Vetting: Child safety at school must be prioritised. Fine Gael believes that people who have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults should be vetted before taking up employment. This means that teachers and all other staff at schools should be vetted.
• National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB): The NEWB was set up in July 2002 to help students to stay in school. The Board needs 300 Education Welfare Officers to provide a full service to schools, but to date has less than one third of that number. If we catch children before they drop out of school, and give them the assistance that they need to reach their potential in the classroom, then we are giving them the best possible assistance on the road towards a successful and fulfilling life. Fine Gael will support the expansion of the NEWB so that all schools in the country will have access to its services.
• Special Educational Resources: Thousands of children are being left waiting for badly needed special educational resources because of delays in dealing with applications for assistance caused by a critical administrative bottleneck in the Department of Education.
• Vocational Educational Committees (VECs): VECs and local development partnerships should be funded and supported in the establishment of homework and breakfast clubs, particularly in areas of disadvantage in their communities.
• The support of parents should be enlisted in these initiatives. The home environment can be critical to keeping children in school for longer, and with a more successful outcome. Parents should be encouraged to become involved in the education and achievement of their children.
• Youthreach and Traveller Education: Fine Gael believes that there should be a radical expansion of Youthreach and Traveller Education programmes.
• Childcare services: Funding to VECs and to local development partnerships to provide childcare services to young parents still in school, or attending early school leaver or second chance education programmes should be restored and enhanced so that more young parents can stay in education.
• Mediation: A local education mediation service, working in conjunction with the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) should be developed to track all children from age 14 years onwards who are at risk of early school leaving. This service will involve counselling, mentoring, appropriate placement and aftercare.
• Fine Gael remains opposed to the reintroduction of third level fees.

11. Better Health

Issue:
There is huge concern throughout Ireland about access to health services, particularly A&E services. The Taoiseach has promised ‘medical cover’ in all hospitals. However, in Hanly speak ‘medical cover’ means having a nurse on duty and a doctor at the end of a telephone.

As a nation, we are facing epidemics in conditions such as asthma and diabetes. Both of these conditions respond well to early and regular treatment. Barriers to early intervention cause complications and exacerbations which, in turn, place further pressure on hospitals and cost the health service millions each year.

More than 450 people take their own lives each year and in excess of 10,000 report to Accident and Emergency having self-harmed. This is an issue which has been ignored for too long.

High medical inflation and a failure to increase the medical card threshold discourage many on an average age from seeking early medical intervention.

Stance:
Fine Gael has made it crystal clear that it is opposed to the closure of vital A&E services in local hospitals. It is not equitable, it is not safe and it is not acceptable. Fine Gael believes that a hospital is not a hospital unless it has a doctor on-site 24 hours a day. We are committed to ensuring that at a minimum every hospital has such a service. Vital though hospitals are, we must also focus on helping people to stay healthy and to support primary care interventions. This approach would help to relieve pressure on the overburdened hospital service.

Proposals:
Fine Gael’s health priorities for Local Government are:
• Major investment in additional acute hospital beds and additional consultants to ensure a timely, high quality service for patients
• Fine Gael favours a major investment in primary health services (such as GPs, community pharmacies, community nursing etc). This will take pressure off secondary services (hospitals). It will facilitate a new approach to health service provision, which includes greater emphasis on preventive care and on citizens taking responsibility.
• The implementation of public health policies across all Government Departments aimed at tackling preventable illnesses and keeping people out of hospital.
• Raising the threshold for medical card eligibility so that people on low incomes will be have better access to primary care.
• Introducing clear, systematic programmes aimed at the prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour. We will implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the National Taskforce on Suicide and we will increase funding for research into suicide and suicidal behaviour.
• Dramatically improving the provision of mental health services. We will introduce a community Early Intervention Service (EIS) to provide a rapid response service for patients with severe mental illness.
• Ensuring effective mechanisms of accountability in any revised Health Board structures so that health services are meeting local needs.
• Appointing a Health Ombudsman to ensure that citizens have recourse to independent information and adjudication of practice and procedure. This would be achieved by creating a Covenant of Rights and Responsibilities for Patients, which would be overseen by the Ombudsman.
• Establishing an office of Surgeon General whose objective is to ensure that health services are not the preserve of vested interests, either political, bureaucratic or medical. The Surgeon General would report directly to Dáil Éireann and work with the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to achieve that objective.
• 6,000-7,000 people die annually from sudden cardiac arrest in Ireland. Fine Gael will actively promote the locating of defibrillators in communities and the training of personnel to use them. In addition Fine Gael will include a provision in development plans, placing a requirement on major commercial developments attracting large numbers of people to provide defibrillator facilities on site.

We must focus on helping people to stay healthy.

12. The Elderly

Issue:
Services for older people in Ireland fall far short of an adequate standard. They are characterised by huge gaps in services, by queues and waiting lists, and by unaffordable costs.

Changes in society have eroded traditional support structures for older people but we have failed to develop proper replacements

The health shortages have been particularly severe on older people. No adequate preventative health strategy has been developed to manage the problems of older age and the crisis conditions in Casualty Departments have acutely affected older people. It is commonplace to encounter long waits on trolleys for attention, untimely discharge to settings without care support, and dispatch to long stay residence instead of rehabilitation that would prolong independence. Ireland has a unique opportunity at the present time with high-income growth and low dependency ratios to lay the foundations for high quality policies for a fulfilled and secure old age.

Stance:
Fine Gael will develop its policy for advancing years based on key overriding objectives:
• To promote active retirement
• To integrate services so that people's needs can be anticipated instead of reacting only to crisis
• To guarantee timely access to care
• To give priority to intervention and care settings which can support the independence of the person in their community
• To guarantee high standards in all services

Proposals:

Active Retirement Fine Gael is determined to expand the scope for an active retirement. Specific proposals include:
• Persons who continue to work after their retirement age will be allowed invest tax free a certain amount each year in a security fund for later use.
• A quota of lottery funds for active retirement programmes and modules will be put in place.
• Improved travel options will include the removal of the peak hour ban for those attending hospital appointments and the development of agreements with other EU States to allow older people avail of travel concessions when overseas.

Facilitating Older People to remain Living Independently Minor adaptations to the home can often enable older people to remain at home with greater independence and a sense of security. No older person should be denied such facilities because they cannot afford them. Among the measures which we propose are:
• Home Subvention Schemes to empower older people to buy in services they feel they need from whatever source they prefer.
• Budgets for maintenance, insulation and essential repair and appliances will be substantially enhanced.
• Adaptations costing less than €3,800 will only need to be certified by the local GP.
• Support for security measures and social monitoring will be improved and the Community Welfare Officer will be given specific responsibility for its development.

Timely Access to Health Care Fine Gael proposes:
• Systematic investment to fill the gaps in acute care and rehabilitation.
• Prioritisation of treatments such as hip replacement, knee replacement, cataract operations and heart bypasses which maintain independence, to secure an acceptable waiting time.
• Protocols that fast track emergency older patients presenting at Casualty Departments.
• A proper discharge plan to support people as they settle back into their homes after a period of acute care.

Access to Residential Care on Fair Terms when necessary Access to long-stay residential care is highly arbitrary, inequitable and lacks transparency. Fine Gael is currently looking at new and equitable proposals for funding the long term care of the elderly.

Fine Gael wants reforms to the Nursing home subvention scheme which are based on the actual cost of care and leave a reasonable amount for personal comfort for the patient. It is essential that we guarantee to meet long-term costs where assets have become exhausted.

Fine Gael will also put in place:
• An independent system for vetting the standards of all long stay care facilities.
• A Register of facilities and of vacancies will be developed and act as a Clearing House so that the search for suitable long stay accommodation will become easier.

13. Supporting Families

Issue:
There is a growing recognition of the need for work/life balance and for measures that support the modern family. Many families now have two parents at work and they must juggle the needs of their children with the demands of their career or their education. Some parents have both childcare and elder care responsibilities at the same time.

The number of parents raising their children alone has risen. Employment rates among lone parents are low. Childcare training, education and other supports are necessary to allow them access work and to support their families.

Stance:
Fine Gael believes that it is possible to have a society which values and supports childhood and the family and to have public policies which enhance that value and support.

Proposals:
Addressing the Needs of the Modern Family Fine Gael proposes the institution of a Biennial National Conference on the Family, sponsored by Government, to focus on the impact of public policy on the family. The themes for such Conferences would include:

• Examination of Social Welfare and taxation as they impact on families.
• Parenting and childcare.
• Reform of Employment law to allow for family-friendly work practices issues.
• Co-ordinate efforts to support joint parenting, child and elder care and support for families experiencing difficulties.
• Review and refine current policy.

Family Friendly Work Practice We propose:
• To embed part-time work in career patterns.
• To increase workplace flexibility for both parents including part time and flexi-time work, personalised hours, job sharing, teleworking and term-time work.
• Reviewing Labour Law to recognise the changes needed to accommodate a situation where both parents work and share in the obligations of parenting and incentivise employers to assist the development of family friendly work practices.

Childcare Fine Gael supports the work being done by County Childcare Committees and we will ensure that they receive adequate funding and support to carry out their vital role.

We propose:
• To double the home carers tax credit to assist those people who choose to stay at home to care for their children or the elderly and increase the income disregard threshold to ensure that home carers qualify for a tax credit equivalent to the PAYE credit,
• After-hours use of school premises for childcare and the development of innovative after-school options,
• To introduce new guidelines for local authorities to facilitate planning for new childcare facilities, which meet certain basic criteria,
• To guarantee quality by agreeing national training standards for early care and education

Recreation and Play We will:
• Champion the further development of children’s play and recreation facilities in all areas, and ensure that each community is a safe, child friendly living environment.
• Work with Local Authorities in the preparation of a local play policy in consultation with children and other stakeholders.
• Invest in the development of footpaths, cycle ways and traffic calming measures
• Support the allocation of the funding required to develop play facilities in disadvantaged communities from the development levies imposed under the Planning and Development Act 2000, and ensure that the facilities are designed and located in areas accessible to children living in poverty and social exclusion.
• Prioritise community recreation facilities to provide positive recreational opportunities within local development strategies and plans.

14. Carers

Issue:
Many carers are isolated and struggling on their own to cope. Voluntary organisations are facing a decline in the number of volunteers. State support is at best patchy and at worst totally absent. Many carers themselves suffer health problems because of the stresses of coping alone. Community and voluntary groups help where they can, but many face funding problems.

Stance:
Fine Gael values and respects the wonderful work of carers. We aim to create a society which asks carers not what they have but what they need. Less than half of full time carers receive any financial support from the State. Fine Gael is determined to develop a New Deal for Carers.

Proposals:
Our proposals include:
• Raising the income disregard for the carer's allowance.
• Paying half rate carer's allowance to those carers who are already in receipt of social welfare benefits.
• Putting in place a minimum guarantee of two weeks respite care for all full time carers.

In the longer term our objectives are to remove the means test altogether from those providing continuous care to persons with high care requirements, and to give the person with a disability more flexibility to arrange the type of care requirement that best suit their needs. As a first step towards these objectives we will introduce a ‘Continuous Care Grant’ which will not be means tested and will be related to care needs and will be paid directly to the disabled person.

taking a stand for Dublin

Fine Gael puts the capital city first – giving it back to the people

Dublin is a great city with a proud history. People want to live and raise their children in one of the best capital cities of Europe. In Fine Gael we want the best for our city.

In recent years the city has become a difficult place in which to live and work. The cost of housing and the cost of living keeps increasing as more and more people are forced out of the city and into adjoining counties. This must be turned around.

The Government’s decentralisation plans will not only leave no major Department of State on the north side of Dublin, but have ensured that thousands of public servants have to leave this city. Decentralisation is bad for Dublin and for the country because the current plans are totally at variance with the national spatial strategy.

Getting around Dublin is becoming more difficult as congestion costs the city over €600 million a year. There is a real sense that nothing works and no one is in charge as the city grows at a rapid rate without any real master plan for the region.

Fine Gael has produced a National Manifesto for the upcoming elections, which addresses the broader challenge facing the nation. However, given the particular nature of the problems facing the capital city, we feel it vital that Dublin has its own set of policies spelt out in detail.

The local elections on June 11th are not just about electing candidates, but must also be about setting out a new agenda for the entire Dublin region. We will work with others to develop that vision for a safer, cleaner, more competitive and smarter city for all the citizens of Dublin. Fine Gael wants to give the city a new political leadership. That’s why we have published our priorities for Dublin in this document.

Executive Summary

1. Reforming Local Government in Dublin: Fine Gael proposes the introduction of legislation for a directly elected Lord Mayor – elected by the people for a five-year term.
2. Getting Transport Moving: Fine Gael proposes the establishment of a new Dublin Transport Authority to take over the existing powers that are vested in 20 separate groups / agencies in Dublin that currently have some responsibility for transport.
3. A Safe City: Fine Gael proposes that the organisation and operation of the police in Dublin should fall under a Dublin Metropolitan Police service, working in tandem with An Garda Síochána.
4. Value For Money Please: We will create an Independent Infrastructure Review Unit which will regularly review and revise cost estimates within all relevant state bodies with responsibility for all infrastructure projects.
5. Dublin: A Multi-Cultural City: Fine Gael proposes that Dublin City Council designate different parts of the city as areas where another ethnic culture can be found, and local authorities provide citizenship courses to those that want to become Irish citizens.
6. A Clean City: Fine Gael will abolish the flat rate annual waste charge, introducing a fair waiver system throughout the city. By doubling the plastic bag tax, we will also make a commitment that within two years, all householders in Dublin will have recourse to recycling bins, organic composters, and other recycling facilities.
7. Dublin: A Home For Everyone: We will assist prospective house buyers achieve their goal of owning their own home by implementing a three point plan, namely introducing an SSIA-type savings account that will give First Time Buyers €1 for every €3 saved over a minimum of two years, abolishing stamp duty on second-hand homes for First Time Buyers, and the frontloading of mortgage interest relief to the first seven years of the life of the mortgage to help in the early, expensive stages of a mortgage.
8. Building Up Public Infrastructure: Fine Gael believes that Local Authorities should be given power to decide funding on projects that come within the remit of the National Lottery, as Dublin is currently losing out in comparison to other regions of the country in terms of its share of the funds.
9. A Family Friendly City: Fine Gael will introduce a Local Business Childcare Project whereby local businesses will co-operate to offer childcare facilities to employees locally at a reasonable rate, with financial investment from Local Authorities.

1. Reforming Local Government in Dublin

Dubliners want to see real political accountability in the people they elect.

Political leaders and not County Managers should be making decisions in the city. Fine Gael wants a directly elected Mayor, in co-operation with elected City and County Councillors to be a real focus of power. Currently, power rests with un-elected officials, which is no basis for democracy and fair representation.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. We will introduce legislation to allow for the election of a directly elected Mayor for the city and county of Dublin for a five-year term.
2. The elected Mayor would appoint a team of Local Ministers with a number of executive powers from a newly comprised Dublin Authority, made up of existing Councillors from the four authorities.
3. The four existing local authorities (Dublin City, Fingal, Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown and South Dublin) will continue to make yearly appointments to the position of Council Chairperson. However, the new Mayor for the entire city will have very specific powers and tasks. Specifically he/she will co-ordinate policy in the areas of County Planning, Business and Economic Development, Transport, Countywide Policing, Environmental and Joint Leisure & Amenity Programmes.
4. Fine Gael will root out waste and inefficiency by conducting a full audit of the multiplicity of local government agencies to see where streamlining can occur, with the clear aim of saving Dubliners money.
5. We want Dublin local authorities to use the existing power to allow local plebiscites on key local issues as a means of encouraging citizens to participate in decision-making.
6. In conjunction with proper planning and the adoption of a City and County Development Plan, we support the promotion of local area action plans, which set our strategic goals in smaller parts of Dublin for a five-year period. Local area action plans should be incorporated into the City and County Development Plans.
7. Maverick rezoning decisions in Dublin must now be sanctioned by the support of the Rezoning Review Board. Where Councillors go against the planning and development advise of their council, Fine Gael’s Rezoning Review Board must sanction the decision before it can be accepted.
8. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should continue to have the powers to dissolve councils that fail to pass a budget, but a fresh election should then take place instead of the appointment of an unelected and unaccountable Commissioner.

2. Getting Transport Moving 

Dublin is the capital of traffic gridlock.

We need to do better for those who use public transport and for those still dependent on the car as their only form of transport.

The case for a truly integrated transport system in Dublin is now well overdue. Fine Gael will provide such a system so that public transport is a real option for commuters. We have got to tip the balance in favour of public transport.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. The establishment of a new Dublin Transport Authority to take over the existing powers that are vested in 20 separate groups / agencies in Dublin that currently have some responsibility for transport. All public transport bodies would be answerable to the DTA for the service they provide.
2. Better ticketing: We will introduce easily accessible prepaid ticketing to reduce delays caused by the collection of fares by drivers. Ticket machines should be available at every bus stop. A ticket purchased at one point on the transport network should be adequate to transfer to any other part of the network or the Luas or Dart. Fine Gael will provide an integrated ticketing system, one ticket for bus/Luas/Dart, along with competition in the Dublin Bus route sector and more investment in park & ride facilities. Bus tickets will also be more available in retail outlets around Dublin. Purchase of an annual ticket should be tax deductible for individuals; the present system for employers will be continued.
The plan includes the establishment of an integrated rail service involving Darts to Maynooth via Dublin 15 and the North Inner City, Lucan, and out as far as North Kildare and to the Airport.
3. Trains: Fine Gael will promote investment in Dublin area suburban railas a priority, particularly with a view to utilising existing tracks to serve newcommunities. Fine Gael favours theIarnrod Éireann plan, which is currentlyon the Minister’s desk. 

The plan includes the establishment of anintegrated rail service involving Darts toMaynooth via Dublin 15 and the NorthInner City, Lucan, and out as far as NorthKildare and to the Airport.

4. Safety: We will make public transport more attractive – providing authorised officers on buses and DARTs, some of which could be in plain clothes, to enforce laws. CCTV will also be part of the new system to maintain public order on public transport. Drug abuse, alcohol consumption and smoking on buses will not be tolerated.
5. New bus routes will be identified in key areas where the population has expanded rapidly. Priority will be given to developing new routes, while some existing routes will be opened to tender. No passenger should have to wait more than 15 minutes for a bus.
6. Quality Bus Corridors (QBCs): We will increase the number and efficiency of quality bus corridors only where the streets/roads are capable of supporting them. Funded by the revenue generated from parking fees, Local Authorities will be charged with ensuring that these facilities are properly maintained, advertised, and signposted, as well as ensuring proper access to the site is provided for in the planning stages. We must avoid the mistakes of the past - for example, park and ride facilities at Newland’s Cross are likely to cause further congestion due to inadequate access from the north-bound lanes of the Naas dual carriageway. Before new QBC’s come into operation, public transport operators have to guarantee a minimum number of buses at peak times.
7. Communicating with Commuters: Real time displays will be erected throughout the bus network so that passengers can tell when the next bus is due
8. Fine Gael will seek to double the capacity of the DART service by investing in rolling stock and signalling to increase the throughput of traffic. Instead of always buying new carriages, Iarnrod Éireann should lease them, which would prove more cost-effective.
9. DART Park and Ride Facilities: Fine Gael will provide for more park and ride facilities along the DART lines, and will licence private and public operations to operate bus feeder services to and from DART Stations, reducing the use of private cars.
10. Air Travel: Fine Gael sees a case for the establishment of a second airport for Dublin or, at a minimum, a second terminal at Dublin Airport. If we do not have an efficient airport system, our tourism and commerce will be threatened.
11. Fine Gael in government will introduce a dedicated traffic corps for Dublin city to enforce traffic regulations and implement Operation Freeflow on a year round basis.
12. The SCATS traffic light system used in Dublin, which currently only controls 180 intersections in the Dublin City Council area, will be extended to South Dublin, Fingal, and Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown where, remarkably, they have different systems in place.
13. Car-pooling: We will encourage car-pooling by permitting cars with three or more occupants to use bus lanes. We believe that this initiative could dramatically reduce the number of cars on the roads during commute hours. Like other proposals, the idea should be tested and only continued if it reduces congestion and does not impede buses using the quality bus lanes.
14. Smart Bike Proposal: We will introduce a Smart Bike System in pilot areas in the city, and if it is successful, the idea could be mainstreamed through all parts of the city and county. The system, which works well in many EU countries, uses information technology to allow commuters use a smart card that they have purchased in a newsagent or supermarket to unlock bicycles parked throughout the city and has the potential of offering public transport users an easy means of getting around the city.
15. Toll Free: Access to the M50 via tollbooths is causing nightmarish traffic jams. Coin operatives should be abolished if measures cannot be found to eliminate delays caused by drivers paying the toll. Technology - such as that currently used in London to collect the congestion charge electronically - should be gradually introduced. We will renegotiate the contract with National Toll Roads to ensure that no motorist has to wait for a specified period at the toll bridge. If this maximum period is breached, the barriers should be automatically raised. This condition is now part of the contracts in place in respect of other toll roads recently opened.
16. Fine Gael demands much greater co-ordination between local business, local authorities and the traffic police in introducing a city wide streamlined off-peak delivery plan for the city. We welcome the pilot scheme in operation in Dublin city centre.

3. A Safe City

Crime in Dublin has increased dramatically since this current Government took office in 1997.

working in tandem with An Garda Síochána.

3. Fine Gael want more Gardaí for Dublin and demand that the governments election promise for 2,000 additional Gardaí be acted upon without delay. This will mean opening a new training centre, as the existing centre in Templemore cannot cope with the additional new recruits. We want new officers trained in Dublin so that as part of their training they can work with Garda Stations that are currently overstretched.

Public order offences, gun crime, violent attacks, racially motivated and homophobic crime, along with attacks on persons and property are common day occurrences in our capital. Whilst alcohol is repeatedly linked to our spiralling crime problem, a number of things can be done to improve the situation.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. Establish Local Police Partnerships under the auspices of the various local authorities in the city where the community, local politicians, relevant authorities and the Gardaí can meet on a regular basis to discuss local policing matters. We believe that police partnerships are essential in countering the existing vigilante threat that is posed in some parts of the city.
2. We are calling for a fundamental change in the operational structure of the Gardaí in Dublin. Dublin policing issues are different to other parts of the country. As such, we are proposing that the organisation and operation of the police in Dublin should fall under a Dublin Metropolitan Police service, working in tandem with An GardaSíochána.
3. Fine Gael want more Gardaí for Dublin and demand that the governments election promise for 2,000 additional Gardaí be acted upon without delay. This will mean opening a new training centre, as the existing centre in Templemore cannot cope with the additional new recruits. We want new officers trained in Dublin so that as part of their training they can work with Garda Stations that are currently overstretched. 
4. In many EU capitals, the presence of a large police force in major pedestrian areas acts as a deterrent to crime. This has never been tried in the city, and should now be acted upon immediately. Furthermore, we are calling for joint patrols of various parts of the city between the Gardaí and local authority uniformed personnel at times of the day when littering and public order offences are prevalent. Joint patrolling by Dublin City Council and the Gardaí could act as a deterrent.
5. A new revitalised ""Neighbourhood Watch"" programme should be relaunched in conjunction with the four Dublin local authorities.
6. Fine Gael will make available funds to roll out the use of CCTV as a means of detecting local crime. CCTV should not just be for business districts.
7. Fine Gael believes that An Garda Síochána should deploy a new policy of recruitment so that all areas of the city have representative members of the force within its ranks.
8. The Drugs Court currently operating in the city centre should now be extended to other parts of the city and out of the pilot phase.

4. Value For Money Please
Dublin now ranks as one of the most expensive cities in Europe.

The rip off culture has taken off as Dubliners are short-changed on virtually everything they buy. Tourism in the capital will be lost unless something is done to stop this culture of rip off. We must also make accountable those agencies that win contracts for major infrastructure projects in the city. Luas was originally costed at €279 million, but has eventually come in at €770 million. The Dublin Port Tunnel is another example of bad value for money. Projects must come in on budget and on time.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. We will create an Independent Infrastructure Review Unit, which will regularly review and revise cost estimates, within all relevant state bodies with responsibility for all infrastructure projects. This review unit would have a remit in all public bodies involved in the delivery of infrastructure projects. It would be an independent body appointed by the Minister for Finance and would include finance, engineering and other recognised national and international experts who would assess the costs of all public infrastructure projects and ensure greater value for money at all stages in the delivery of infrastructure projects. This information would also be available to the Oireachtas and the public. It is essential that local authority finance committees in Dublin play a full role in monitoring the capital programme in their area.
2. We propose that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs be replaced by a pro-active Consumer Rights Enforcer who will be given new powers to drive the consumer agenda, including naming and shaming rip-off merchants. This Enforcer will empower Officers of Local Authorities to carry out inspections and take prosecutions at local level where a breach of pricing policy occurs. Local Authorities should carry out regular price surveys and sporadic investigations, as well as ""name and shame"" publicity campaigns to highlight blatant high margins on certain products.
3. We will demand that price lists are visible to the public.
4. Fine Gael proposes that the local health boards in Dublin should appoint funeral advisory officers to be available on mobile phone throughout the day and after hours to advise on funeral arrangements and how to minimalise costs. Something needs to be done to tackle the exorbitant costs of funerals in the city. To this end, we will promote the creation of a co-operative of funeral undertakers for the benefit of people along the lines of the Irish Credit Union Movement.


5. Celebrating Dublin as a Multi-Cultural City
Thousands of immigrant workers have taken up vital jobs within the services sector of our capital in recent years.

Dublin is now a multi-cultural city and we all have much to gain from the new inhabitants that have come to live here. We recognise their contribution to our society. Without their work, the tourism, health, and financial services industries would collapse. Every person living in Dublin has a basic right to live in a peaceful and tolerant society. Fine Gael wants to encourage the active participation of all ethnic groups within the local democracy of this city.

Fine Gael proposes the following:
1. We are proposing that a new national public holiday for the specific purpose of celebrating multi-culturalism in Ireland be established. The festival of world cultures, now in it fourth year in Dun Laoghaire, is a wonderful example of this celebration of our new city. A new public holiday to celebrate multi-culturalism is something that we should all be able to participate in.
2. Each Local Authority in Dublin should immediately establish local consultation committees with the various non-national communities in the city. Local government in Dublin should tap into the tremendous contribution that these communities have to make in their local area.
3. We propose the establishment of a special liaison service for minority ethnic groups as a means of explaining the provision of local services and providing multi-lingual versions of local authority application forms.
4. Local authorities in Dublin should provide citizenship courses to those who aspire to become full Irish citizens.
5. Dublin City Council should designate different parts of the city as areas where another ethnic culture can be found. For instance virtually every capital city in Europe has a Chinatown etc.

6. Clean City

Dublin has got to clean up its act.

Fine Gael believes that the current waste management strategy policy employed by Dublin local authorities is not achieving its full potential. Incineration should not be an option for a city that has only recently taken to recycling. Much more needs to be done in terms of reducing, re-using and recycling.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. We recognise that domestic waste charges are a fact of life. However, these charges should be operated on a fair basis. Fine Gael will abolish the flat rate annual waste charge. A fair system of waivers should operate throughout the city.
2. We are proposing the establishment of a new local authority platform between the four local authorities of Dublin and local authorities in Britain who are supportive of our position to close the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
3. We will double the plastic bag tax in order to generate funds, ringfenced for improvements of recycling facilities.
4. We will promote the establishment of more recycling green facilities in all communities around the city. We will also improve the level of information given to schools in the Greater Dublin area about the benefits of recycling. We will greatly extend plastic, battery, paper and glass bring centres. We want bring centres to be open throughout the week. In tandem with this, we will increase the number of collections of green wheelie bins from households, depending on demand.
5. With the money generated by charges, we make a commitment that within two years, all householders in Dublin will have recourse to recycling bins, organic composters, and other recycling facilities. We also want local authorities to provide Junk Collection on a much more frequent basis then is currently the case.

7. Dublin: A Home for Everyone

The housing situation in Dublin is chronic.

The current Government has made the situation worse in the last seven years and has failed to provide proper funding to Local Authorities in Dublin to build affordable housing. There is simply no planning in place to deal with Dublin’s rapidly expanding population as housing is now beyond the means of average income families.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. Fine Gael is proposing the establishment of one central application procedure for those who have applied for social housing. In future, instead of making applications for housing to a local authority, applicants would apply directly to this new agency. Rather than having existing Dublin housing authorities compete against each other for a limited housing supply, we believe it makes sense to amalgamate our efforts on a countywide basis for the benefit of all Dubliners. Every effort will be made to ensure that housing is provided in local areas, so that communities can be strengthened.
2. We will help Dublin’s young First Time Buyers with a three-point plan to help them save for a house, buy a house and pay for their mortgage. This will involve:

•SSIA-type savings account that will give First Time Buyers €1 for every €3 saved over a minimum of two years.

•The abolition of stamp duty on second-hand homes for First Time Buyers.

possible to establish special area amenity orders on existing green belt or parks land throughout the county. Housing must not be allowed to encroach upon vital green space.

2. Our parks must be of the highest standard. To this end, we will appoint a Dublin Playground Inspector who will make an independent assessment to the four local authorities on the current condition of playgrounds throughout the county. The quality and standard of playgrounds for our children in Dublin is disgraceful, in comparison with other major capital cities. Our parks do not have the type of security that is needed today. Park rangers/wardens need to be in place and in constant contact with the local police service. There is also a need to have more playing pitches, particularly in newer areas.
3. We will establish a plan to preserve the unique village identities that are in abundance in outlying parts of the county. The villages of County Dublin must be protected from overdevelopment.
4. We believe that the River Liffey could be a wonderful public amenity if it was damned at its mouth, thereby creating a canal like waterway in the heart of the city. This could help the entire inner city area and also help to establish an exciting waterways amenity for the entire city.
5. Our members on Dublin City Council will develop a master plan for the complete renewal of Dublin’s Grand and Royal Canals. Now derelict, the walkways along the canals need to be rejuvenated.
6. Fine Gael believes that the Abbey Theatre should be relocated to the Carlton site on O’Connell Street, if suitable. This decision, above any other decision, would revitalise O’Connell Street while also helping to create a new cultural area close to The Gate Theatre and relocated Abbey.
7. The National Concert Hall should be redeveloped on the existing site in order to provide Dubliners - and all Irish people - with a facility of which they can be proud.
8. We will promote Dublin as a venue for international sporting events, and will provide the infrastructure necessary to facilitate such events such as the Tall Ships, the Overseas Tour de France etc.
9. Young people throughout Dublin City are crying out for skateboarding and rollerblading facilities. Public liability insurance companies must not stand in the way of the creation of these facilities for our young people. Fine Gael will immediately start work on a range of skateboarding parks throughout our capital.
10. Local Authorities should be given power to decide funding on projects that come within the remit of the National Lottery. Dublin is losing out in comparison to other regions of the country in terms of its share of the National Lottery Funds. These funds must not be used as an election slush fund and we believe that allocations should be given over directly to Dublin Local Authorities to determine priorities in their area.
11. Fine Gael believes that a system should be introduced whereby school buildings around Dublin can be used to provide commercial crèche and child-minding facilities outside school hours. We are also calling on the Department of Education to provide classrooms which may become available because of dwindling school numbers to local organisations and groups.

•The frontloading of mortgage interest relief to the first seven years of the life of the mortgage to help in the early, expensive stages of a mortgage.
•Fine Gael seeks the release of suitable state-owned lands in Dublin for affordable housing.

4. As a means of encouraging downsizing, we believe that a tax incentive should be established to encourage older residents to move to purpose built accommodation and be entitled to keep a portion of the asset on the transaction of the sale of their property. This incentive for ""empty nesters"" would serve to free up family homes in prime locations in Dublin – thus diminishing the need for young property hunters to move further outside their location of choice.
5. Fine Gael will support and promote the development of the city in terms of rapidly expanding housing density in parts of the city, which have been underdeveloped to date.
We see tremendous opportunities for infill housing development in the areas east of the Customs House. We will support policies that are designed to concentrate residential development on existing transport corridors or proposed public transport routes. There is a growing need for Dublin authorities to impose Compulsory Purchase Orders on derelict and underdeveloped sites through out the city.
6. Fine Gael commits to the full implementation of the strategic guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which aim to stop the sprawl of the city into neighbouring communities.
7. As the recent Ombudsman’s Report highlighted, planning enforcement is not recognised as a particular priority currently in the City. This has got to change.

8. Dublin Building up our Public Infrastructure

Despite the recent upturn in our economy, many of our city streets and older county villages are in poor condition. We need to see a major injection of public funds in Dublin which will enhance our amenities and facilities. Dublin is a beautiful Georgian city and it is vital that we preserve our heritage for generations to come. We have got to strike the right balance between the old and the new. Local authorities in Dublin play a pivotal role in developing public space for the city and county. The significance of Dublin Bay is a direct result of the improvement of the water quality.

Fine Gael proposes the following:

1. We will develop a new parks policy for the city and county, proposing where

9. A Family Friendly City
Fine Gael believes that families must be facilitated in offering the best possible childcare provision for our children, while offering a choice to those who wish to be part of Dublin’s vibrant workforce. We encourage parents to choose how children are to be cared for in the best possible way. In Dublin we will offer support to parents who wish to re-enter the workplace.

1. Local Business Childcare Project – Fine Gael will initiate a mechanism whereby local businesses will co-operate to offer childcare facilities to employees locally at a reasonable rate. Pooling of resources will reduce costs and will be further financed by direct investment of Local Authorities.
2. We will re-examine child to adult ratios in crèches - capacity can only be increased by lowering charges on crèches or by raising the permitted productivity of their workers.
3. Local Authorities will develop an integrated up-skilling programme aimed at parents who have been out of work for prolonged periods. Areas for upskilling/retraining will be identified in conjunction with Small Medium Enterprises in the City, so as to correlate supply with current demand. This will be funded by rebates based on a percentage of existing corporate rates that are paid by local business. This means that business will see direct and tangible benefit from rate payment.
4. Community centres and amenities are often the lifeblood of a community. They are particularly valuable for families, offering services to children, teenagers, mother and toddler groups, as well as a social outlet for our older population. These facilities have been slipping away. Fine Gael will strive for an active and resourced community centre in every village in Dublin. We will legislate to impose duties on any large commercial developer wishing to locate or expand in residential areas, to provide some serviceable and beneficial community facilities for residents. The local Planning Authority in direct consultation with local residents and public representatives will decide upon the nature and scale of such a required facility.

The Green Party vision for Dublin
Dublin should be the most enjoyable, friendly and 'greenest' capital in Europe. Given proper leadership, we believe this city has the potential to transform itself into a model of sustainable urban living by the year 2020. Our capital should be a cosmopolitan centre of European culture, internationally recognised for its high quality public services and for well-designed, compact, new urban quarters, welcoming to immigrants and confident in its own identity.

Unfortunately poor local government and corrupt planning have meant that Dublin is increasingly associated with urban sprawl and traffic congestion, social division and crime, dirty streets, the gradual disappearance of green space and the deterioration of our historical buildings. To achieve our vision we need a new politics in Local Government

This new politics would start by protecting and enhancing the city's remarkable natural resources by creating a National Park in the Dublin Mountains, linear parks along the Liffey, Dodder and Tolka valleys and a plan to make the best use of our spectacular seafront and bay. Dublin must also be a child friendly city, so that children have places to play and are able to explore their own natural environment. We should set the international standard for waste reduction and recycling and we want first class public transport and telecommunications systems to allow a green economy to prosper.

The Green Party is part of a broader European movement and we know from our colleagues how other European cities work. We want to put an end to the unsustainable sprawl of the city into the rest of Leinster and to ensure that housing is concentrated back towards existing centres, with well-planned integrated communities in areas like the Docklands, the North Fringe and around Heuston station. We also want to reinvigorate our traditional suburbs so that Dublin develops as a network of local neighbourhood centres, each with its own particular identity and vibrant street and community life.

Central government and developers have been calling the shots in Local Government for too long. We want to return real power to our local councils after June the 11th by agreeing a series of local Manifestos setting out how each council will start to achieve this new Green vision for Dublin. We need Green Councillors elected in every ward so we can revisit the concept of a Civic Alliance as set up in Dublin City Council in 1991, which involved a number of political parties agreeing a progressive programme of local government for the city. Our Green Party candidates for Dublin, commit themselves to bringing this about. We believe that the people of Dublin, and its future generations, deserve no less.

On Dublin's local authorities, Green Party councillors commit to delivering on:

(1) A dynamic city economy that delivers on sustainable jobs.
Employment in Dublin is mainly in service industries, creative industries, tourism, administration and new hightech companies all of which should thrive in a green economy. To continue to attract these high value jobs we will need a state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure. These types of employment will also benefit from a Green policy of lowering labour taxes in return for higher taxes on pollution and the use of natural resources. The carbon taxes promoted by the Green Party, and supported by respected bodies such as the ESRI, are very employment -friendly and would result in a significant reduction in the levels of employer's PRSI contributions.

• The Government is building fibre optic networks in 19 other towns and cities in Ireland but we also need such co-ordinated telecommunications infrastructure for the Capital. Our aim should be to have a five megabyte broadband connection available to every household and business in the city by 2006.
• We would fast-track the plans for wind turbines on the Kish bank to help power the city. We also want to start researching how we might exploit the strong tidal flows in the Irish sea as well as developing other proven energy technologies such as combined heat and power systems .
• Fully exploit the job-creation potential from energy efficiency initiatives and cost savings through the introduction of smart domestic switching technology which reduces electricity demand during peak periods.
• Create a dynamic waste economy in Dublin City, involving materials collection, sorting, repair, re-use, recycling and composting activities.
• Ensure that the local authorities in Dublin adopt green procurement policies.
• Encourage localised food production and new local markets.
• Develop Dublin as an 'eco-tourism' destination , with new walking and cycling trails, and the highest environmental standards for tourism providers.
• Support Dublin as a centre for film- making and the other creative arts.

(2) Well- planned communities with affordable, high quality, housing.
The Green Party believes that affordable housing is a fundamental human right that should be enshrined in the Constitution. For many people in Dublin, housing has become overpriced and unaffordable and this trend has been exacerbated by practices such as land speculation and hoarding. The continued funding of political parties by development interests means there is little incentive to change this situation. We are committed to implementing the recent recommendations of the all party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on the issue of private property. We will empower local authorities to recapture some of the value that is added to rezoned land and to use this funding for social and affordable housing. We want to see the existing housing stock in the city used far more efficiently rather than letting the suburbs stagnate due to the lack of flexibility in our housing market. We also want to make environmental design an integral part of all new housing.

To tackle the sprawl of Dublin the Green Party will:
• Ensure that well-planned, high density, mixed- use developments proceed in areas like the south and north docks, the North Fringe and around Heuston Station.
• We will allow greater community involvement in major planning decisions.
• We believe that there is already sufficient zoned land in Fingal, Dun Laoghaire and South Dublin for housing . By introducing an annual zoning levy on serviced zoned land which remains undeveloped. we would bring real planning power back to the councils and put an end to 'land hoarding'.
• Stop the spread of one-off houses into the Dublin Mountains.
• Make greater use of the Derelict Sites Act to make vacant land and under-used buildings available for communities.

To provide more affordable housing for Dublin the Green Party will:
• Empower local authorities to compulsorily purchase land, at existing use value plus 25%.
• Increase the stock of social housing until the local authority waiting lists in Dublin are eliminated.
• Campaign for homeless action plans to be placed on a statutory basis to tackle the issues of homelessness and travellers' accommodation in Dublin.
• Push for the full implementation of landlord registration, regular monitoring of rented accommodation and prosecutions of persistent health and safety violations.
• Work towards the replacement of the rent allowance payment with tenure- neutral transferable housing benefit.

To ensure more efficient use of existing housing the Green Party will:
• Push for a significant reduction in the levels of stamp duty for those who wish to 'trade down'.
• Encourage the splitting of older housing stock into two to provide for inter-generational housing provision.
• Carry out a survey of empty properties in each local authority area with a view to ensuring their efficient use.
• Provide sufficient resources for the effective maintenance and repair of local authority housing and prioritise action for estates in disrepair.

To promote better environmental design in all housing, the Green Party will:
• Promote technologies such as solar power or heat pumps in new house-building through changes to the Building Regulations and through financial incentives.
• Introduce an energy rating standard for new homes.
• Provide insulation and energy conversion grants for the unwaged, those on low incomes and older people to tackle fuel poverty.

(3) A clean and beautiful city.
Dublin’s location, its open mountains and sweeping bay, should makes us the envy of other capital cities in Europe. Key to our vision is the protection of these advantages and their development for the benefit of all our citizens. We also want to restore our most important civic spaces by redesigning them around people rather than the motorcar. Dealing with our waste is the biggest environmental challenge we face. A zero waste strategy to reduce, reuse and recycle our waste is the intelligent way to go.

To ensure the best use of Dublin Bay the Green Party will:
• Push for a long-term study to be carried out on the development of Dublin Bay.
• Will oppose any further infill of the Bay and support the relocation of some of the port activities to allow for new housing developments.
• Develop a coastal walkway and cycleway from Bray to Balbriggan.
• Ensure that every beach on the Bay achieves Blue Flag status and that we also protect our unique birdlife habitats.
• Reopen all the traditional sea baths along the bay as public amenities.
• Restrict trawler fishing in the bay to create a special leisure angling zone.
• Provide daily information on water quality and the level and sources of any discharges into the bay.

To ensure the best use of our river valleys and waterways we will
• Create a park and wildlife corridor along the Liffey valley.
• Stop any further zoning along the Dodder valley and create a joined-up network of public parks from Tallaght to Ringsend.
• Develop the amenity potential of the Royal and Grand Canals and their towpaths.

To ensure the best use of our hills and mountains the Green Party will
• Establish a National Park in the Dublin Mountains to make best use of the existing state forests and other public open spaces.
• Set up a new Dublin Uplands Council made up of representatives from local authorities, landowners, and sports, recreational and wildlife groups to co-ordinate the management and development of the hills.
• Establish public rights of way, new public transport services and cycle routes to create access to this National Park.

To create an attractive urban environment for Dublin, the Green Party will:
• Take private cars and trucks out of some of our most important civic spaces such as the city quays, Parnell Square and College Green. And reinvent them as attractive riverfronts, city squares and urban spaces where people can enjoy their time working, living and relaxing.

We will create pedestrian priority areas with tree-lined boulevards from Heuston Station along the Quays to the Docklands and from Parnell Square down O'Connell Street via College Green and Grafton Street to St. Stephens' Green.

We shall seek an Urban Plan for this area that puts pedestrians and cyclists first, increases tree planting and public sculpture, promotes well-designed street lighting, facilitates public transport, - is fully accessible to persons with disabilities.

This will provide a vibrant civic and retail environment and we think that College Green would then be seen as one of the best public piazzas in all of Europe.
• Promote city farms such as the Airfield trust and other city farms as well as introducing a citywide system of public allotments.
• Offer short-term leases on small new café premises within our parks.
• Use development plans to protect and enhance existing open spaces, amenity areas, community gardens and key institutional lands.
• Protect Dublin's wildlife corridors and habitats, particularly when large infrastructural projects are being carried out. And support more tree planting in urban areas.
• Introduce much higher financial penalties for damage to Protected Structures and for breaches of the building regulations.

To look after our waste the Green Party will :
• Make sure every home, apartment and office complex in Dublin has segregated waste collection for dry and wet waste.
• Fast-track local, accessible, bring-banks, recycling centres, and closed vessel central composting systems.
• Oppose the development of an incinerator at Ringsend.
• Employ more environmental officers to increase recycling rates for commercial waste and move Dublin towards the goal of becoming a ‘Zero Waste’ city.
• Draw up Litter Action Plans for each neighbourhood and involve local businesses, schools and community groups in their implementation.
• Introduce a name and shame policy for those who litter, and increase the number of bins for dog dirt.

(4) A city with excellent public services for all.
The Green Party's vision of Dublin is of a city that provides all of its inhabitants with high-quality public services in the best European tradition. At present, Government policy supports a level of state expenditure on road-building that is four times the equivalent expenditure on public transport. We want to reverse that trend and to ensure significant investment in a 21st century public transport system that is on a par with other European cities such as Paris, Madrid, Helsinki or Vienna

We favour a decentralised model of healthcare with a strong emphasis on primary care services. We want the current crisis in our health services tackled through investment in a network of modern, high-quality, well-planned, 24 hour, drop-in community medical centres which will keep people out of the casualty units of the main hospitals.

We want to see local authorities keeping a strong involvement in the delivery of health services in their areas. We support leaner and restructured health boards with formal representation for patient/consumer groups, answerable to the newly proposed regional health authorities.

The Green Party is committed to making comprehensive and inclusive education available to all. We believe our education system must do more for children with special needs to ensure that they can also enjoy opportunities to access integrated school environments. We are supportive of diversity in educational provision and a variety of teaching models designed to meet a range of community and parental preferences. We want to see new schools being provided where communities are growing and new school transport bus services to help cut down on traffic congestion.

To provide an excellent integrated public transport system the Green Party will:
• Introduce an integrated Transport and Land Use Authority for the Greater Dublin Area.
• Support the building of a Metro from Bray to Swords.
• Build a rail inter-connector between Spencer Dock and Heuston Station to link our national rail system so trains can run non-stop from Belfast to Cork or from Sligo to Wexford.
• Connect the two existing Luas lines and then extend the network to Lucan, Rathfarnham and Coolock.
• Introduce new Quality Bus Corridors on orbital routes to link city neighbourhoods.
• Introduce a fully integrated ticketing system for all public transport.
• Insist that all taxis be fully wheelchair accessible within five years.
• Introduce a car pooling system allowing people access to private cars when they need them.

To provide local, community-based, health services the Green Party will:
• Promote the development of 24 hour community health centres staffed by multi-disciplinary teams to take the pressure off the large hospitals in Dublin.
• Give primary care teams better access to hospital services.
• Oppose the closing of the A&E Departments of St Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown and St Michael's Hospital, Dunlaoghaire.
• Provide emergency funds to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to contract beds in private nursing homes and increase the availability of 'in-home' care for elderly people to free-up bed spaces in acute hospitals.

To provide excellent and inclusive educational services the Green Party will:
• Promote an 'Integrated Public Partnership' approach to the building of new schools in areas where the community is growing, involving local authorities, school boards and the Department of Education.
• Integrate school transport into an overall strategy for urban transport provision.

(5) A child-friendly city with a rich cultural life.
We believe that it is vital for society to get the early years right and to create an environment which helps parents to raise their children. Our car based transport system makes it difficult for children to experience the natural environment and is also contributing to the rise in obesity in our society. We want to ensure that children can once again play in their own local areas without fear of being run down. To make the necessary changes we believe all planning decisions should be child-proofed so that the needs and care of children become an integral part of all planning decisions. We want to ensure the provision of a range of public parks, children's playgrounds and sports and leisure facilities in order to encourage active healthier lifestyles for families and their children.

In order to create a healthier urban environment for children the Green Party will:
• Ensure that local authorities draw up a registry of green open spaces in their areas and use revenue from the collection of Development Levies to develop some of these areas as children's playgrounds, public parks or wildlife trails.
• Encourage greater public access to private outdoor sports areas, such as school playing fields.
• Use some of the Development Levy revenue collected by local authorities to fund sports and recreational facilities in local neighbourhoods such as skateboard parks, basketball courts, running tracks and football pitches.
• Draw up a local register of childminders and work through the planning system to ensure the increased provision of community childcare facilities and community crèches with flexible drop-in arrangements.

To ensure a safer urban environment for children the Green Party will:
• Allow for 20mph speed limits in residential areas to help ensure the safety of children playing on the streets.
• Implement a 'Safe Routes to School' system for each primary and secondary school in Dublin.

To promote child and family-friendly cultural activities the Green Party will :
• Re-institute the Dublin City Carnival.
• Fund more Community Arts programmes and other cultural activities for young children.
• Promote the greater availability of the Musical Instrument Loan Scheme through local authorities.
• Continue to develop the children's sections of public libraries.
• Build a new Metropolitan Library of international standing which would promote Dublin as the ‘city that reads’.

(6) A city of thriving communities with civic pride and strong local democracy.
The Green Party believes that a strong sense of civic pride is essential to the creation of a healthy and sustainable city in which all of its citizens have a stake. The role of local government is key to fostering the kind of city culture where residents, businesses and other groups work closely with the local authority to develop and maintain a quality living environment for all. We appreciate the growing public frustration at the limits of official public consultation processes, particularly in relation to planning

issues. The Green Party believes it is vital that meaningful opportunities are made available for public input into the planning process and that maximum transparency is ensured. The Green Party favours local authorities having greater control in deciding how their revenues are raised and spent rather than the current system of excessive central government control.

The safety of our streets and our neighbourhoods also contributes to a healthy civic culture. We want to see crime prevention achieved through investment in good design and management of public spaces and effective community policing in partnership with local communities. We believe that serious drug problems are better tackled using a social and medical rather than a criminal approach.

To encourage public involvement in local government decision-making the Green Party will:
• Introduce directly-elected Mayors on each local authority working in a cabinet made up of the City or County manager, the director of services and the six chairpersons of the strategic policy committees (who would be in full time paid positions with their own back-up office and research facilities.)
• Push for council meetings to be brought out to community venues, and to be held at times that facilitate maximum public participation.
• Each Council local area committee to meet in a local town hall or venue.
• Make the minutes of council meetings, planning documents and other relevant information easily accessible by the public on each council's website.
• Support the piloting of local referenda, online polling and other innovative participatory mechanisms.
• Encourage the piloting of a participatory budgeting processes.
• Call for an independent evaluation of the Agenda 21 initiatives being run by each of the Dublin local authorities
• Ensure the provisions of the Barcelona Declaration which ensures that disability access rights are fully implemented.
• Ensure all of the local authorities' policies and practices are equality and child proofed.

To make Dublin a safer city the Green Party will:
• Ensure that public spaces are designed and managed properly and upgrade all street lighting.
• Introduce more community policing and more Guards on bikes.
• Promote frequent consultation between Gardai and local community liaison committees.
• Reform the Garda Complaints procedure.
• Provide more resources to the Juvenile Liaison Scheme, the Community Garda programme and the probation service.
• Support the establishment of an independent body to compile and monitor crime statistics.

To tackle the drug problem in Dublin the Green Party will:
• Support comprehensive treatment services at local level for drug users, in partnership with communities.
• Provide drug education programmes in schools..
• Reverse the current phasing out of Community Employment Schemes and support disadvantaged communities with education, training and employment opportunities.
• Increase recreation and sports facilities for young people, particularly in disadvantaged areas.
• Provide greater resources for local Drugs Task Forces.

Conclusion
Our politicians have allowed our system of local government to become increasingly irrelevant.
The people of Dublin are now aware of the planning corruption which some officials and councillors were willing to benefit from.
Furthermore, there has been an abdication of political responsibility as special arrangements between Labour and Fianna Fail in the City Council, and Fine Gael and Fianna Fail in other councils have divided the spoils of elected office without sharing any vision as to how Dublin should be developed.
The elections on the 11th of June allows the electorate a vital chance to change this system by voting for a party with a real vision as to how our city can work.

Whatever way you look at these Local Elections, the best vote is a vote for Labour.

If you want to vote against the Government, the most powerful message is one which says you want to change the government, and not just complain about it. That means voting for an alternative. And that means voting Labour.

If you want honesty in Local Government, you vote Labour. Because no other party has Labour's record of integrity on our city, county and town councils. Many politicians from other parties have brought shame on our local government system through bribery and corruption. No Labour councillor has been before a tribunal accused of corrupting the planning process and betraying public trust. Labour is proud of our record of integrity and honesty in relation to planning.

If you want the system of Local Government in Ireland to be changed, then you vote Labour, because only Labour has detailed radical proposals for the reform and remapping of the councils.

If you want your local council to do a better job, you vote Labour, because Labour has the greatest commitment to local democracy, and Labour has the best policies on the things that Councils do. That is what we will demonstrate in this Election manifesto.

Housing

The Housing Crisis is the result of seven years of Fianna Fáil/PD rule.

Seven years ago, when Labour was last in Government, working families on modest incomes could afford to buy a home of their own. People on Council waiting lists got housed within a reasonable time, and there were far fewer homeless.

But now, after seven years of Fianna Fáil and the PDs
• House prices have trebled. In 1997, the average price of a new house was €97,000. Now it is over €300,000.
• House prices have increased by 9 times the rate of inflation; 5 times the rate of increase in average earnings and 4 times the rate of increase in the cost of building.
• A house which takes 100,000 to build, costs 300,000 to buy! That gap opened up in the last seven years, under Fianna Fáil and the PDs.
• Nearly half of all new families can not now afford to buy a home. According to the Local Authority Housing Strategies, 33% of new families nationally, 42% in urban areas and 50% in Dublin can not afford to buy!
• The numbers on Council Housing lists have doubled, up from 26,000 in 1996 to over 60,000 now. Less than 5,000 local authority houses are being built each year. It was 8,000 under Labour in the mid-eighties, when the country was much poorer.
• There are twice as many homeless as in 1997.
• They have failed to legislate to give basic legal rights to private tenants. The Report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector has still not been implemented, four years after its publication!
• Under the Partnership Agreement with the social partners, the Government agreed to provide an additional 10,000 Affordable houses. To date, none have been built, none started and none even designed!

Meanwhile, the builder friends of Fianna Fáil have grown rich on the housing crisis. Land Rezoners and speculators have made huge fortunes. And Fianna Fáil has made them even richer, by halving their Capital Gains Taxes!

Instead of tackling the causes of the Housing Crisis, Fianna Fáil has attacked its victims. They abolished the First Time Buyers Grant. They gave Tax Incentives to Investors. They sabotaged the Affordable Housing Scheme. They hiked up rents. They cut the Rent Allowances of those in the poorest circumstances.

The Housing record of Fianna Fáil and the PDs is shameful, and they should be told so on June 11th.

Labour believes that Shelter is a basic right, and that every household should have a home of their own. That is why we say that there should be a Constitutional right to housing. And it is why Labour, whenever in Government, always provided for the housing needs of the people.

Labour has the most complete and fully researched policy on Housing.

Labour believes that Land speculation and profiteering is at the heart of the Housing Crisis. That is why we have proposed new laws to control the price of building land, in order to make housing affordable for the working family. The All Party Committee on the Constitution agrees with us. The Kenny Report on building land should be implemented. But the Taoiseach is still dithering. Still nervous of the vested interests.

Labour serves no vested interest. Our only interest is in the household trying to establish and keep a home. Our main proposals on Housing are to:
• Control the price of building land. Implement the recommendations of the All-Party Committee. The Government should now accept the Labour Party Private Members' Bill which was voted down last October, and which contains the essential measures endorsed by the All Party Committee.
• Double the output of Social Housing to provide housing for those on Council waiting lists.
• Implement the Strategy on Homelessness. How can a wealthy country justify so many sleeping in doorways?
• Legislate to give basic rights to tenants. More Irish families have lost their homes through eviction, during the past seven years under Fianna Fáil and the PDs, than during any equivalent period of British rule in the nineteenth century.
• Legislate to provide consumer protection for home-buyers, to stop price gazumping and to force developers to finish off housing estates.
• Repeal the new regulations on Rent Allowances.
• Change the income limits for the Shared Ownership Scheme and the Affordable Housing Scheme, to make them more available.
• Support Voluntary and Co-operative Housing. Councils should ensure that sufficient sites are available.
• Reform the Rent Scheme. Now, every time a Council tenant gets a pay rise or a Social Welfare increase, it is clawed back by the Council in increased rent.
• Ensure that vacant, Council houses are re-let within a reasonable time. Empty, boarded-up houses are an affront to those on the waiting lists.
• Increase funding for Disabled Persons Building Grants.
• Implement the plans for the housing and settlement of Travellers.
• Strengthen the legislation on Estate Management to include all forms of house tenure, in order to deal more effectively with anti-social behaviour in housing estates.

The end of the Housing Crisis begins on June 11th., by voting Labour and by electing the maximum number of Labour Councillors.

Planning

The Labour Party believes in good planning and Sustainable Development. Our Councillors have an honourable record of integrity and of acting in the public interest on planning matters.

There is a need for considerable reform of Planning at both local and national levels:

Enforcement

The biggest weakness in the Planning system at present is the failure of Local Authorities to adequately enforce the Planning laws and the conditions of Planning permissions. Recent television documentaries and the Annual Report of the Ombudsman have highlighted this. Labour believes that a Planning Inspectorate should be established to concentrate on Enforcement. On all Councils Labour will make the enforcement of planning decisions a priority.

Development Plans

The new Planning Act, introduced by Fianna Fáil and the PDs has greatly diminished the rights of the public in relation to planning matters, and especially regarding the Development Plan. The powers of County Managers have been greatly increased. Development Plans have become more like a charter for developers than a contract with the people. Labour wants to amend the Planning Act to restore control over the development Plan to the people.

Consultation

The process of public consultation in this country is seriously flawed. Huge sums of public money are spent engaging consultants and in the production of confusing Environmental Impact Statements, but the views and concerns of the public are usually ignored. Labour believes that there is a need for a new Public Consultation procedure, which will listen respectfully to the public, will genuinely try to resolve problems over development projects and will ensure that necessary development is compatible with environmental and community needs.

Unfortunately, the Government appears to be going in the opposite direction, and they are planning new legislation to ""fast-track"" development, which will not be published until after the local elections.

Planning Fee

The Labour Party strongly opposed the introduction of the E20 Fee for making a Planning objection. We consider it to be a charge on a democratic right and we believe it should be repealed.

Spatial Strategy

Three years ago, the Labour Party published a draft National Spatial Strategy, (""Visions of Ireland""), in which we mapped out the way in which a growing and increasingly prosperous Ireland should develop. We showed how, with good planning, the housing needs of our people could be met, how residential development could be integrated with transport and other infrastructure, how community and neighbourhood could be fostered and how a sustainable balance could be struck between urban generated development and the protection of the Environment.

Unfortunately, the FF/PD Government took a different and more laissez-faire approach to national planning. Their so-called National Spatial Strategy was published after decisions had already been made on the National Development Plan, and now it has been abandoned by the announcement on ""Decentralisation"".

Rural Housing

The draft Guidelines on Rural Housing published by Minister Cullen will neither protect the countryside nor make it easier for rural residents to get planning permissions. The Minister chose not to make regulations nor to issue a directive, either of which could be enforced. Instead he chose to publish draft guidelines which can be ignored.

An Bord Pleanala

The independence of An Bord Pleanala has been called into question by a number of decisions where the Board has overturned the recommendations of its own inspectors. Labour wants the Planning laws to be amended so that in such cases An Bord Pleanala will at least be required to give full reasons for such decisions.

Conservation

New Architectural Heritage laws were passed some years ago, but they are not being implemented by Local Authorities, mainly because of lack of resources. Labour is strongly committed to conservation and to the protection of our architectural heritage. Our Councillors, therefore will press councils to implement conservation measures.

Reform of Local Government

The Labour Party has published the most far-reaching proposals for the reform, reorganisation and re-mapping of Local government in Ireland.

Our system of local administration, through which unelected city and county managers exercise most of the executive power, was adopted in the 19th century, when we were still under British rule. It is past time for it to be changed.

Ireland has the weakest system of Local Government in Europe. Under the FF/PD Government, elected councilors have been stripped of their powers in relation to roads, waste management, waste charges and many planning functions. These powers have been handed over to unelected Managers. Ultimately it is the people who have been left powerless, in a system, which is neither democratic nor local.

The Labour Party is proposing a new modern system of local government, which is more democratic and accountable and which will provide a better quality of service for the public.

Devolution

Labour is proposing a major devolution of Government functions from the national to regional and local authorities. Every Government department and State Agency should be examined to identify those functions which can be performed more effectively and appropriately at a more local level. Examples should include school buildings and school transport, the distribution of National Lottery funds, employment services and training, rural development, social welfare services and coastal zone management.

Accountability

All public services, including those provided by private bodies, should be made accountable to the public, through Local Councils. A new Public Services Accountability Bill should be enacted, which would oblige the providers of any public service, the holder of public licenses, or the recipients of public funding, to account to the local councils for the discharge of their public remit.

Re-mapping

The boundaries of Local Authorities should be remapped to make them more relevant to modern needs. Where a dispute arises over Local Authority boundaries, the issue could be decided by vote of the people concerned, in a Local Plebiscite.
• Regional Authorities should be established, and would have overall responsibility for strategic planning, transport and traffic, economic development, health services and Communications infrastructure. The Regional Authorities would be directly elected, at the same time as Local Authorities.
• A Dublin Regional Authority should be established, which would have overall responsibility for the running of the city and county. It would be responsible for Transport and Traffic, and for overseeing the services which are delivered Dublin-wide. The DRA would be directly elected and be headed by a directly elected Mayor of Dublin.
• The current Dublin City Council and the three Dublin County Councils would be replaced by 10-12 Dublin District Councils, based on populations of approx. 100,000, each of which would have the status of a County Council.
• City Authorities could be established for the other larger cities in the country, and/or Regional Authorities could be established for different regions, e.g. South-East or Mid-West.
• The larger Town Councils would be given the same status as County Councils.

Democracy

The position of County Manager should be abolished, and be replaced by a Council Chief Executive, who would be subject to the policy decisions made by the elected Council, and whose executive functions would be limited to those originally intended in the City and County Management Acts.
• The power of the Minister to abolish a Council and replace it with a Commissioner should be ended. Instead, where a Council fails to adopt an Annual Budget, the Council should stand suspended, and fresh elections should be held to elect a new Council for the remainder of the five year term.
• Each Local Authority should have a Directly Elected Mayor, for the five year term of the Council. Mayors should be full-time.
• FINANCE. As functions are devolved from the centre to local level, the corresponding resources and finance should also be transferred.
• Rates should be levied on State owned property. There is no continuing justification for exempting State owned property from the rates regime which applies to privately owned businesses.

Waste and Recycling

Waste is a problem of modern society. There is too much of it. There is nowhere to put it. And it costs a lot to manage.

Managing waste used to be a public service. But now Fianna Fáil and the PDs are turning it into a private business. Throughout the country they want to build private incinerators (which will encourage the production of waste!), they want to privatise waste collection and they want to make the householder pay the full cost. What a collection of Wasters!

Meanwhile, there is an outbreak of illegal dumping, and of illegal export of waste.

Minister Cullen wants to increase waste charges up to €700 a year! He has said publicly that he wants householders to pay the full economic cost of the waste service.

There is another way. Labour is the only party to produce a fully costed alternative on Waste Management.

Labour believes that investment should go to recycling. Recycling can not work without a Recycling Infrastructure. Since the closure of the Glass Bottle Company, glass is now sent to the North. Plastics are sent to England. Tetrapak is sent to Scotland. And paper is sent to China. All because they can not be recycled here! We need to build up a recycling industry in Ireland, by investing in recycling plant and facilities and by developing markets for recycled products.

The producers of waste, such as excess packaging, should bear the cost. That way they will have an incentive to reduce waste and to encourage recycling.

There is a fair and responsible way to manage our waste problem. On the Councils, Labour Councillors will:
• Press for increased recycling, composting and re-use facilities.
• Seek effective implementation of the Litter Pollution Act
• Force Councils to fulfil their own legal obligations by keeping public places free of waste and litter
• Investigate and where necessary seek prosecutions for illegal dumping
• Seek proper regulation of private waste service providers

Change the Bin Charges

Labour is opposed to the present Bin Charges.

Labour says that the Bin Charges are unfair. For some low income families, the annual charge now amounts to a full week's wages. The charges take no account of ability to pay. Most charges are not related to the amount of waste. There is no real incentive to recycle or reduce waste. At very least, some changes should be made to the charges.

Up to last year, Councillors had the right to decide Waste Charges. Fianna Fáil and the PDs changed that and gave the power to the County Managers. Labour opposed that legislation, and we intend to repeal it, when we are back in Government.

Labour proposes the following changes to the Bin Charges:
• There should be no charge for recycling
• Any charge should be based on the amount of waste presented
• There should be an allowance for large families
• Any Charges should be related to income, so that households who can not afford the charges will be relieved from paying them.
• There should be a National Waiver Scheme, which would apply to both Council and private collection services.
• Increases in charges should be limited to inflation

The power to make charges should be removed from County Managers and given back to the elected councillors who are accountable to the people. Waste collection and management should remain a public service, and therefore Labour opposes the privatisation of waste services.

The Minister for the Environment should introduce Regulations to govern the Waste Services, where they are already privatised.

Health

This Government was elected on a promise to end the waiting lists of people who need urgent medical care. Yet another broken promise - and this broken promise is keeping people sick and in pain. A government that neglects the needs of vulnerable people, that breaks its promises to people who are ill, deserves to be punished. In the local elections in June, they should be.

They also promised 200,000 additional medical cards. Instead they removed the medical card from many of those who needed it.

Our health services employ thousands of dedicated people. But the service is often under pressure, understaffed and unfairly delivered. After all the broken promises very sick patients still wait on trolleys and wheelchairs in A&E Departments; hospital beds are still closed; and thousands of patients are waiting months, even years to get the hospital care that they need. You and your family deserve better than that.

The Hanly Report, which has been accepted by the Government, threatens to downgrade and remove A&E services from many local hospitals. Now, just before the local elections, Ministers are busy trying to re-assure local communities that their hospital is safe.

But we don't believe them! The Labour Party has led the protest campaigns about all the broken promises. But we want to do far more than protest. We want to make a real difference. Our policies - which put patients first always - include:
1. Quality, equality and value for money in Healthcare.
2. Development of Community and Primary Health Care.
3. Effective action to end hospital waiting lists.
4. Access to Accident and Emergency Services to be protected from closure.
5. Steady investment and capacity building in health.
6. Democratic accountability in the management of our health service.

Childcare

Parents continue to face a childcare crisis, in terms of both availability and affordability. The Fianna Fáil/PD Government has initiated no policy to assist parents. Labour believes that local authorities can play a role in supporting parents in the choices they make about caring for their children. We want a free preschool place for every child over three, and financial support for childcare at all levels
• Expand childcare and after-school services
• Paid family leave for both parents, with scope for couples to divide leave between them as they choose.
• Direct financial support for childcare costs
• Childcare needs to be built into housing development as condition of planning permission
• A pre-school place for every three-year old

People with Disabilities

The Labour Party is committed to ensuring that Irish Local Authorities sign up to, and implement the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. This commits cities to including people with disabilities as full citizens with access to services, public spaces, housing, health, education, and all other areas of activity under the control of local Government. The commitment is simply not just signing up to the declaration but also to drawing up an Action Plan consistent with the declaration which includes such inclusion and evaluation deadlines.

Labour Councillors will work on every Council for the implementation of the Barcelona Declaration.

Education

The Labour Party is strongly committed to the concept of life long learning. Vocational Education Committees, which are appointed by Local Authorities, following the local elections members, are major providers of Education, especially Adult Education and Further Education. Labour is committed to the appointment of VEC members who have a deep interest and knowledge of education and of the needs of the local community.

Adult and Further Education are powerful means to open up opportunities to those who were let down by the school system in the past. It is the door through which many people in disadvantaged communities have the opportunity to build up their knowledge and skills.

Labour Party Councillors have, through their participation in V.E.C.'s, Adult Education Committees and County and City Development Boards, played a pioneering role in developing the Adult Education sector from a very low base. However, Ireland still lags behind most of our E.U. neighbours in providing for life long learning.

The Adult Education, Further Education and PLC sectors are most responsive to communities that have been educationally disadvantaged. They must be developed and resourced.

We are committed to:
(a) Implementing the White Paper on Adult Education and the Report on the Task Force on Life Long Learning
(b) Prioritising funding and resources for this sector which has slowed down considerably in the past two years
(c) Providing secure funding for the development of Adult Literacy Programmes
(d) A Basic Education Work Place Fund focused on Literacy skills in particular as agreed in 'Sustaining Progress'.

Education continued
(e) Restoration of child care funding to V.E.C.s which was reduced by 37% last year
(f) Reversal of the Back to Education restriction from 15 months on a qualifying payment back to six months.
(g) Removal of the cap on PLC places
(h) Implementation of the McIver Report - to establish proper structures and recognition for the Further Education/PLC sector

Transport and Traffic

The country is choking, gridlocked by traffic. This Fianna Fáil/PD government told us that tackling the problem was its priority. So far, they have done nothing - the only vehicles that move quickly in the capital city today are the limos of EU ministers and officials. Congestion is getting worse, bus corridors remain unfinished. Bus and rail services cannot meet demand, and major projects like LUAS are years behind schedule and way over budget. Little done, and everything still to do.

Public Transport is a Labour priority. We must modernise transport services and get the country moving again.

Labour will
• Establish a Transport Authority for Greater Dublin, coordinating and regulating all transport, ensuring adequate and reliable bus and rail services are provided in all parts of Dublin city and county;
• Establish a special Traffic Corps to enforce traffic laws and ensure the free flow of traffic;
• Give priority to safety for pedestrians and cyclists;
• Give greater powers to Councils to impose penalties where road-works unreasonably delay traffic or where reinstatement is poor.
• Oppose CIE privatisation: evidence from Britain and other countries shows privatization means poorer services and higher fares;
• Support an underground Metro, serving the airport, built at a realistic price with property owners and developers who stand to benefit from it paying a fair share of the cost.

The Safe Society

We all want to live and raise our children in a community that feels safe and secure.

We want to walk the streets of our towns and cities freely and without fear. It is our right. But anti-social behaviour and drug related crime are making life miserable for too many. We deserve better.

This Fianna Fáil/PD government has failed to deal with criminal activity and refused invest in tackling crime.

The Labour Party believes that the quality of life in a community is determined by good planning, adequate resources AND effective policing.

We need the 2000 extra Gardai promised by the government before the elections. But a new model of policing is also needed to restore the link between the Gardai and the community which has broken down in many areas. The answer lies in Community Policing based in the local community.

A Community Policing Forum, for instance, would bring together the local Gardai, the local authority, public representatives, local residents and business groups and other relevant agencies, such as, health, education and employment boards. Labour will propose that Councils should take the initiative to establish such forums.

The Gardai must ensure that their policies and activities meet the needs and priorities of the local community. Local Forums can help make this happen.

Local Policing Forums involve more than the democratic accountability of the Gardai. The Forums will also provide a means by which local authorities play their part in making our neighbourhoods safer, through for example, the improvement of public lighting and the appropriate siting of CCTV.

Council Services

People are entitled to the highest quality of service from their local Council.

Labour Councillors will work to ensure that the core services of the Council Roads, Traffic Management, Water, Sewage, Waste, Fire Protection, Planning, Community services, Arts, Libraries, Parks etc - are provided efficiently and cost effectively.

Labour respects the Council staff who provide these services, and we believe that there should be far greater involvement of Council staff in Council policy making.

Labour believes that the public has a right of access to their local council. Council business should be conducted in public and in the public interest.

Above all, Labour Councillors are good public representatives, committed to serving the local people.

The reform of local government and the replacement of the present national government begin on June 11th by voting for Labour candidates in the local elections.

"Local 2004: Sinn Fein","Delivering real change

The Local Elections of 2004 are taking place at an important time in Irish politics.

The peace process is in grave difficulty. The Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people in a referendum just a year before the last Local Elections, has yet to be implemented. Sinn Féin has not been distracted by pre-election efforts of our political opponents to falsely place all the responsibility for the current difficulties on our shoulders. Instead we have continued with the hard work of rebuilding the peace process, representing our electorate and presenting our political programme to the people throughout the 32 Counties.

With this Local Government manifesto we present another part of that programme. We base it upon the principle that local power is a democratic right. As a party committed to building an Ireland of Equals we want to see local democracy strengthened and brought closer to the people. The disempowerment of local government over the past five years has had the opposite effect.

In this manifesto we set out our proposals for the reform of local government and the strengthening of democracy at community level. This is the basis on which our new councillors on local authorities throughout the 26 Counties will work. Their task will be to maximise the benefits of local government for the people, within the limits of the present structures, while all the time striving to change those structures. Fundamental reform of local government will require action at central government level.

In 2004 we in Sinn Féin are contesting more local authority seats than ever before. Our outgoing councillors have a record of work second to none. When they are joined by our new councillors after June 11th, Sinn Féin will be in a position to bring a new dynamic to local government.

Our councillors will be part of an All-Ireland team of elected representatives who are building a new Ireland. We are working to ensure that the corruption, neglect and mismanagement of the past is replaced by energetic campaigners, fighting for quality public services including empowered local democracy, accessible healthcare, housing as a right, improved transport, affordable childcare and education as the guarantee of equal opportunities for all.

We ask you to read and endorse this manifesto and confidently request your support on 11 June.

Executive Summary

Sinn Féin supports a strong system of local government, which is accountable, democratic, properly financed and has the maximum amount of powers devolved to it.

Transforming Local Government

Sinn Féin supports a strong system of local government which is accountable, democratic, properly financed and has the maximum amount of powers devolved to it. The Government on the other hand, wants weak local government and has done everything in its power to bring this about, including:
• stripping powers from local councils in relation to waste management, planning, roads and bin charges
• giving the Environment Minister the power to abolish local authorities if they don’t do his bidding
• extending the power of unelected and unaccountable City and County Managers
• creating an ever-growing number of bodies, boards, commissions and agencies, which have at best nominal representation from elected representatives or in most cases none at all
• removing elected representatives from Health Boards
• underfunding local government

All of this has come after decades of corruption, when elected representatives abused their power for personal gain. The result has been planning chaos. Houses have been built without local amenities, transport, health and other services, while developers, builders, elected councillors and local authority officials have been allowed to make huge profits. All of this must change.

Sinn Féin has broad ranging proposals to transform local government in Ireland. structures, powers and responsibilities and the reform of local government financing.

These include new Sinn Fein’s Proposals
(1) New local government Structures, powers and responsibilities
(2) Reform of local government financing

New Structures

Sinn Féin is building for Irish unity and independence and we believe that as part of any new political arrangements we must maximise local democracy. We are proposing three tiers for local government in Ireland - regional, county and city, and district councils. These should work hand in hand with a network of community and neighbourhood councils.

Regional Councils

Sinn Féin is proposing a system of 15 Regional Councils for the island. These would play a role in regard to spatial planning, environmental protection, economic development, transport and other public sector utilities.

Agencies like the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, INI etc, would be restructured and democratised making them a part of local government rather than an unaccountable arm of central government as occurs at present. The same principle could be applied to health boards, educational agencies, the National Roads Authority and other groups.

County and City Councils

The 28 county, 5 city and 8 borough councils should have their existing powers widened especially in terms of economic development and local service provision in terms of health, education, roads, water, sewage, transport and social services.

District and Community Councils

The role of the district and community councils is to root local decision making in the community. District councils can integrate the towns and villages of Ireland into their natural hinterlands. They would take account of the reality of urbanisation and ultimately there would be no area of Ireland not covered by a district council. The boundaries of the district councils must take account of the identification of voters with a particular area rather than a skewed head count.

Democracy and accountability

If we are to have properly functioning, modern local government structures it needs to be on the basis of democracy, accountability and the expansion of powers and responsibility.

Sinn Féin supports:
• The expansion of the powers and responsibilities of local authorities including: control over education, employment, environment, health, housing and social services as well as the ability to raise tax revenue.
• Directly elected, full-time Cathaoirligh of City and County Councils who would take over many of the responsibilities which are currently held by city and county managers.
• The power to appoint a deputy Cathaoirleach from among the sitting Councillors as a possibility for local authority members.
• The Cathaoirligh consulting with local authority members in advance of exercising many of the powers of their office.
• The removal of the Minister of Environment’s power to abolish local Councils
• Appointment procedures to agencies such as Health Boards, economic development agencies and educational authorities should come under the remit of local government instead of being the spoils of office of central government.
• The setting of strict targets with set deadlines to redress the under representation of women in local government.
• Our councillors working to ensure that councils fully implement the Barcelona Declaration which they have adopted. The Declaration commits local authorities to promote disability awareness and to ensure that people with disabilites have full and equal access to facilities and resources, and that their special needs are met.

Funding Local Government

The improved services which people need and demand at local level can only be delivered through a planned programme of reform and resourcing. Local government cannot be transformed and democratic powers cannot be devolved to councils without the necessary funding.

Local government reform must involve placing local authorities on a sound and independent financial footing. The coalition Government announced a major independent review of local government funding on the 14th February 2003 but we are still awaiting the publication of its findings. It is clearly not a priority. Local government remains chronically under-funded; it is currently accounts for approximately 10% of government spending, far lower than the EU average.

Sinn Féin proposes:
• Progressive increases in the proportion of Government spending on local government to reach a target of 20% by 2009 in tandem with devolution of powers and functions
• Phasing out the outmoded model of annual budgeting and move towards multi-annual budgeting based on long-term planning at both local government and central government level.
• Local authorities having far greater autonomy in determining and democratically controlling the direction of expenditure in their respective areas
• Local government funds to be augmented by a packaging levy, similar to the plastic bag levy, to be imposed on manufacturers in order to reduce the massive amount of unnecessary packaging produced and to help fund a zero waste strategy
• Local authority commercial rates to be applied to State buildings and funds raised to be ringfenced for social housing
• A comprehensive review of the taxation system, including funding of local government, to fully determine who is and who is not paying tax and to carry out a full cost benefit analysis of the battery of tax reliefs that have been set up by successive governments; this review to be time limited, to involve wide public consultation and participation, and to formulate proposals for a truly equitable tax system

Tackling the housing crisis

Government inaction

There are 48,000 families, which is an excess of 130,000 people, on housing waiting lists in this state. There are approximately 6000 people homeless. Traveller accommodation action plans are not being implemented. Rising house prices have made the option of owning a home completely out of reach for a large proportion of people on average incomes.In 2003 house prices increased by 13.4% and 16.3% for new and second-hand houses respectively.

The housing crisis has been caused as a result of the failure of the Government to tackle uncontrolled vested interests in the private house building sector and its refusal to provide funding to local authorities for the construction of social and affordable housing.

Housing is a right

Sinn Féin is campaigning for:
• The right to adequate and appropriate housing for all to be enshrined in the Constitution.

This would oblige statutory bodies to provide adequate and appropriate housing for all of the people of this state. It represents a first step which must be followed by legislation which will bring about the progressive realisation of this right.
• Finance for local authorities to construct adequate social and affordable housing
• Creation of a National Housing Strategy and a National Housing Agency to co-ordinate all aspects of housing provision.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for: Home ownership
• Funding for a major new Social Housing Programme by local authorities as the primary response to the housing crisis
• Increasing the threshold for participation in the shared ownership and affordable housing scheme in line with inflation
• An end to excessive development levies which penalise first time buyers and are being used merely to make up for the short fall in local government funding
• Community involvement in the planning of new housing

Local authority housing
• All housing developments to be integrated and have all necessary services and infrastructure including facilities for children and young people.
• Local authorities to fulfil their responsibility to deliver adequate and appropriate housing for the communities which they represent, including the setting and implementation of targets for the elimination of housing waiting lists
• Proper maintenance and security on all local authority housing to ensure tenant safety and a well-kept housing stock to meet future needs
• All councils to have social housing building programme which take cognisance of the differing needs of different groups including single people
• Local authorities to develop a State-wide Accommodation Strategy for People with Disabilities; all local authorities to have a dedicated Access Officer employed to inspect planning applications; the Disabled Persons Housing Grant to cover 100% of the actual cost of building work and standard qualification criteria to apply throughout the State
• Local authorities to work with voluntary and State agencies to develop and implement an appropriate accommodation strategy for people who experience mental illness
• Proper security and upkeep of local authority housing complexes for the elderly. Local authorities must also ensure the facilities and amenities are provided at these complexes to allow elderly people to have a better quality of life. Implementation of measures to enable elderly people to continue living in their own home where this is their preference including making all new accommodation lifetime adaptable
• No council house to remain boarded up for more than 2 months
• Maximum usage to be made of existing derelict sites legislation to target those sitting on such sites so that this land can be used for the construction of social and affordable housing
• The use of CPO at current use value to enable local authorities to secure land for housing

Homeless
• Local Authority Homeless Action Plans to be placed on a statutory basis and for all local authorities to implement homeless action plans
• Local authorities concentrating on medium and long-term solutions for homeless people and ring fencing a proportion of their housing stock. A vast amount of money is being wasted on bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless people. Of the €39million allocated in 2002 for accommodation and related homeless services, €22.5 million of this was allocated to emergency bed and breakfast accommodation. In addition to this, all local authorities must implement traveller accommodation plans within the agreed timeframe, that is by the end of 2004

Rent
• A graduated rents discount policy as a viable alternative to the 'right-to-buy' policy, which is creating a huge diminution in local authority housing stock
• Immediate reversal of the restrictions and cutbacks in Rent Allowance announced with the Estimates, until it is possible to house all those in need of social housing
• Removal of the unrealistic €107 cap on Rent Allowance
• Statutory control of rents in the private rented sector, strengthened laws to set standards for accommodation and more resources to implement those regulations. The introduction of measures to prevent discrimination against those trying to enter the private sector based on nationality and sexual orientation
• The abolition of ground rents

Health for all is a local issue

The need for fundamental reform

Sinn Féin is campaigning for fundamental reform of our health services to remove gross inequality, reverse the legacy of under-funding and make the services more efficient and responsive to the needs of the people.

Two tier system

Under the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government, our health services are more unequal than ever. Access to a hospital bed is determined by how much money you have and not by how ill you are. We have a two-tier public/private system, with the State subsidising the private healthcare business at the expense of public patients.

Broken promises

This Government promised in 2002 to permanently end hospital waiting lists by May 2004. It was a promise they knew they would not keep and today there are some 27,000 people on hospital waiting lists. They promised to issue a further 200,000 medical cards. They have broken that promise also.

Resource failures

Despite a series of detailed reports analysing the state of the health services and despite an increased level of current spending to above the EU average, our health services still suffer from the legacy of decades of under-funding and from the present-day reality of gross inequality. The twin failures of successive governments – the failure to reform and the failure to resource – continue in 2004 only in different guises.

Hanly

This Government has presided over the increasing centralisation of health services. Under the Hanly Report they are threatening to further downgrade local hospitals and remove services such as Accident & Emergency and Maternity units.

Action to reduce the working hours of junior hospital doctors is welcome, and indeed essential, but the associated proposals in Hanly to downgrade and slash services in hospitals throughout this State are wrong and should be resisted.

We are repeatedly told that services such as A&E and maternity should be centralised in regional and national centres of excellence. Yet the communities who are expected to bear the brunt of loss of services from their hospitals are witnessing crisis situations unfolding in existing centres of excellence such as the main Dublin hospitals.

The need for democratic accountability

The FF/PD Government is also abolishing the health boards which, for all their faults, at least allowed for some democratic accountability by including elected members of local authorities.

Bureaucratic change is being implemented at the expense of accountability. Elected representatives on health boards had a minor role but they could scrutinise the delivery of health services on behalf of ordinary citizens.

The proposed creation of a Health Services Executive is an exercise in political expediency. The Government wants to shift responsibility from the Minister for Health and Children and his Department to such an Executive, which would not be directly answerable to the Dáil for its decisions. Combined with the exclusion of elected representatives from the new structures, this is a blow to democracy.

Sinn Féin’s alternative

We are calling for:
• An end to the two-tier system.
• An Irish National Health Service with care free at the point of delivery for all.
• All-Ireland co-operation in health service delivery.
• The new all-Ireland health system to be funded from general taxation in a reformed tax system.

Sinn Féin councillors will:
• Support the retention and further development of the maximum range of services at local hospitals and the provision of quality hospital care for all, regardless of income or geographic location.
• Demand restoration of services to those hospitals where units such as A&E and maternity have been closed down.
• Press for the delivery of promised primary care services.
• Campaign for the rollout of radiotherapy and other cancer treatment services to all regions.
• Demand democratic accountability and a continuing role for elected representatives in ensuring that the health service needs of people are being met.

Environment

Promoting Environmental Rights

Everyone has the right to a safe, clean and unpolluted environment. The state has a responsibility through local government to ensure that this right is upheld. Sinn Féin is committed to regaining democratic control over waste management and have stringently opposed the measures introduced by the current Government which have removed these powers from local authorities. To this end Sinn Féin TD’s introduced a Waste Management (Amendment) Bill in the Dáil in 2003, which sought to return the powers to make waste management plans to the elected members of local authorities.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for:
• A waste management policy which prioritises reducing the production of waste and an effective and comprehensive system of recycling and reusing waste materials
• A policy of ‘producer pays’ in relation to the creation of waste to target those industries and manufacturers who are responsible for the creation of the majority of waste
• Local authorities to be given a role in pollution reduction and in bringing about reductions in emissions to enable this State to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol
• Properly applied behaviour modifying carbon taxes on industry to be provided both as an incentive for industry to reduce emissions output and as a source of revenue for local authorities
• Privatisation of waste management services to be opposed
• Incineration and all attempts to impose incineration on communities against their will to be opposed
• The power to make waste management plans to be returned to local authorities
• Adequate funding to be made available to ensure full separated waste collection from all homes within the state during the period of the current Waste Management Plans
• The abolition of local authority refuse charges
• Distribution of a composting bins to all house-holds within the State. Local authorities to establish communal composting facilities for urban householders who do not have their own gardens
• Progressive and targeted phasing out of the use of landfill
• Refund depots /machines to be provided in all shopping centres and supermarkets
• Adequate funding to be made available to achieve a target of 20% renewable energy by 2010 and 50% by 2020
• The nurturing of the renewable energy industry through public and local enterprise solutions such as target linked tax incentives, lower VAT on renewable energy products and ensure that access charges to the national grid are affordable or subsidised
• All government taxes and incentives to be assessed for possible impact on the environment
• Support for local water schemes and the development of rural sewerage schemes
• The closure of Sellafield. Sinn Féin will bring the fight to close Sellafield into every local authority chamber in the state

Education – building the learning neighbourhood

The power of Education Tackling Educational Disadvantage and Inequality

In modern society education is one of the most powerful tools we have to transform the lives of individuals and the communities they come from. It is vital that the resources available to invest in education are spent wisely and equitably. Sadly this is not the case in Ireland today. There is widespread inequity and educational disadvantage.

€6.6 billion will be spent on education in the 26 Counties in 2004. The National Development Plan envisages spending another €5.350 billion on education and training between now and 2006.

While these figures seem significant they are low by international and EU comparisons meaning that educational disadvantage is prevalent in all aspects of the education system. Seven years of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats have led to:

(1) Over 500 run down school buildings;
(2) A lack of special needs teachers. Children with special education needs are still being accommodated in classes of up to 30 pupils with no specialist assistance;
(3) A 20% secondary school drop out rate;
(4) Widespread functional illiteracy, running to 24% of the adult population according to the UN Human Development Report;
(5) Huge inequalities in terms of access to and participation in third level.

This state is in the bottom seven spenders in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of primary education and the bottom nine spenders for second level education.

Denmark, Switzerland, the US, Austria and Norway all spend $6,000 or more per annum on their pupils while the coalition Government here only spends $3,000 on each pupil. Classroom sizes here are also among the highest in the OECD.

The National Economic and Social Council estimated in 2001 that 16% of the school-going population is educationally disadvantaged. This means 132,000 children are receiving a substandard education every day.

With knowledge and education seen as key to future economic development on the island the extent of educational disadvantage and the Government failure to deal with it is all the more shocking.

Sinn Fein councillors will work for:
• Streamlining of existing projects designed to tackle educational disadvantage, with the funding allowances and planning powers been centred under the remit of local government
• Provision of VEC and local authority-run breakfast and homework clubs and other similar schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage
• Increased funding and provision of early start preschool programmes for disadvantaged children
• Increased funding for back to school allowances, especially for footwear, clothing and books
• A repeal of the 37% reduction of maintenance funds for childcare centres
• A repeal of the capping of enrolment numbers on PLC courses
• A reverse in the decision to cut funding for Phase 2 of the Community Strand of the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI)
• Reducing the pupil teacher ratio in disadvantaged areas
• Increasing the proportion of the education budget allocated to tackle educational disadvantage to 15% without cutting back other services.
• Increasing the amount of third level places for mature students
• Proper funding for college expenses such as accommodation, travel, subsistence, text books etc
• Delivering broadband services and technology labs to every primary and secondary school with adequate teaching and curriculum support available to maximise the use of these resources
• Ending the chronic underfunding of the National Education Psychological Services, (NEPS).

Huge sections of the country, predominantly in rural areas, are not covered by this service at all. 57% of schools in the North West are not covered with even higher figures for the even worse for the mid-west

Development Plans & Planning

Community central to planning process

Central to Sinn Féin’s goal of an Ireland of Equals is enabling people to play a substantial role in decisions regarding the development of their own local areas and in the management of local and community resources.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for:
• Greater community involvement in the planning process as a basic starting point of all development plans
• The drafting of development plans on the principles of sustainable development
• Development plans to make the best use of existing space and buildings in urban centres by promoting increased density in towns and the regeneration of inner city areas, in order to combat suburban sprawl
• Development plans to focus on developing brown field sites
• Rural regeneration to be prioritised
• Proper and consistent implementation and enforcement of planning guidelines
• An integrated and community centred approach to all development. Housing projects to be built in conjunction with social amenities such as schools, health facilities, childcare facilities, retail outlets and an adequate , accessible and affordable local public transport infrastructure.
• The establishment of best practice guidelines on housing mix in new developments, dwelling size, size of green areas, provision of play-ground facilities and common areas and overall environmental impact
• Recognition of the right of people living in an area to build a family home in that area.
• All development plans to provide for the specific needs of young people and the elderly in terms of facilities and amenities
• Development plans promote the cultural and civic life of the community
• Planning authorities should insist that all new and all restructured commercial and public buildings be wheelchair accessible. All buildings where food and/or drink are consumed should be accessible and have a properly laid out disabled toilet
• A specific certification from a qualified member of either the Association of Building Engineers or the Royal Institute of Architechts of Ireland as to whether the plans meet universal design standards must accompany the planning application
• No grants should be paid by Government/EU agencies for publicly used buildings eg: recreation/sports centres unless such certification has been provided with the planning application. In the case of buildings with more than one storey, grants should be withheld until the lift is installed and operational
• All footpaths should be dished ie path surface and road surface exactly flush to enable those on wheels to proceed safely. Visually impaired people should have the benefit of ‘bleeped’ crossings and tactile slabs at crossings

Rural Development and Agriculture

Sinn Fein’s commitment to Rural Life

The problems facing rural communities require a radical new approach to the whole question of rural development in the state. We support the right of all citizens to equal access to public service provision and are opposed to any attempt to cut back on education, health, transport, postal service and community policing.

We will ensure that there is real decentralisation of both the public and the private sectors, and that local and regional authorities along with community representatives are given a greater say in the manner in which local programmes are administered.

Sinn Féin councillors will work alongside others to promote measures at local level that will help:
• to maintain vibrant sustainable rural communities
• to provide adequate housing and to ensure that the planning process is fair and is made to serve the interests of local people in a balanced and sustainable way
• to promote locally-based employment
• to improve access to education and training
• to encourage participation in the decision-making process
• to ensure gender balance on Rural Development bodies like LEADER and CLAR
• to promote all-Ireland integration and co-operation
• to ensure balanced regional development
• to maintain local services
• to provide broadband communications for all parts of the state

Securing a Future for Farming

Sinn Féin is committed to revitalising Irish agriculture. At national and European level we support all measures that promote the long-term sustainability of family farms.

Farmers must be given a fairer price for their produce and measures must be taken to curtail the power of the large multiples who charge consumers up to five times what they pay the farmer for food.

Farmers’ markets

Sinn Fein councillors will propose the promotion of farmers’ markets to bring food directly from the farm to the consumer to the benefit of both, where necessary making new retail developments planning approval conditional on the provision of farmers’ market facilities.

Quality products and a GM free Ireland

We see the future of farming being built on the basis of high quality food production and an expanded domestic processing sector, with a return to genuine producer co-operatives playing an enhanced role. We are also adamant that to preserve the reputation of Irish food, the entire island must remain free from Genetically Modified crops.

When elected all Sinn Féin Councillors will table a motion calling for the Council to declare itself a GM free zone.

Justice in the Community

Everyone has the right to feel safe in their homes and communities. Everyone has the right to expect the justice system to protect their security, their rights, and their dignity.

Policing for the People

Sinn Féin wants to see an all-island police service established. In the interim, we want policing services North and South that can attract widespread support from, and that are seen as an integral part of, the communities they serve. We want effective, human rights-compliant policing with local democratic accountability, shaped as a community service and imbued with that ethos.

The Gardaí have not succeeded in making working class communities safe. Many people in these communities are angry at the failure to respond effectively to growing localised crises, and the misallocation of Garda resources.

People have also lost faith in the Gardaí because of the many cases of Garda misconduct - including off-duty criminal involvement in a range of serious offences, findings of fraud in relation to Garda contracts, and revelations that Gardaí have given false evidence in Court. The perception of impunity for these misdeeds has been confirmed by the repeated failures of the present Garda Complaints Board.

The Garda Síochána has remained largely unreformed for 80 years. The time for comprehensive Garda reform is now.

Sinn Féin advocates a comprehensive Garda reform package to support the evolution of the Gardaí towards a best practice service, which can set the standard globally for efficient, effective and accountable policing with human rights at its core. If we introduce the right reforms to create such a policing service, we believe it will enjoy an unprecedented level of community confidence, support, and cooperation. That is our vision. That is the policing service Sinn Féin wants to help realise for the people of this state.

Sinn Féin’s Proposals

Establishment of a fully independent Garda Ombudsman to investigate police misconduct:

• after an open, merit-based appointment, selected on the basis of published criteria
• separate from any body charged with a Garda management function, or with a mandate to review Garda efficiency and effectiveness
• with the necessary legal powers and resources to conduct independent investigations, determine breaches of the Garda disciplinary code, refer evidence of criminality to the DPP, and to resolve complaints by assigning penalties and remedies including recommendations for disciplinary action, changes in police procedure or compensation
• with the power to investigate incidents from the past

Establishment of a Policing Board for civilian oversight:
• independent of Garda management
• representative of the community - composed of one third elected representatives, one third representatives of statutory bodies, and one third representatives from the community/voluntary sector, including at least 50% women and taking the need for other forms of social and economic representation into account
• empowered to request a report from the Garda Commissioner on any matter pertaining to policing, to monitor performance, to make recommendations on resource allocation or policy change, and to set annual strategic objectives and policing plans
• required to meet monthly and in public

Establishment of Community Policing Partnerships at Garda district level for democratic accountability:
• based on equal partnership between Gardaí and the community
• established as committees of the local authority, with membership elected by the local authority following a transparent nomination process, and a representative composition (following the same criteria as the Policing Board above)
• as a forum for dialogue and a mechanism for both Garda accountability and community cooperation
• to conduct monthly public meetings where the District Commander would present reports and answer questions
• to reflect community concerns and make recommendations, including a mechanism for members of the public to address questions to the District Superintendent

Improved deployment of Garda resources:

• a comprehensive review of Garda resource deployment, equipment, training and procedure (including the Disciplinary Code) to ensure effective best practice policing and to complete a process of modernisation – including a local public consultation component
• civilianisation of appropriate Garda administrative posts and the introduction of a dedicated traffic corps under Garda supervision to free up fully trained Gardaí for investigation and patrol duties
• collation and analysis of crime statistics at station and district level, not just at regional or divisional level
• introduction of crime and complaint pattern analysis to provide an information-led approach to policing that addresses causes as well as consequences

Effective Action on Domestic Violence

A significant percentage of violent crimes are committed in the home, by a family member, against a spouse, child or elderly parent.

Everyone has the right to safety and security in their own home. Domestic violence is not acceptable in any form. Sinn Féin supports effective action on domestic abuse in all its forms.

However domestic violence against women is a particularly pervasive problem in Irish society, affecting approximately one in five Irish women. Since children are also affected, it contributes to generational cycles of violence. It devastates at least as many lives as any other anti-social crime, or drugs, and must become a priority for the Government.

Sinn Féin supports a safety and sanctions approach. Sinn Féin local representatives will continue to call for:
• increased secure funding for local crisis and support services for women experiencing violence
• enlargement of the island network of refuges and an expansion of their capacity so that no woman in need will be turned away
• awareness raising and education around the issue of domestic and other violence against women, including the training of the Gardaí and all staff involved in the judicial process, including judges
• increased resources for family law courts to alleviate delays, and for expert reports on custody and access issues in domestic violence cases
• reinstatement of the Civil Legal Aid Private Practitioners’ Scheme to allow victims of domestic violence priority access to legal advice and representation
• amendment of the Domestic Violence Act to remove the residence requirement on barring and safety orders, which excludes some women in need of protection
• rehabilitation programmes for offenders, available on request without delay.

Tackling the Drugs Problem

Facing up to the new challenges

Drug dependence and drug crime are increasing in Irish society and are doing untold damage to users, their families and communities.

There is a pressing need to rethink the current anti-drug strategies, which aren’t working. We need to ensure that we duplicate the successes rather than the mistakes of other countries in tackling this social problem. We need drug policies based on international best practice. Not only do we question the effectiveness of the present National Drug Strategy, we question the Government’s commitment to it.

We are also concerned about Government inaction on escalating alcohol abuse and the growing cocaine problem in Dublin.

Sinn Fein has a long record of engagement with affected communities on the drugs issue, and we will continue to make it a priority.

Sinn Féin local representatives will fight for:
• The doubling of funding to the Drugs Task Forces. The current allocation is woefully inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem.
• The formulation, funding and implementation of new strategies for dealing with cocaine and crack cocaine addiction, with an emphasis on community-based pilot projects using international best practice.
• The rolling out of effective drug education in schools and communities, based on international best practice models.
• Increased priority funding of the RAPID Programme as an investment in the future, recognising that the drug problem is most acute in urban areas suffering social and economic disadvantage. Tackling disadvantage is a bottom-line requirement of effective action on drugs.
• Holistic and comprehensive approaches to providing drug treatment programmes and other services for drug users. Such services should be responsive to the diversity of individual, family and community needs, and not limited to methadone maintenance or 12 step programmes only.
• Recognition of the positive role CE schemes play as training and employment for individual drug addicts in a rehabilitation process, but also of the important social and economic contribution made to the local communities by the schemes, services and projects themselves.
• Provision of residential care so that women with children can receive addiction treatment.
• Extended fostering allowances to give greater support to extended families especially grandparents for their role providing parenting for the children of addicts.
• More resourcing for the Garda Drugs Squads within the policing budget. There also needs to be accountability and community involvement in how those resources are spent. This should happen at the Garda District level as this would make the greatest impact on the ground in communities.
• More aggressive pursuit of major drug traffickers by the state, ensuring that the bigger players are caught, tried, and receive appropriate and consistent sentences.

Enterprise and Employment

Sinn Féin envisages a society where everyone can have a dignified, productive and well-paid job and can have a fair income and better quality of life. This Government does not have the same ambition and the last year has seen them direct cuts at the most vulnerable in society particularly those on Community Employment (CE) and Jobs Initiative (JI) schemes. The much-heralded Sustaining Progress agreement represents a poor deal for workers, particularly those in low-paid jobs.

Sinn Féin believes that local government and local government representatives have a key role to play in promoting indigenous industry as a means to bring about sustainable job creation and economic development within the local authority area. In this regard it is important to recognise that the bulk of employment stems from small and medium-sized enterprises.

Sinn Féin councillors will work for:

Enterprise
• Review of functioning and management of City and County Development Boards and City and County Enterprise Boards with the objective of making them more responsive to the needs of local communities and enterprise, and with a view to making these boards increasingly accountable to reformed local authorities
• Reform of the process by which appointments to these boards are made, to increase accountability and openness.
• City and County Development Boards to place a greater emphasis on counteracting social exclusion.
• The same quantity and quality of resources made available to inward investors to be made available to indigenous enterprises.
• Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to made available to people who have been unemployed for over one year, which would act as an effective tool to assist people to set up business and move off welfare.
• Increased accessibility and relevance of enterprise supports for women travellers and minorities returning to employment.
• Funding to be made available for the establishment of community-based co-operative enterprises.
• More support for small businesses, which are often overlooked by the industrial development agencies.
• Developing new local brands. Many small businesses are not, in themselves, large enough to enter export markets. With the right guidance and support from Enterprise Ireland they could begin joint ventures to develop, produce and market products outside of Ireland. The Fuchsia Brand developed in West Cork and the Homethrown Irish pottery network are good examples of the development of a regional and national brands encompassing a number of small companies.
• Matching funds for local business. The industrial development bodies should provide the same level of support and funding for indigenous business as is currently provided to inward investment projects;
• The inclusion of penalty clauses in all agreements with companies receiving Government grants, in the event of the company pulling out.

Employment
• The immediate reinstatement of 5000 CE places and Job Initiative places which have been cut by the Government.
• Implemention of the Government’s own commitment to mainstream all funding and services for people with disabilities and the elderly, currently delivered through CE schemes.
• Redundancy payments to be increased to three weeks of pay per year of service.
• Fulfillment of the NAPS commitment to “eliminate long-term unemployment as soon as circumstances permit, but in any case not later than 2007”
• The needs of the working poor to be addressed, providing access to quality, better paid and stable jobs, enabling all workers to earn a sustainable living wage.
• Positive incentives including training, support and career guidance, rather than forcing people to accept poor quality low-paid employment
• Enabling workers to take up employment. Many people are unable to find or take up employment as a result of poor education, carer responsibilities for children or elderly family members. People with disabilities or asylum seekers also face impediments.
• Workplace safety to be made a priority
• Equal access for all to good quality childcare for all, regardless of income
• Adaptation of social protection systems to the needs of part-time workers and other atypical workers, including those caring for dependents
• Extended maternity benefit, from 18 weeks to 26 weeks
• Guaranteed social security rights for atypical workers
• A specific strategy to tackle high rates of unemployment among disabled workers
• Retention of disabled workers’ secondary benefits for a substantial period of time
• Effective supports for the public and private sector to recruit people with disabilities
• Effective enforcement mechanisms and remedies regarding the employment quota for the recruitment of people with disabilities
• Comprehensive needs assessments for people with disabilities to direct them to the appropriate service around their education, training and employment needs
• The implementation of the NESC report ‘Labour Market issues for Older Workers’ (2003)
• The right to work (and pay taxes) while asylum applications are in process.

Transport - Accessible Reliable & Public

Seven years of failure

The Department of Transport declares its objective “To ensure the provision, development and regulation of competitive, safe and secure integrated transport services and transport infrastructure for the road, rail and air transport modes in Ireland”.

The reality is a chronically under-funded public transport network, traffic gridlock in urban centres and on major national roads, billions poured into road building without any cost-benefit analysis and critically flawed proposals to break up CIE. The spending on road building is currently double the €3.5 billion earmarked for public transport.

Alongside this is the virtual absence of a rural community-based transport system. In most parts of rural Ireland private cars are the only form of transport. This has left whole communities abandoned, as well as depriving them of access to health, education and often employment opportunities. A Fianna Fail commissioned survey in 2000 found that one third of the rural population has no access to transport. Nothing has changed in the last four years of the Fianna Fail/Progressive Democrat Government to change this fact.

In January 2004, a European expert on transport revealed that this state failed every single one of 27 indicators of good transport policy. The incompetence of this Government is making a shambles out of our transport system.

A study carried out in 2000 by the UCD Economics Department found that Dublin had the third lowest average subsidy rate for urban bus services in Europe. Although investment in public transport has increased since 2000 and CIE is modernising its systems, the Government is set to break it up and model our public transport system on the disastrous, expensive and unsafe British model.

Value for Money

Sinn Féin believes we need to seriously examine whether the billions invested in road building is providing value for money. We need to know why we have to pay for the roads through taxes and then again through road tolls, to see the profits end up in the pockets of private companies. Sinn Féin believes that public transport should be a priority and opposes the needless break up of CIE. We will work for an All-Ireland transport system and transport policy, which provides quality, reliable and cheap public transport.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:

Backing the Bus
• A proper system of bus corridors and bicycle lanes in our cities and major investment in quality buses to provide extra hours and routes
• A School Bus Authority, co-ordinated at local government level in both urban and rural areas

Revaluating the roads
• An immediate evaluation of the economic and environmental impact of the massive road building programme currently under way
• Opposition to road-tolling.

Rebuilding the rail network
• The Government must commit itself to a time limited strategic investment in a public owned and run rail-network that increases capacity and quality of services on existing routes while developing proper regional rail networks.
• Investment in the Western Rail Corridor from Derry/Letterkenny to Ennis and a time limited programme for rolling out regional rail services including the Dublin Derry line.
• Implementation of an integrated ticketing policy, including LUAS, as part of our public transport strategy.
• Full integration of LUAS into Dublin bus and rail services, and extension of LUAS to West Tallaght.
• Appropriate park-and-ride facilities for DART and rail stations.

Keeping Transport Public
• Opposing the break up of Aer Rianta and any attempt to sell off Aer Lingus
• Opposing the break-up of CIE and the privatisation of Dublin Bus

All Ireland dimension

Partition has lead to the development of two transport infrastructures on the island. Sinn Fein supports complete integration of transport infrastructure including the N2/A5 route and M1/A1 routes. Partnerships such as those that exist between Translink and CIE need to be strengthened with one publicly owned transport company for the island.

Multiculturism

In a dramatically short space of time, Ireland has gone from an almost monocultural nation, to one with people of various colours, creeds and cultures. Our society is radically changing.

The response of the Government and elements of the media to this changes has left a lot to be desired. Immigrants and asylum seekers have been dehumanised and portrayed as spongers, criminals and welfare cheats. ‘Ireland of the Welcomes’ has become a thing of the past.

Sinn Féin believes that we should embrace our growing diversity as a source of strength, opportunity and economic dynamism. To do this we must begin by opposing racism, discrimination and intolerance of any kind, wherever it occurs. We must challenge the stigmatisation of non-nationals and of Irish citizens with non-national parents. The discriminatory policies of this Government must come to an end.

All Sinn Féin candidates have been through anti-racist training facilitated by the National Consultative Council on Racism and Interculturalism and have individually signed an anti-racist pledge. We are committed to a multicultural Ireland.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• The establishment of Anti-Racism Networks facilitated, resourced and supported by local councils to develop policy, co-ordinate community activity and liaise on a cross-sectoral basis.
• Increased resources for minority ethnic NGOs, as well as anti-racist organisations
• An end to the system of Direct Provision and forced dispersal of asylum seekers and its replacement by the right to work and the freedom to choose one’s place of residence
• Retaining the equal right of citizenship for all children born in Ireland
• Opposing racism in whatever form it appears in our communities
• The adoption of an anti-racist charter by all local authorities and their services.
• Campaigning for the government to reverse it policy regarding the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group and to repeal the Housing Act 2002 which criminalises Travellers
• A broader, meaningful Traveller-Settled reconciliation process, where Traveller and settled communities come into conflict

A Charter for Senior Citizens

Sinn Féin believes that creating the conditions for an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups need enhanced protection from the state.

Sinn Féin recognises that senior citizens have made a lifetime contribution to our society through their work, their taxes, rates, insurance contributions and voluntary work in their communities. We are calling for a fundamental review to examine whether the standard of living of our senior citizens meets their needs and reflects the contribution they make.

Poverty has no place in our society, yet the incomes of many senior citizens are falling radically behind that of society as a whole. Our senior citizens, many of whom have been forced to retire, are living on inadequate pensions and struggling with spiralling costs of living. They also have to battle against society’s attitudes towards those marginalized, particularly as a result of low income.

It is vital that mechanisms are developed to properly value and recognise the lifelong contribution of our senior citizens to society as a whole and to social cohesion.

While senior citizens have concerns and needs particular to their personal circumstances, their concern is also for society as a whole. The quality of life for their children and grandchildren, for the following generations, is as important to them as their own welfare.

It is essential that there is a consultation process with Senior Citizens on all issues pertaining to their and their wider community’s welfare.

Sinn Féin’s councillors will work for:
• The fundamental review of the standard of living of senior citizens, including pension provision, cost of living, fuel poverty and disposable income
• Year on year targets to eliminate unnecessary deaths from cold
• Simplification and streamlining of grants application system for adaptation work for access to basic amenities in the home
• Design of streets and roads as safe environments for senior citizens
• Introduction of free personal care
• An adequate level of nursing care in residential accommodation
• Fair access to health care for senior citizens based on clinical need
• Extension of resources available for home security
• More resources for community-based initiatives that promote social inclusion
• Free telephone line rental, free TV licenses and examination of the potential of free Internet access

A chara,

The Local Elections of 2004 are taking place at an important time in Irish politics.

The peace process is in grave difficulty as the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people in a referendum just a year before the last Local Elections, remains unimplemented. Sinn Féin has not been distracted by the pre-election efforts of our political opponents to falsely place all the responsibility for the current difficulties on our shoulders. Instead we have continued with the hard work of rebuilding the peace process, representing our electorate and presenting our political programme to the people throughout the 32 Counties.

With this Dublin manifesto we present another part of that programme. We base it upon the principle that local power is a democratic right. As a party committed to building an Ireland of Equals we want to see local democracy strengthened and brought closer to the people.

Sinn Féin is working for a capital that, like other modern Euopean cities, is a clean, safe, affordable place to live in. Our candidates have a proven track record in delivering for communities in this city, and are determined to bring about an end to the inequalities they suffer. Many of these communities have been abandoned by other parties except, of course, around election time.

Sinn Féin councillors will be part of our All-Ireland team of elected representatives who are building a new Ireland. We are working to ensure that the corruption, neglect and mismanagement of the past is replaced by energetic campaigners fighting for quality public services including empowered local democracy, accessible healthcare, housing as a right, improved transport, affordable childcare and education as the guarantee of equal opportunities for all.

On June 11th, I urge you to support our vision of a better Dublin, to help us build, in the city’s local authorities and in the European Parliament, a fair city for all.

Delivering for Dublin

Sinn Féin’s current elected representatives already make up a first class team for Dublin. Seán Crowe TD and Aengus O Snodaigh TD represent the party in Leinster House. Cllrs Christy Burke, Larry O’Toole, Dessie Ellis and Nicky Kehoe make up the voice of Irish republicanism in Dublin City Council. Cllrs Mark Daly and Cathal King represent the party on South Dublin County Council.

On June 11th, the people of Dublin have an opportunity to enhance this team’s effectiveness by electing more of the 30 candidates we are running across Dublin for the four local authorities and electing Mary Lou McDonald as Sinn Féin’s first ever MEP.

Our candidates, elected represen-

tatives and local activists make up our team for Dublin. Our TDs in Leinster House work in co-ordination with our local representatives, elected and unelected, to ensure that every Sinn Féin representative has the power to hold Government Ministers to account for their actions in his or her community.

As an MEP, Mary Lou McDonald will articulate the needs of the people of Dublin in the European Parliament, working in conjunction with our growing team at local and national level.

Our party’s National Elected Representatives Forum is unique in Irish politics, bringing elected representatives from all over the island of Ireland together to coordinate our work on behalf of the Irish people.

Sinn Féin - Delivering for Dublin, Delivering for Ireland.

The Rise of Sinn Féin in Dublin

1. Housing - A Right for All

There are over 4,000 homeless people in Dublin, an increase of 274% since the introduction of the Housing Act of 1988. The average price of a new home in Dublin is now well over €300,000 and second hand houses are at €373,000. The current housing crisis is one of the major challenges facing Dublin today. Consecutive governments, and indeed administrations in City hall, have failed to show the political will necessary to provide solutions to this problem.

Since coming to power this Government has done nothing to alleviate the problem. One of Charlie McCreevy’s first decisions was to eliminate the first-time buyers grant making it even more difficult, impossible for some families, to buy a home.

Minister Martin Cullen amended Section V of the Planning and Development Act, allowing developers to avoid building social housing. It has now reached the stage where some developers are advertising their properties as being free of social housing.

According to the latest report by Dr Peter Bacon more than 20,000 new homes will be needed in Dublin City Centre over the next nine years if population trends continue.

2. Sinn Féin, in trying to address the

crisis, introduced a bill in Leinster House to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution, receiving the support of all Opposition parties but defeated by a Government committed to opposing a rights based society. Our councillors will continue to support the campaign, which has the backing of a wide range of housing and homelessness groups.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• No council house to remain boarded up for more than 2 months
• The use of Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) at current use value, at a maximum, to enable local authorities to secure land for housing
• No sale of Council land to speculators or private developers. Surplus state and church land to be transferred to Councils to allow the building of local authority homes.
• The sale of a local authority home to an existing tenant cannot proceed without being replaced by at least one new home in local authority housing stock
• Proper maintenance and security on all local authority housing to ensure tenant safety and a well-kept housing stock to meet future needs.
• Capping of rent and increased protection for tenants in the private rented sector
• Homeless Action Plans and Traveller Accommodation Plans to be placed on a statutory basis and all local authorities to implement them
• Rehousing women who have suffered violence in the home to be a priority

3. Healthcare - From the Cradle to the Grave

This government promised in 2002 to permanently end hospital waiting lists by May 2004. It was a promise they knew they would not keep and today there are some 27,000 people on hospital waiting lists. They promised to issue a further 200,000 medical cards. They have broken that promise and in fact there are 20,000 fewer people with medical cards than there were two years ago — and hospital charges have been increased twice since then.

The less well-off in Ireland are dying because they lack access to healthcare in this state. Dr Jane Wilde of the Institute of Public Health estimated last May that almost 6,000 people die prematurely each year in Ireland simply because they are poor. This is almost 20 times the figure of road deaths every year.

The two-tier health service in this

state is not a soundbite or a slogan, it is a killer. People living in poverty are shut out of the health service.

The FF/PD Government is also abolishing the health boards which, for all their faults, allowed for some democratic accountability because they included elected members of local authorities. Bureaucratic change is being implemented at the expense of accountability.

Sinn Féin is campaigning for fundamental reform of our health services to remove gross inequality, reverse the legacy of underfunding and make the services more efficient and responsive to the needs of the people. Despite welcome increases in health spending over the last number of years investment in our health system still lags behind the EU average.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• A&E facilities for under-12s at Beaumont Hospital and retention of A&E and acute status for Loughlinstown Hospital
• Adequate funding for Tallaght and Blanchardstown Hospitals
• Democratic accountability and a continuing role for elected representatives in ensuring that the health service needs of the people are being met
• Campaigning for an All-Ireland National Health Service with care free to all at the point of delivery and an end to the twotier system
• Support for community based healthcare facilities and services

Transport - Accessible, Reliable & Public

Chronically underfunded public transport, traffic gridlock, billions poured into road building without any cost-benefit analysis and critically flawed proposals to break up CIE. Can Dubliners survive three more years of Seamus Brennan as Minister for Transport?

In January a European expert on transport, Ton Sleddens, revealed that this state failed every single one of 27 indicators of good transport policy. The incompetence of this Government is making a shambles out of our transport system.

A study carried out in 2000 by the UCD Economics Department found that Dublin had the third lowest subsidy rate for urban bus services in Europe. Although investment in public transport has increased since 2000 and CIE is modernising its systems, the Government is set to break it up and model our public transport system on the disastrous, expensive and unsafe British model.

Sinn Féin believes we need to seriously examine whether the billions invested in road building is good value for money. We need

to know why we have to pay for the roads through taxes and then again through road tolls to see the profits end up in the pockets of private companies. Sinn Féin believes that public transport should be the priority and opposes the needless break up of CIE. We will work for an All-Ireland transport system, a truly national transport policy and for quality, reliable and cheap public transport.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• Opposing the break-up of CIE and the privatisation of Dublin Bus
• A proper system of bus corridors and bicycle lanes in our cities and major investment in quality buses to provide extra hours and routes
• A School Bus Authority, coordinated at local government level in both urban and rural areas
• Implementation of an integrated ticketing policy, including LUAS, as part of our public transport strategy
• Full integration of LUAS into Dublin bus and rail services, and extension of LUAS to West Tallaght
• Appropriate park-and-ride facilities for DART and rail stations
• Opposition to road-tolling
• Opposing the break up of Aer Rianta and any attempt to sell off Aer Lingus

4. Crime and Policing Accountable and Visible

Eighty percent of Dubliners are afraid to walk the streets at night according to a recent MRBI survey in the Irish Mirror. Drug-dealing, ‘joy-riding’, robberies and assaults are concentrated in areas of Dublin deprived of resources and hardest hit by cuts.

The scourge of drugs continues to devastate working class communities across Dublin with heroin and increasing amounts of cocaine easily available. The drugs problem must be tackled by the Gardaí working in partnership with local communities as part of an overall strategy to eliminate the social deprivation that is a key cause of drugs abuse.

People have a right to live without fear in our capital. They also have a right to a police force that is accountable, and that works in partnership with the local community.

Sinn Féin has published a radical document for Garda reform, Policing for the People, which has set a benchmark for a first class policing service for the future.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• Appointment of an independent Garda Ombudsman and a civilian Policing Board independent of Garda management, including local and community representatives
• Community Policing Partnerships set up at Garda district level, elected by the local authority and representing the local community
• A review of Garda deployment and increased visibility of Gardaí on the streets
• A review of the effectiveness of the Community Gardaí involving representatives of local communities
• More resources for the Drugs Task Forces and Garda Drug Squads and the formulation of new strategies for dealing with increasing levels of cocaine and crack cocaine use
• Tackling disadvantage by providing community resources and employment as a bottom line requirement for effective action on drugs
• Comprehensive and holistic drug treatment programmes and other services that are responsive to the diversity of individual, family and community needs and not limited to methadone maintenance or 12 step programmes only

5. Planning and Development Building a City of Equals

Planning and development in Dublin are almost bywords for corruption. The legacy of crooked councillors putting brown envelopes before the needs of the people is one that haunts local government in Ireland, and in Dublin particularly. Every day the Tribunals bring us new revelations of the culture of greed and arrogance that seemed to dominate local politics in Dublin in the ‘80s and early ‘90s.

Planning in Ireland needs to be made an open and inclusive process, with the local community at the heart of the decision making process, with real powers to affect change. Developers should not merely have to pay lip service to consultation.

Central to Sinn Féin’s goal of an Ireland of Equals is enabling people to play a substantial role in decisions regarding the development of their own local areas and in the management of local and community resources. Planning can be an essential tool in tackling anti-social behaviour, but bad planning or a lack of integration in planning, creates communities devoid of social resources

Sinn Féin’s submission on the Dublin Draft Development Plan, Building a City of Equals, emphasises the need for community involvement. We are also committed to opposing changes in the retail planning guidelines which would favour massive superstores over neighbourhood and community businesses.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:

• Community involvement in the planning process as a basic starting point of all development plans and removal of the planning objection fee

• Development plans to be drafted on the principles of sustainable development and to focus on developing brown field sites

• Maintenance of the current retail planning guidelines

• Better use of green space. It should be more than merely an open field which becomes a place for anti-social elements to congregate and should meet the needs of the community

• An integrated approach to all development plans building houses in conjunction with social amenities and an adequate, accessible and affordable local public transport infrastructure

• All development plans to provide for the specific needs of young people and the elderly in terms of facilities and amenities

• Ensuring that development plans promote the cultural and civic life of the community

6. Waste Management Towards Zero Waste

The debate about waste management in Dublin during the last few years has been dominated by the issue of the Bin Charges. Sinn Féin opposed the Charges as an unjust form of double taxation that violated the principle of ‘Polluter Pays’. The real polluters are the manufacturers of unnecessary packaging and big business. Household waste amounts to less than 10% of waste.

Our councillors and activists were in the forefront of opposing the Charges and members and supporters of Sinn Féin went to prison on principle rather than pay charges they saw as unjust.

Sinn Féin has consistently opposed incineration at central and local government level. We fully understand that incineration does not contribute to the solution but only adds to the problem. We will continue to actively support communities campaigning against the imposition of hazzardous incinerators in their area.

Sinn Féin also opposed the Government’s decision to take the power to develop waste management plans from the elected representatives of the people and we continue to campaign for a return of that power to councillors.

We have published our waste management charter, Towards Zero Waste, outlining our all-Ireland strategy to combat waste and pollution; a strategy based on waste reduction, reuse and recycling. All our communities are affected by a waste crisis, all our communities will be affected by incineration and it is up to all of us to implement an environmentally sustainable response.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• The abolition of local authority refuse charges which are an unfair double tax
• Opposing incineration and all attempts to impose incineration on communities against their will
• Reopening and redeveloping the Irish Glass Bottle recycling plant in Ringsend under Council management and subsidising the development of recycling facilities in general
• Opposing privatisation of waste management services
• Returning the power to make waste management plans to local authorities
• Adequate funding to ensure full separated waste collection from all homes within Dublin during the period of the current Waste Management Plans
• Bringing the fight to close Sellafield into every local authority chamber in Dublin

7. Community Empowerment Building on Experience

Sinn Féin is committed to empowering the people of Ireland to ensure the maximum possible control of their own destinies, local economies and communities. We do not want to lead the people; we want to help the people lead themselves.

Nowhere is the Government’s contempt for community empowerment more vividly displayed than in its treatment of Community Employment Schemes. In 1997, when the Coalition Government was elected, there were just under 40,000 CE participants. In 2004, after seven years of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the number is expected to be 25,000, a reduction of almost 40%. These cutbacks have devastated community projects and services across Ireland. Home helps, meals-on-wheels, childcare, environmental and heritage projects have all suffered.

Despite the fury of local communities and their representatives, the Government went ahead with its actions and ignored the wishes of the people. Sinn Féin is committed to the empowerment of communities and citizens. We believe that the people must have greater input and control over the political process for it to be truly democratic.

One of the contributory elements to growing political apathy is the disconnection of citizens from the body politic. In our urban areas, the lack of effective local power has left whole neighbourhoods

trapped in poverty and victim to the effects of joblessness, ill health, drug abuse and crime when they should be thriving growing communities.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• Restructuring and democratisation of agencies such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to make them a part of local government and not an unaccountable arm of central government
• Giving communities more control over the management of their own estates, particularly in relation to housing allocations
• Reversal of the cuts in Community Employment schemes, whose social importance to Dublin communities has not been understood by this Government
• Support for directly elected Mayors and an end to the quangoisation of local Government
• A national debate about reforming local governance to empower communities including the possibility of instituting the right to petition for recall of councillors and initiatives

8. A Multicultural Dublin in a Multicultural Ireland

In a dramatically short space of time, Ireland has gone from an almost monocultural nation, to one where people of various colours, creeds and cultures are radically changing Irish society.

The response of the Government, and elements of the media, to these changes has left a lot to be desired. Immigrants and asylum seekers have been dehumanised or portrayed as spongers, criminals and welfare cheats. For many of Dublin’s newest arrivals, the Ireland of the Welcomes has been anything but.

As Ireland becomes a more multicultural country, the challenge is to embrace our growing diversity as a source of strength, opportunity and economic dynamism. To do this we must begin by opposing racism, discrimination and intolerance of any kind wherever it occurs. We must challenge the stigmatisation of non-nationals and of Irish citizens with non-national parents. The discriminatory policies of this Government must also come to an end.

All Sinn Féin candidates in Dublin have been through anti-racist training facilitated by the National Consultative Council on Racism and Interculturalism and have individually signed an anti-racist pledge. We are committed to a multicultural Dublin as the capital city of a multicultural Ireland.

The priorities for Sinn Féin councillors are:
• The establishment of a Dublin Anti Racism Network facilitated, resourced and supported by local councils to develop policy, co-ordinate community activity and liaise on a cross-sectoral basis.
• Increased resources for minority ethnic NGOs as well as antiracist organisations
• An end to the system of Direct Provision and forced dispersal of asylum seekers and its replacement by the right to work and the freedom to choose one’s place of residence
• Retaining the equal right of citizenship for all children born in Ireland
• Opposing racism in whatever form it appears in our communities
• The adoption of an anti racist charter by all local authorities and their services.

"EP 1999: Fine Gael","PREFACE
Fine Gael is clear about what it wants from Europe, and for Ireland, from these European elections. We set it out in Government when we launched our successful EU Presidency in 1995. We said then what we wanted for Europe.

We want peace;
We want safe streets; 
We want secure jobs; 
We want sound money;

Only the European Union is strong enough and big enough to achieve peace, safe streets, secure jobs and sound money. Individual states on their own are too small to do the job. Big multinational companies, like Microsoft now have stock values several times the size of GDP of a country like Ireland. Only within the European Union can Ireland have the clout to get good things done, or wield the clout to stop bad things being done.

If the European Union is to succeed, it must bring its people with it. The European Union must be democratic. People must see a connection between how they vote in European elections, and what happens in Brussels. The European Union must make the people feel they are part of the decision making. This is the challenge for all of us. We must have a say in our future.

First, we in Ireland must have a say in issues that determine the peace of Europe. We cannot sit on the sidelines and let others make the decisions. The issue of peace in Europe is too important to be left to others.

If we in Ireland commit ourselves to European security, we can help guarantee our own peace and security. If we do not commit ourselves, others will make the decisions, and we may have to live, or die, with the results of their decisions.

Ireland does not have an effective say in its security at the moment. Fine Gael believes that it should, and in Government we will ensure that it does.

Second, only the European Union is big enough nowadays to do all that is needed to ensure that the streets of Ireland are safe from the murderous activities of the local offshoots of international criminal gangs.

I believe that the battle against organised crime should now be made the next big project for the European Union.

Organised crime respects no boundaries. It is facilitated by the speed with which money can be moved across borders. The supply of illegal drugs is one of the main enterprises of modern crime, and it is an international enterprise. The response must be international too.

Third, we want secure jobs for Ireland, and for Europe. At a time when unemployment here has more than halved in a few years, when many employers cannot find staff and when young people from France, Spain and Belgium and elsewhere are coming here to work, it may seem odd to be worrying about job security.

The majority of Irish people have good jobs now, because we did things right in the past. We opened our markets and let in competition. We kept our business taxes low. We worked at partnership between employers and unions. We kept standards high in education, through competitive examinations.

We must preserve those advantages. Others in Europe can borrow from our example. They too can have these advantages if they choose. But we will not allow anyone in Europe to force us to adopt policies of high taxation, or rigid structures, that would take away the source of Ireland's tremendous growth today.

Fourth, we want good money that will underpin the economic stability of the European Union and its member states. The single European currency is the most visible example of European integration and co-operation but its success will depend on the EU putting in place the mechanisms that ensure buffers against currently unforeseeable future shocks and a constant commitment to driving an agenda of European competitiveness to underpin economic prosperity in the single currency area.

These are our key goals for Europe. To achieve them and to ensure that our voice is heard in this larger Europe, we must have even better MEPs than we ever had before. MEPs who will be vigilant. MEPs who will be articulate. MEPs who can make friends and exercise influence on our behalf. MEPs who are drivers, not passengers. MEPs who know what they want for Europe, and for Ireland.

INTRODUCTION

FINE GAEL: SECURING OUR FUTURE PEACE AND PROSPERITY IN EUROPE

Fine Gael is the party of Europe. We are members of the European People's Party (EPP) which brings together the European Christian Democratic parties and which is one of the two big groups in the European Parliament. Fine Gael's membership of the EPP enables us to have a real influence in forming and implementing policy beneficial to the Irish people on the European stage.

Fine Gael believes that European and Foreign Policy is an important area of public affairs. It is an area of increasing importance as Ireland's wealth, influence and stature grows on the international stage.

Fine Gael has actively sought to provide a vision of the future of the European Union (EU) which is relevant to the needs of the peoples of this continent. This was clearly demonstrated during our successful Presidency of the EU in 1996 and in particular by

John Bruton's leadership of the European Council through crucial discussions on EMU, employment and a more effective European response to international crime and drug trafficking.

The European Union faces many challenges in the period ahead. We must enlarge to include the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe. We must co-operate ever more closely in efforts to create the conditions in which economies, urban and rural, can prosper, to preserve our environment, to fight international crime and to enhance our security.

The European Union has helped provide Western Europe with peace and prosperity for forty years. Now we must ensure that it can continue to provide the framework within which the whole continent of Europe can prosper for the next forty years and beyond.

Fine Gael is committed to European integration as the best means of ensuring Ireland's, and the continent's, future peace and prosperity. In the European Parliament elections we are presenting a group of experienced and skilled candidates, capable of ensuring that our voice is heard and that Europe successfully meets the challenges ahead.

Mission Statement

Fine Gael in Ireland, and through the European Peoples Party in the EU, seeks a stable Europe, with secure jobs, safe streets and sound money

1. EUROPEAN INTEGRATION

On the continent of Europe, we must learn the lessons of history and ensure that we live side by side in peace and harmony. This is best achieved by European integration. Sixty million Europeans lost their lives in conflicts in the first half of this century. This must never happen again. Fine Gael's policy document entitled European Integration & the Amsterdam Treaty published in May 1998, sets out our position on this important issue. (Full document available from Fine Gael on request).

The conflict in Kosovo is a reminder of how instability in a relatively small part of Europe can quickly involve the entire continent. Now that the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified and the Agenda 2000 process agreed, enlargement of the Union must again gain momentum.

Fine Gael is committed to the full integration of all democracies in Europe into the EU at the earliest practicable date.

Enlargement is as much in the interest of the existing European Union States, such as Ireland, as it is in the interest of the Applicant States. Our own economic prosperity and stability can only be maintained if such prosperity and stability extends throughout Europe. Enlargement is the key pre-requisite to this happening.

In particular, Fine Gael favours convening an early Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to deal with the issues of Commission size and voting strengths in the Council of Ministers so that the enlargement process can be expedited.

2. REFORMING THE EU COMMISSION FOR INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY

The New European Commission

The European Union is at risk of a trade war with the US, whose trade deficit with Europe has doubled in the last twelve months. Trade frictions are getting into areas where political values as much as mere economics are at stake. The EU ban on hormone treated US beef has already been struck down by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and another conflict is looming over US food products that contain genetically modified ingredients. The disputes show a conflict of political philosophy between the EU and the US.

A new World Trade Round is due to start next January, and there are already wide differences opening up on issues like agriculture and labour standards. The WTO is without a Secretary-General, and the European Union is without a Commission. Meanwhile a war is taking place within a hundred miles of the EU's borders.

A world trade dispute, with increased levies on trade across the Atlantic could derail Ireland's economic growth, which depends greatly on mutual business between Europe and America. It would also disrupt Europe's defence.

One thing that Ireland could do to avert such a crisis is press to have the new European Commission, headed by Romano Prodi, take office before the end of July this year. At present, without a Commission, there is no one to take decisions for Europe. At the present rate of going, a new Commission will not take office until October or November because the European Parliament has decided to tie up its July session with internal formalities, and then take its annual holiday for all of August.

Fine Gael believes that we cannot afford to wait until October to have a Commission in office. We are committed to having the Parliament undertake extended sittings in July, if necessary at weekends to guarantee the appointment of a new European Commission before the summer break. This is the right thing to do for Europe, and it will show that Europe is prepared to give some leadership in the world at a time of great uncertainty.

Fine Gael believes that the European Commission needs to be reformed. The need for reform has become much more apparent in light of the damning report by the Committee of Experts.

However criticism of the Commission must be seen in context:
• 80% of fraud related to the work of the Commission occurs in the Member States themselves.
• the Commission needs resources to ensure effective management and to oversee the implementation of all the funds at its disposal (the Commission has half the staff employed in the UK Department of Trade and Finance).
• many parts of the Commission are run extremely effectively and competently, and have no hint of nepotism, cronyism, or fraudulent behaviour.
• if the standards applied by the European Parliament and its Committee of Experts to the European Commission were to be applied in Ireland, the entire government that presided over the frauds and favouritism in the EU supported beef industry, disclosed in the Beef Tribunal Report, would have had to resign.

In this light, Fine Gael:
• proposes that individual Commissioners should have greater accountability to the European Parliament for their actions.
• supports the provision of the necessary resources to ensure the Commission is reasonably equipped to carry out its growing array of responsibilities.
• proposes that members of the College of Commissioners should appear before national parliaments or national cross-party Committees on European Affairs on a regular basis. Such appearances would be supplementary to their appearances at the European Parliament.
• Fine Gael insists on the principle of one Commissioner per Member State. In the event that the number of Commissioners rises to 27 or more some commentators have questioned what the role for so many Commissioners would be. If Commissioners have direct access to National Parliaments they could play a greater role in ensuring openness and transparency in EU decision making. More of the time of Commissioners should be dedicated to this task, which in turn will bring the EU closer to the citizen.
• proposes that members of the European Court of Auditors appear at National Parliamentary Committees, for the same reasons as outlined above in relation to Commissioners.
• proposes that consideration be given to a new procedure whereby the President of the Commission would be elected by the European Parliament.

Benefits:
• this would bring Commissioners (and Auditors) closer to the people of the Member States, breaking down the ivory-tower syndrome.
• allow the Commissioners to address people's concerns more directly, via the parliament/committee.
• provide the Commissioners with first hand experience of the Member State's workings, personnel and positions.
• improve the democratic accountability of the new Commission.

3. EMU
The single currency brings significant benefits to members (including Ireland).
• It cuts transaction costs for imports and exports. Between them, they represent present 195% of Irish GNP so even small savings can yield very real benefits.
• It cuts the costs funding investment by business and individual alike.
• It gives Irish business far more competitive access to European markets.

However, it also removes exchange rate policy and interest rate policy from the government armoury in dealing with economic problems. This loss would be most felt in the event of a significant shock that affected one member state in particular and knocked it out of step with others. In such circumstances, described in the jargon as an ""asymmetrical shock"", a country could face a currency value and monetary stance that magnified the shock rather than reduced it. It would precipitate a more severe loss of income and employment in the country affected, as it could not fall back on devaluation or monetary policy to assist in the necessary adjustment in its demand and cost structures.

Among the members of the EMU Ireland is clearly more vulnerable to problems of this nature by virtue of the fact that the UK, our largest single trading partner, remains outside the system. A sharp devaluation in sterling would be one such ""asymmetric shock"".

Within a single country, when a region suffers a reversal, the tax and transfer systems automatically respond to channel resources into the region under pressure. There is no similar mechanism of transfer among the EMU members. Europe needs to anticipate this sort of problem before a crisis occurs for some members, which could jeopardise the credibility of the entire regime.

Fine Gael believes that the EU must respond on two fronts:
1. by establishing a buffer mechanism which helps members adjust to such shocks
2. by promoting a competitiveness agenda within member states that can ensure members anticipate and minimise potential pressures.

The first of these must be negotiated within Europe. It could be established initially on

the insurance principle where members pay a premium into a fund which would make pay outs in specified circumstances. The EU Budget would need to underwrite the system in the early years but over time it could become self-sufficient. In the longer term, the EU needs to develop revenue sharing mechanisms in relation to funding certain economic infrastructures to underpin the strength of the single currency area. This system would give Europe a direct policy instrument to deal with the potential shocks to the system.

The EU should also take the initiative in developing and monitoring a competitiveness agenda among Member States to underpin economic prosperity in the single currency area. There is ample evidence that the EU is weak in crucial areas that will determine long term competitiveness. These include innovation and new product development, the application of information technology and facilitation of e-commerce, access to risk capital, and adaptability in managing change at enterprise level B to mention just a view.

Ireland too is weak in these areas. We in Europe must be competitive in these areas if we want to steadily improve employment and living standards in a single currency area.

Fine Gael will press for a European Competitiveness Initiative that would involve:
• setting shared high level goals on competitiveness across all members
• developing key elements of a strategy to pursue these goals and associated policy guidelines
• obtaining a commitment from each member state to develop a competitiveness action plan of its own
• monitoring by the Industrial Council of this process.

By acting in consort, member states can reinforce the mutual benefits of the common currency area and strengthen Europe’s overall economic position. Ireland should play a lead role in promoting these long-term strategies to underpin the mutual success of the EMU instead of seeing Europe only as a source of handouts.

Our Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Gay Mitchell TD acting as Rapporteur for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs, authored a report on Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a project to which Fine Gael has long been committed for some time. Fine Gael endorses this report and in particular its recommendations that:
1. The proposed six months of dual currencies (January-June 2002) be shortened to perhaps two months starting on 1 February, 2002. In this way the winter sales would be over and also a shorter ""dual period"" would be less confusing for consumers and less expensive for retailers. The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach should report back to the Oireachtas on their efforts with ECOFIN and the European Council in this regard.
2. The Department of Finance lay a report on the continuing implications for the Irish economy of the Stability and Growth Pact before the Oireachtas twice annually, before any such report is submitted to European institutions.
3. The Director of Consumer Affairs should be authorised, and funded, to appoint a ""Yell and Tell"" Consumer Representative in each Euro-Parliamentary constituency on a modest fee, free-lance basis during the changeover period.
4. The Director of Consumer Affairs pay particular attention to money-lending practices and how interest rates are applied by moneylenders, to ensure that poorer persons are not further exploited in terms of interest charges.
5. FORFAS and IBEC intensify their efforts to educate employees and customers in advance about issues surrounding the Euro, encouraging companies and helping to design specific programmes.
6. The campaign of FORFAS and the Euro Changeover Board be re-examined so as to ensure that SME's are targeted for special assistance towards preparation for EMU.
7. The Director of Consumer Affairs publish details of her intentions in relation to assistance to SME's, especially under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, as soon as possible.
8. FORFAS and the Euro Changeover Board give careful consideration to ways and means of assisting sectors of industry to change to Euro invoicing together where practicable.
9. The Communicating Europe Task Force be again chaired by a Minister of State, as was the norm before its transfer to the Department of Foreign Affairs, and that the Task Force report on its activities twice annually to the Houses of the Oireachtas.
10. Sterling devaluation could cause serious problems for Irish indigenous industry. Therefore a special strategy must be put in place to provide for such a possible eventuality. The Minister for Finance should lay plans for such a strategy before both Houses of the Oireachtas.
11.Anticipating future budget surpluses and a forecasted debt/GNP ratio of about 30% in the first 5 years of the new century, it would not seem prudent to apply forecasted surpluses to simply reducing Government indebtedness. This is particularly true when wise investment in housing, and other infrastructure, is badly needed. Therefore, part of the forecasted annual budget surpluses should be allocated to investment in much needed additional infrastructure, such investment to be structured in such a way as to attract private partnership cofunding, so enabling more projects to be undertaken.
12. Consideration be given to setting specified increased local authority housebuilding quotas, and financing this in part out of forecasted budget surpluses, accompanied, where appropriate, by upgraded infrastructure such as roads, rail, etc. This would help efforts to negotiate a successor to Partnership 2000 and ensure that moderate wage demands would continue to assist Ireland in meeting EMU criteria.
13.Consideration be given to the creation of a National Contingency Fund, into which part of the forecasted future budget surpluses be paid to provide for possible unforeseen events arising from EMU.
14. The ESRI be asked to undertake further studies on how income flexibility to cope with economic shocks can be extended in the private sector and implemented in the public sector. (Full report available from Fine Gael on request).

4. INFRASTRUCTURAL INVESTMENT

In recent years Ireland has relied on European funds to enable us to make the necessary investment in infrastructure to bring Irish infrastructure up to the European norm.

The outcome of the recent negotiations on structural and cohesion funds has fallen far short of expectations and the Irish exchequer will have to make up a very significant shortfall to compensate for the reduction in Euro funding.

The National Development Plan 2000 - 2006 , which is currently under preparation, must take account of the regionalisation of the country which has been accepted by the European Commission. Under the new arrangements the bulk of future structural funding will be concentrated in the Objective One region.

Fine Gael is committed to the eliminating the infrastructural deficit. The key priority areas for infrastructural investment have already been identified by the ESRI whose recent study clearly shows the huge challenge facing us if our economic success is to be maintained. The crucial target areas over the next seven years must include:
• Housing
• Transport and environmental structures
• Training and research
• Telecommunications and energy
• Local and rural development

To address these bottlenecks, Fine Gael is committed to doubling the capital budget for infrastructure over the next three years.
Fine Gael is also committed to public/private partnerships to provide infrastructure. In this way the shortfall in Euro funds can be made up by the private sector.
Fine Gael favours the establishment of a Public Accounts Committee in the European Parliament. This committee will be charged, not only with the elimination of fraud, but will carry out value for money audits on selected European spending programmes across the community.
Fine Gael MEPs will be diligent in ensuring that all European monies are spent for the purposes for which they were allocated. In particular, they will ensure that monies allocated to Objective 1 areas will be spent on projects within these areas.
Fine Gael MEPs will ensure that special programmes are drawn up to cater for the needs of the many rural and urban poverty black spots outside of the Objective 1 areas.

5. EUROPEAN SECURITY

At the heart of the European ideal is the concept of economic, social and political solidarity. Political solidarity will increasingly raise the question of European security co-operation.

The ultimate decision on Irish involvement in European Union security structures involving mutual defence obligations would lie with the Irish people in a referendum, following the passing of the Amsterdam Treaty.
We must be prepared to openly debate the issue of European security co-operation. We cannot continue to demand that other EU States show economic solidarity with us if we refuse to even discuss solidarity with them on security issues.
The Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty both refer to the Western European Union (WEU) as an integral part of the evolving role of the European Union. There are calls from many quarters for Europe to take on more of a security role and to be less dependent on American influence. It may well be that the transfer of policy decision making on Petersburg Tasks from the WEU to the EU which occurred with the passing of the Amsterdam Treaty may preface a further integration of the WEU into the EU.

Fine Gael believes that Ireland needs to play an active role in the emerging debate on European security. Consideration should be given to a closer EU/WEU relationship but with the Article V mutual defence obligations of the WEU being refined so as to become a protocol which countries like Ireland could opt in or opt out of.

In this way we could co-operate on vital humanitarian missions but retain the right for the Irish people through their elected representatives in the Oireachtas to decide on each issue on a case by case basis.
The rules for EMU have been set by those who wished to join. Future EMU members will have to take on the responsibilities of membership under rules and regulations already in place. If EU/WEU merger goes ahead a similar set of circumstances will apply i.e. those eventually joining (presumably most or all States) will take on the rules agreed. It therefore seems preferable for Ireland to participate in the rule making from the outset by seeking an Article V protocol which would maximise our future control of decision making. This would allow us to continue to exercise options which would not otherwise be available to full members.

European security co-operation is vital to our future well being and Fine Gael believes Ireland must play an active and constructive role in a debate now ongoing on the shape of future European security co-operation.

Peacekeeping - The EU and the UN
Fine Gael believes that Ireland should be to the forefront in pressing our European Colleagues towards the development of a European Peacekeeping Policy. Any such policy must seek to re-establish the importance and role of the United Nations in all decisions involving the deployment of troops for peacekeeping purposes. This will mean that all members of the United Nations will once again have a very important role to play in peacekeeping and that such decisions will not be left to the major powers. An essential part of restoring the authority of the United Nations will of course involve the restructuring of the membership of the Security Council and the elimination of the veto.

If the European Union succeeds in this pioneering role then serious consideration should be given to the European Union having a seat at the Security Council.

6. PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE (PFP)

In January 1998, Fine Gael became the first party to publish a policy document

advocating membership of Partnership for Peace, entitled Ireland and the Partnership for Peace Initiative - Our Place in the new European Security Architecture. The document argued cogently for Ireland to join PFP. This was at first resisted by the Government which now claims to be initiating a debate on the issue. This debate has long since been initiated and Fine Gael is the only party to have clearly set out its position on this important issue.

PFP is a programme of military and security co-operation between Nato and non-Nato countries. With 44 states participating it is now the most extensive and intensive programme of military and security co-operation in the world.

The 44 participating states include the 19 Nato members and practically all of the members of the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe (0SCE). It has at its heart an unprecedented ethic of flexibility which allows it encompass a broad range of participants with a wide variety of motives for membership. It is built on the principle of voluntary commitment where each state decides for itself the level and a nature of its participation.

PFP is a flexible arrangement within which Ireland could choose its own programme of work and which involves no mutual defence obligations.

Among the reasons why we should join PFP now are:
• Our extensive peace-keeping experience which is disproportionate to our size can be shared in a structured way with other States.
• We in turn can learn in a structured way from the experience of other States.
• Membership of PFP would, therefore, create an outward-looking perspective, keep our defence forces in a modern mode and boost defence force morale.
• Ireland should not set a precedent of splendid isolation, if other states followed our example instability in Europe could ensue.
• Membership of PFP does not affect our tradition of military neutrality, as is evidenced by the PFP role of Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and even Russia.
• There would be opportunity for greater North-South co-operation.
• There would be opportunity for greater East-West, British-Irish co-operation, building on the strong foundations of Air Corp/Naval Service-RAF search and rescue practice. The co-operation of neutral Sweden, and NATO member Norway, both of whom are in PFP, shows how neutral or non-aligned and aligned neighbours can co-operate.
• Increasingly, international strife is of an internal nature (in such as former Yugoslavia and Algeria) and requires a new response. Humanitarian aid, for example, can be distributed only where there is security, stability and good order. PFP participation can help maximise our capacity to assist in situations of this kind.
• Training to counteract illegal drugs importation could be written into any PFP Agreement. As an Island state this could bring many benefits in dealing with the drugs epidemic.
• It demonstrates to our EU Partners and the wider International Community that we are prepared to play an active role in the evolving post-Cold War European security architecture, and helps establish our credentials for influencing this evolution.
• PFP is a mutual agreement. We agree the role we want and this is designed to suit our particular circumstances. PFP is not a one fit suit which states must wear.

No cogent argument, based on sustainable principles has been put forward which supports not joining PFP. (Full document available from Fine Gael on request)

From 1st May 1999 the Amsterdam Treaty takes effect. This includes provisions for the EU to give policy direction to the WEU in Petersberg Tasks (humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management on a case by case basis, including peace enforcement). Membership of PFP will help Ireland play a full part in these tasks should we choose to do so.

Fine Gael favours appointing an Ambassador to NATO now, this will arise in any event when we join PFP. Our Ambassador to NATO could raise directly with that organisation our views on e.g. the situation in Kosovo. All European neutrals, except Ireland, have Ambassadors to NATO. Our intentions in relation to PFP should be open, transparent and clear so that the public know precisely what the implications of membership entail.

7. IRISH GOVERNMENT SECURITY COUNCIL

The Government's handling of the Partnership for Peace issue was appalling and, the response of the Government to the recent Kosovo crisis was meagre and unacceptable. Fianna Fail led Governments seem to believe that Ireland should not participate in security issues, unless it is somehow to our advantage. This is not reconcilable with our campaign for a seat on the U.N. Security Council. Ireland has an honourable tradition in, for example, peacekeeping. We therefore have a contribution to make in relation to European and other security issues.

In order to prepare us for this role Fine Gael proposes the creation of an Irish Government Security Council. This Council would include the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Irish Ambassadors to: the OSCE, the UN in Geneva and the UN in New York, the Council of Europe, the EU, the WEU and NATO (when appointed).

This Council should meet on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and should advise the Government on a more pro-active role for Ireland in foreign policy security issues generally.

8. CONVENTION ON SAFETY OF UN PERSONNEL
Seventy-five Irish persons have died while serving abroad with the UN. The United Nations Safety of Personnel (and Punishment of Offenders) Bill 1999, published by Fine Gael in January 1999, seeks to bring about the passing into law of the Convention on the Safety of UN Personnel and Related Persons. This Convention became international law on 15 January 1999 when New Zealand became the 22nd State to accede to the Convention. However, the Convention applies to those 22 countries only. At present these 22 States can hold those who attack UN (including Irish) personnel accountable. Ireland cannot do so until we accede to the Convention. That we have not done so to date is an outrage.

Ireland should not only immediately ratify this Convention, we should be putting pressure on other countries to do likewise. Ireland has a distinguished history in peacekeeping with the United Nations. We have the largest battalion for the longest period of time serving in the Lebanon (UNIFIL). It is extraordinary that we have not signed into law this Convention, especially given that seventy-five Irish persons have died while serving the cause of peace abroad.

Fine Gael will not only seek the passing of its Private Members Bill, it will also seek a commitment from the Government that they will report annually to the Oireachtas on all Conventions that Ireland has signed but has not ratified. Such a report would include the reasons why the Conventions have not yet been ratified and a timeframe for likely ratification.

With Ireland's role in security issues evolving it is important that legislation of this kind is passed without delay. (Full document available from Fine Gael on request).

9. AGRICULTURE

Fine Gael believes that Irish agriculture is at a crossroads, morale is low amongst many farmers, very few young people are taking up farming as a career and in general there has been a massive reduction in many farmers incomes over the past few years.

Fine Gael believes there are a number of structural changes that must take place in the industry before Irish farm produce can attract premium prices in top value European Union markets.

Fine Gael believes that much better incentives are needed to attract young farmers into agriculture. At the moment the Farm Installation Aid Grant for young farmers at , 5,600 is paid at the same level as it was in 1984/85. Fine Gael proposes to raise this to ,12,000 and to introduce a new 10-year low interest loan for suitably qualified young farmers.

We believe that a major shake-up of the beef industry is required:
1. Massive breeding programme required to upgrade the quality of Irish beef.
2. Outlaw flat pricing at factories thus providing an incentive to breed and sell better quality beef.
3. Encourage the Producer Group concept to form a special relationship with the processor, the meat retailer and the consumer.
4. Actively pursue the opening of the live cattle trade to third world countries and to ensure that there are adequate shipping facilities for the live export of weanlings to the Continent.
5. Remove as far as possible the over arching bureaucracy that is now part and parcel of applications for headage grants etc.
6. Investment in the modernization of meat processing facilities to be linked to increased market shares on EU markets for Irish beef.
7. Strengthen the role of An Bord Bia to promote aggressively Irish beef, lamb and pigmeat abroad.
8. Irish consumers should be protected against overcharging for beef lamb and pigmeat given the low prices Irish farmers receive for their stock.
9. Fine Gael believes that if the meat processing plants want to organize into a more competitive sector they should do so given the acknowledged over killing capacity there is in Ireland but with one proviso - that the cost of this rationalization should not under any set of circumstances fall back on the farmers of Ireland.

Fine Gael supports environmentally friendly farming practices and strongly endorses the REPS concept of farming.

Fine Gael believes that the Minister for Agriculture has let down the sheep industry at the Agenda 2000 negotiations. Sheep farming may not be as attractive under Agenda 2000 because of the fact that sheep do not qualify for extensification payments and because the lower lamb price in Ireland is not adequately compensated for by the Ewe Premium Scheme.

Fine Gael will endeavor to have the Ewe Premium Scheme reflect the lower Irish lamb prices. Fine Gael will also seek a review of the EU Sheep Policy during the first six months of Agenda 2000 and to ascertain the effects of the Beef Policy on sheep prices.

Similarly the cereal sector was badly let down during the Agenda 2000 negotiations. Cereal growers are likely to lose ,122 million over the period 200-2006. Other countries managed to negotiate special concessions specific to their particular requirements such as increases in Reference Yield which is used to calculate arable aid payments whilst other countries received a grain drying subsidy. Ireland's 16,000 cereal farmers were badly treated.

Many dairy farmers are bitterly disappointed that the Minister did not make an issue out of the Butter fat reference matter at the Agenda 2000 negotiations. Due to historical reasons Irish butter fat content was well below the average E.U. levels when milk quotas were established. However, due to better feeding and breeding of the dairy herd our butter fat level has now increased and farmers are now being penalized by reductions in quotas as a result. Fine Gael will actively pursue at EU level the legitimate concerns of Irish dairy farmers on the butter fat issue.

Fine Gael is unhappy with the current EU National Labelling Policy. Countries like France and Germany (our main markets) have enthusiastically adopted National Labelling which has had the effect of re-nationalizing the EU beef market. The 1992 Single Market clearly guarantees right of access for goods and services in all EU Member States and confers equal rights in regards to promotion and sale of products within the EU Consequently Irish beef exports to the continent have been subjected to unfair competition since the National Labelling system became operative.

Fine Gael will seek major changes in EU labelling policy. Such changes will include the elimination of National labelling to be replaced by farm or district labelling.

Fine Gael believes that rural development was not seriously addressed under Agenda 2000. The importance of creating job opportunities in rural areas to offset the flight from the land cannot be over emphasized.

The Government promise of a White Paper on Rural Development has not been delivered on. Fine Gael calls on the government to publish this document now.

Fine Gael believes that there should be a Control of Farmyard Pollution and a Dairy Hygiene Scheme in operation.

10. EU PASSPORTS - FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT

In relation to the Schengen Agreement and travel within the European Union without passports, Fine Gael believes that it is anomalous that associated countries such as Norway and Iceland will have greater access to European Union countries than Member States like Britain or Ireland. The Fine Gael led Government negotiated an opt in clause in relation to these provisions but it is not possible to take up this option without losing our Common Travel Area with Britain while Britain remains outside the Schengen area.

Many Irish citizens resent showing a passport when travelling in the European Union as they are citizens of the Union. Accordingly, Fine Gael strongly recommends that negotiations take place with the European Commission with a view to allowing travel within the European Union for Irish citizens on a lesser document than a passport, for example a driving licence or social security card (with picture) as an interim measure while awaiting full access to the Schengen area in tandem with Britain.

This would not necessitate the introduction of an identity card system in Ireland. An acceptable and recognised document for certain purposes here would act as an identity card for travel within the EU, and entire Schengen related area, including Norway and Iceland, if the Fine Gael proposal is implemented.

11. THE FIGHT AGAINST ORGANISED CRIME

Increasing globilisation of trade, economic interdependence and the rapid development of technology has now reached a scale which was not anticipated even a decade ago. The modern organised criminal has adapted to these developments and has access to vast amounts of financial resources and makes use of the very latest technologies. Crime does not respect borders. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the rate of crime and in the scope and sophistication of organised crime. Ruthless drugs barons prey on the weak and vulnerable in every state of the European Union, including Ireland.

As Taoiseach and President of the European Council in 1996, John Bruton laid particular emphasis on the fight against drug trafficking and abuse and against organised crime. New initiatives to energise Europe's response to organised crime and drug trafficking were agreed under his Presidency.

The Amsterdam Treaty established and reinforced police, customs and judicial cooperation in the fight against drugs, organised crime and trafficking in people.

As a result of measures introduced by Fine Gael in government, the Gardai have been given extra powers to combat the drugs menace in Ireland. However, Fine Gael believes that much still needs to be done at European Union level to combat and defeat the threat to society posed by organised crime and drug trafficking. Organised crime respects no boundaries. It is facilitated by the speed with which money can be moved across borders. The supply of illegal drugs is one of the main enterprises of modern crime, and it is an international enterprise. The response must be international too.

Our priorities include:
• The establishment of a European-wide Criminal Assets Bureau (ECAB). This would be based on the model introduced by Fine Gael in Government to target organised crime and particularly the movement of the illegal proceeds of crime between Member States
• Strengthening the remit and resources of Europol. In particular, the Europol Convention must be ratified at the earliest possible date.
• The problems of organised crime are not confined to EU member states. Fine Gael believes that there is a need for greater co-operation between the EU and all other European countries, particularly the Central and Eastern European states. The EU should assist them to improve their policing judicial systems. This would enable them to move to tackle organised crime more effectively. This process was begun under Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and further development would allow for the strengthening of police intelligence co-operation between the European Union and those states which are seeking membership of the EU.
• The degree of differences in national laws and practices on serious crime within the EU needs to be addressed . Fine Gael believes that the national legal penalties for transnational crimes should be harmonised within the EU states. In particular, Fine Gael believes that all courts in the EU must, by it their sentencing policy, send out a very clear message that every form of drug smuggling and trafficking will be severely punished.

12. THE TREATMENT OF REFUGEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERS

Fine Gael condemns the Government's slow response to the humanitarian crisis in the Balkans and the Government's failure to arrange more speedily the airlift of Kosovan refugees to Ireland.
Based on the principle of international solidarity, Fine Gael is committed to the Geneva Convention on Refugees and supports the introduction of common EU laws and procedures on this issue as a matter of urgency.
A just and fair policy towards asylum seekers is at the heart of Fine Gael policy, this includes wanting to see each EU state accept a fair proportion of refugees so as to ensure fairer burden - sharing.
Fine Gael believes that the fair procedures must be in place when assessing each case. This must include access to translation, legal representation and a judicial hearing for asylum seekers. The prohibition of refoulement as set out in the Geneva Convention must be upheld. Furthermore, applicants must be processed as quickly as possible and asylum seekers should be granted a work permit if their application has not been decided within six months.
According to recent research, up to 400,000 people a year are smuggled into the European Union. Smuggling people into the EU is a business worth between $3-4 billion a year, much of this finding its way to the pockets of a well organised Mafia. Those who are smuggled are, in the main, victims, who often suffer at the hands of the smugglers.

Accordingly, Fine Gael proposes that penalties for human trafficking should be severe and should be harmonised across the European Union.

13. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

Fine Gael believes that the protection of our environment should be a central object of both the European Union and national governments. In this era of unprecedented prosperity in our country, we have a huge responsibility to ensure that our economy grows in a sustainable way. We must protect our landscape, air and seas for future generations.
We believe that, because pollution does not respect national boundaries, the European Union has a crucial role to play the in legislating in this area. We also believe that Ireland has much to learn from other European countries, many of which have very advanced public participation in waste recycling and other environmental initiatives.
We are concerned that the Government has failed to implement a number of important EU directives, including those aimed at regulating environmental impact assessments and at protecting groundwater quality.

Our main objectives include:
• The establishment of a Ministry for the Environment and Sustainable Development, or a ""Green Ministry"". This would help to raise public awareness of environmental issues.
• A strategic approach to waste management with priority given to recycling, recovery and reduction policies.
• The strict enforcement of the Litter Act 1997 in order to eliminate litter from our landscape.
• Opposition to the Sellafield plant and in particular to any expansion of its activities.
• An enhanced programme of incentives for both providers and consumers so that the full potential of renewable energy could be realised.

With regard to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), Fine Gael recognises the need for informed public debate. We believe that the Irish public are right to question developments in cases where insufficient information is available.

In relation to the GMO issue Fine Gael:
• Wants strictly regulated and supervised research.
• Insists that each genetically modified product/innovation should be evaluated on a case by case basis.
• Believes there should be a moratorium postponing the commercial planting of genetically modified crops until a full debate has taken place.
• Demands genuine and enforceable public information and clear labelling for consumers.
• Criticises the Government for failing to promote a real national debate on his important issue.
• Fine Gael will pursue this issue at National and European levels.

14. CONSUMER PROTECTION

The European Union has enacted a wide range of consumer protection legislation.

However, Irish consumers do not always get a good deal, and they do not yet have sufficient protection against fraudulent or negligent suppliers of goods and/or services. Recent examples such as overcharging of customers by the banks and supermarkets have served to underline the consumer's vulnerability.

Fine Gael believes that the Director of Consumer Affairs must be given additional resources and powers to copper-fasten consumer rights and to speedily and thoroughly investigate all cases referred to that Office.

15. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS
The period since the last European elections in 1994 has seen the emergence of a flourishing network of community based local development initiatives throughout the country.

Fine Gael in Government extended the local development areas, both urban and rural, from 11 to 35 areas throughout the country. These local development groups have restored local confidence, brought training opportunities and helped create literally thousands of jobs.

These groups continue to have a vital role to play and Fine Gael believes the Irish Government must make up any shortfall in funding arising from the new European funding arrangement so as to ensure that, in the context of the reform of Local Government, these local community groups have their place in the new structures.

Local development partnership companies are publicly funded and Fine Gael wishes to see procedures for making these partnership companies more publicly accountable without taking from their community-based role.

16. HEALTH

Fine Gael supports the creation of a common European health budget to combat illnesses and diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Aids and cancer which, in almost every case, afflict the citizens of all member states equally.

In addition, Fine Gael believes that the European Union and its member governments are big enough to give the lead to mobilise the resources for health research to halt the spread of diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS that threaten the poor in the world today but could threaten all of us tomorrow.

The diseases of the Third World - pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and malaria account for 20% of the illness in the world but they only get 1% of drug research budgets. There is no money to be made by researching these diseases because the victims, usually people in considerable poverty, do not have much spending power.

95% of AIDS sufferers live in the Third World where modern AIDS drugs and treatments cannot be afforded by almost all the victims. In poor countries AIDS is still spreading fast. The only way to halt this rapid spread of AIDS is to produce a vaccine that is cheap enough to be administered widely. There is no commercial incentive for the major pharmaceutical companies to develop this vaccine so the European Union should step in.

DISABILITY
Fine Gael ensured through the Reflection Group and the Amsterdam Treaty process that the needs of the disabled were specifically provided for.

We must now build on that Treaty provision by ensuring that legislation, directives and regulations are introduced to meet the needs and concerns of disabled persons throughout the EU. This will be a priority for our MEP's and all Fine Gael Ministers and TD's, Senators and Councillors.

17. EDUCATION

Education is the best guarantee of secure jobs.

The majority of Irish people have good jobs now because we did things right in the past. One of the most important things we did was to keep standards high in education through competitive examinations.

We cannot afford to stand still. We must preserve this advantage. Others in Europe can borrow from our example. They too can have these advantages if they choose.

Fine Gael believes that in addition to equiping citizens with the necessary working and social skills for a fulfilling life, the education systems across the European Union can play a part in broadening and deepening our understanding of our different countries and traditions.

Fine Gael is committed to the EU developing a common course in history to be taught in all European second level schools that will allow us to understand our shared European past.

Fine Gael also believes that it should be obligatory on all school students in Europe to learn at least two other European languages.

We also believe that a European University system and a European apprenticeship system, which would include study or work in another European country, should be an integral part of many courses.

18. TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT Securing Our Prosperity by Maintaining Competitive Advantage The prosperity we have been fortunate enough to enjoy in recent years is a function of both improvement in our productive capacity as a nation and outstanding performance in international trade. Fine Gael believes that a continued pursuit of competitiveness policies over the next five years is the best insurance we have of securing the prosperity we are now enjoying. This will require prudent management of the public finances and successful adherence to the disciplines. of monetary union. Fine Gael will promote both in private and public sector a constant process of innovation to effect new ways of doing business:

Innovation flows from a number of key factors:
• investment in ""human capital"" ie. education and training and R & D
• investment in public and private infrastructure e.g. transport, telecommunications, water sewerage services etc.
• having institutional flexibility and adaptability in the private and public sectors to unblock potential barriers to innovation which may exist.

Because of our relative peripherality and the quality of our ""human capital"" we are uniquely placed to harness the great potential of the so called ""information society"". Fine Gael will aggressively sell this potential to our European Partners. Fine Gael envisages opportunities for continued commercial exploitation in several fields including education, retail, financial services, international consultancies and we will ensure an awareness of this potential across industry and especially in small and medium enterprises.

EU & US RELATIONS 

Ireland has benefitted from huge investment by American owned investment companies. In Ireland today approximately 74,000 people are employed in US companies. Our growth in the pharmaceutical, computer & technology sectors is almost exclusively due to US investment. Many of our people have gained valuable jobs and experience and made new lives for themselves in the US as a result of America's positive action on behalf of Irish immigrants. Fine Gael will ensure that this investment continues by regular communication between the IDA and the investment community in the US.

It is essential that trade relations between Europe and the United States of America remain harmonious and are not damaged by recent disputes over bananas and beef.

Fine Gael proposes that there be more regular meetings - a minimum of four per year between Trade Ministers of Europe and their counterparts in the US. Such meetings can act as trouble-shooting for a to identify potential areas of conflict.

Ireland is one of the world's most open economies. Therefore, it is essential for our exporters that the next World Trade Negotiations liberalise further the markets for goods and services. Ireland needs free and fair trade.

Fine Gael supports the employment objectives adopted at the Job Summit in November 1997:
• improving employability
• developing entrepreneurship
• encouraging adaptability in businesses and their employees and
• strengthening the policies for equal opportunities

- SOCIAL FUND
Resources must be spent on Ireland's National Action Plan for Employment. As EU Social Funds reduce, essential programmes such as education, training, community-based employment and childcare must not be abandoned and Fine Gael commits itself to a greater share of national funding to ensure the continuance of these programmes.

- TRADE
We are one of the world's most open economies. Therefore, it is essential for our exporters that the next World Trade Negotiations liberalize further the markets for goods and services. Ireland needs free and fair trade.

- EMPLOYMENT
While the fall in the level of unemployment is very positive, we should not ignore the major skills and labour shortages that persist. Fine Gael is committed to training and educating our employees to all levels required whether that be third level skills or medium and low level skills. Our enterprise sector and our attractiveness for investors will suffer if such training and education is not provided.

19. MARINE

1. Fine Gael is committed in the review of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002 to ensure a Regional Fisheries Policy is in operation where each EU, state would have greater control over its own waters.
2. Fine Gael is committed to the ongoing modernisation of the White Fish Fishing Fleet.
3. Fine Gael will ensure that there is ongoing financial aid for our Irish Commercial Ports and Fishery Harbours.

20. TOURISM

Fine Gael will continue to make the strongest possible case for the continuation of substantial European funding for tourism for the following reasons:
• the need to develop major regional projects in order to tackle the serious problem of regional imbalance in tourism growth so evident in 1998;
• greater access to the regions;
• the development of programmes to extend the season;
• the continuation of environmental programmes to ensure the ongoing development of the industry;
• to tackle difficulties of access to Ireland because of our island status;
• marketing of Ireland because of our island status.

21. EUROPE AND RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

Experts now believe that the development of a computer that could be sold for just ,60 is now technically possible. But it is not being developed. Poorer families in Ireland and abroad, are thus deprived of access at home to affordable computers and to the Internet. Why?

One analyst, Nicholas Negroponte says that the development of a ,60 computer is not even on the drawing board of the big companies today because ""inexpensive computing is a crummy business. The (profit) margins are too low .""

For similar commercial reasons, little R&D is being done on measures to protect water quality, or prevent disease, in the third world. Again the reason is that short term profit margins are too low.

Individual countries, like Ireland, are too small to do anything much about this. The research budgets of individual states can hardly match those of big companies, given that Microsoft's stockmarket capital value now exceeds the GDP of Canada. But the European Union is big enough to fill this R&D gap.

The European Union can marshall the resources to promote R&D into subjects, like cheap computers, water quality and disease prevention, that commercial companies will not undertake for their own sake.

Fine Gael believes that the EU research budget should be substantially increased, provided it is focused on this sort of R&D, R&D that is socially essential but not instantly profitable commercially.

22. NORTHERN IRELAND

Fine Gael have consistently advocated a pluralist approach to reconciling differences on this island. This approach is inclusive and recognises the need for integration rather than assimilation, i.e. where different traditions complement each other by respecting their differences and learning to live side by side in harmony while maintaining the best of each tradition, rather than all merging into one assimilated group. We will continue to make peace on this island and between these islands our number one domestic, European and foreign policy concern.

In relation to the island of Ireland and European issues, Fine Gael proposes that the Irish Government and Northern Ireland Executive, when created, establish a high level group to investigate ways in which both parts of the island could more effectively cooperate on European issues. The group should include governmental and nongovernmental representatives, including business, trade union, farming and community groups. The group should invite public submissions to ensure that the widest possible range of views is heard.

The group should report within 12 months to the Taoiseach and First Minister who should then publish the report and their proposed response.

23. THE EU AND NORTH AMERICA - A ROLE FOR IRELAND

In August 1998, Fine Gael published a document titled Foundation for Transatlantic Co-operation which seeks to ensure that we build on our new-found influence in the world, helped by EU membership. As the European Union expands to the east, Ireland becomes geographically more peripheral. However, the promised closer co-operation between EU/North America (both US and Canada), opens a window of opportunity for Ireland. There are over 40 million US citizens who claim Irish ancestry and about 4 million Canadians who do likewise.

Fine Gael have argued for the creation of a Foundation for Transatlantic Co-operation to be located in Dublin, with a European, hopefully Irish, Secretary-General and a prominent north American as chairman. Ireland should be to transatlantic cooperation what Helsinki is to Security, or Geneva is to UN Conventions. Dublin should develop as the automatic centre for furthering this co-operation and we set out precisely why in our policy document. (Full document available from Fine Gael on request).

Among the projects which the foundation could initially undertake are the following:

The establishment of a transatlantic free-trade area, the development of E-Commerce and the possibility of democracy training for emerging democracies.

24. HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW

As part of the Good Friday Agreement, Human Rights issues will become more prominent on the political agenda in the coming years. Our Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Gay Mitchell T.D. has also initiated a review of human rights issues, in his capacity as Chairman of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Human Rights (a subcommittee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs). This review is almost complete and involved seeking written and oral submissions from the public and Non-Governmental Organisations. This review, due for publication shortly, will inform Fine Gael's approach to the human rights issue.

In particular, Fine Gael will give priority to tackling racism and xenophobia in Ireland and throughout the European Union.
Fine Gael wishes to see the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Human Rights become a permanent feature of the Committee system and proposes that this Committee report annually to the Oireachtas.

25. WAR CRIMINALS MUST FACE JUSTICE

A war crimes court exists to try war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, but the fact that it singles out only one region, and is not universal in its jurisdiction, makes it less likely to be accepted as a body to which, for example, a Yugoslav Government would hand over its own political leaders and citizens voluntarily. A court with universal and non-discriminating jurisdiction would more readily be accepted. The International War Crimes Court is such a body.

The only difficulty is that the Court has not yet been properly established. Setting up the Court was agreed to in Rome last year by 120 countries including Ireland. Some countries, like Israel, China and the United States, did not agree to it.

The difficulty was that these countries did not want to submit their own military to the jurisdiction of the court, unless all the countries against whom they might be in conflict were subject to it too. A proposal to give the Court the right to over-ride the rights of non-signatory states was, however, objected to by some of the same countries.

Fine Gael will pursue the setting up of this Court in such a way as to have universal application.

Fine Gael believes that it is essential that the International War Crimes Court is established as soon as possible. We will introduce a Private Members motion in the Dail to ensure immediate Irish ratification of the Court Convention.

26. OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT AID

A policy document from Fine Gael (published April 1999) is an important part of our foreign policy strategy. Entitled Concerning Our Neighbours, it sets out a number of recommendations which Fine Gael will seek to have implemented. As Ireland's role in the world evolves, we must remember our own history and be committed to sharing our resources with our least privileged neighbours, at home and abroad.

The Case for Overseas Development Assistance
The European Union and its Member States commit up to 4 billion Euros to promote aid and development in the ""South"" or ""Third World"" a year and account for between 45% and 50% of all public aid for development, compared with around 20% from the USA and 18% from Japan. The Union itself is responsible for around 15% of the total aid given by Member States, whose national interests are served by helping developing countries which both supply us with raw materials and offer markets in which to sell our products.

The EU is also a vital market for developing countries, absorbing more than 21% of their total exports.

Although much has been achieved in recent years, much more needs to be done. The statistics are frightening:
• 1.3 billion people live in abject poverty;
• 14 million die each year from easily preventable diseases;
• over 1 billion adults cannot read or write;
• the number of people living in the third world is increasing (from 70% in 1950 to 79% today, with an upward trend continuing)

Fine Gael proposes that:
• We must legislate so as to meet our UN commitment of 0.7% of GNP by 2007 (in the same way as National Debt servicing and the payment of judges are assured).
• As such legislation is the sole prerogative of the Government, Fine Gael pledges to support such legislation or to enact it in Government. As this would equate to approximately ,600 million in 2007, provisions for greater public accountability are also proposed.
• The EU Council of Ministers collectively should seek an assessment of the effectiveness of institutions such as the World Bank, and the IMF especially in relation to their impact on alleviating poverty.
• The European Union should seek the creation of a Debt Commission, to review international debt with a view to forgiving debt in countries where the burden of repayment is at such an unacceptable level as to be, for example, an infringement of human rights.
• Ireland should strive to ensure that the WTO decision making process becomes increasingly transparent, and that the WTO be fairer in trade practices, bearing in mind its inaccessibility to civil organisations concerned with trade as an economic justice issue.
• The forthcoming negotiations of the Lom  Convention should be pressed to adopt best debt development practice in relation to trade policy with the EU's Lom  partners again bearing in mind the importance of trade as an engine of development.
• The integration of children and young people in all development co-operation policies and programmes should become a priority.
• Each of Ireland's fifteen Government Departments should be asking to identify and twin with a separate developing country or region and should specialise in providing advice and/or services of assistance to that country or region, following consultations with NGOs here. Similarly, each local authority should twin with a region within a developing state with a view to providing expertise on various issues, such as, sanitation, roads, water, etc.(Full document available from Fine Gael on request).

27. EUROPEAN PEOPLES PARTY MANIFESTO - SUMMARY

Fine Gael is part of the European Peoples Party (EPP). The following are some of the main points in the EPP Europe wide manifesto:
1. The EPP is committed to a free and dynamic Europe, open to the world and living in solidarity with its neighbours.
2. We will support the important role of the family.
3. We support education as a lifelong process and a right for all citizens. In particular we will promote language learning and the study of science and technology.
4. The EPP supports increased liberalisation and deregulation within Europe as we believe it will help to achieve full employment.
5. We are committed to social inclusion and we defend a welfare society which promotes solidarity between people and between generations.
6. We support the creation of a European Environmental Union in which the importance of protecting the environment is central to all policies.
7. The EPP supports the policy of economic and social cohesion which is vital to ensure a fair spread of development.
8. We support the stability pact and the independent central bank as the best means of achieving low interest rates, greater competitiveness and more employment.
9. We favour the enlargement of the EU along with greater democratisation in southeast Europe.
10.Radical reform, including making Commissioners individually responsible for their policy areas, is required to create a more democratic and transparent EU.
11.We will promote greater judicial and security co-operation.
12.We favour the harmonisation of laws relating to asylum and immigration.
13.The EPP recognises the need to create a real EU common foreign and security policy.

"EP 1999: Sinn Fein","SINN FÉIN ON THE ROAD TO EUROPE

A chara,

This election comes at an important time both in the search for a lasting peace in ireland and the far reaching political and economic changes that are currently taking place within the european union. In these elections the people of ireland will have to decide what our priorities are for the future both in terms of a changing ireland and a changing europe.

As the only party standing candidates in all five constituencies in ireland sinn féin are working to build an inclusive, just and equal society.

We want to see a european union which is representative of its people. The european union of today is dominated by the larger states and acts in the interests of international finance. We want a european union where the aim of policy and the goals of its institutions is to improve the quality of life for people.

It is only by electing strong and hard working representatives who will stand up for ireland's rights that real and positive change will be achieved in reforming and restructuring the european union.

Sinn féin and the european union

Sinn féin recognises the european union as a key terrain for political struggle and one which we can use to advance our republican aims of national independence and economic and social justice.

We are keenly aware of the dangers for ireland as more and more decisions regarding political, economic and military matters are ceded to the unaccountable structures of the european union.

Sinn féin's position is one of engaging with the european union and its institutions in a critical manner. One of the core issues facing voters is what kind of europe we want and how best this can be achieved, particularly in relation to

Key policy areas - emu, cap, agenda 2000, regional policy, peace and reconciliation funding, the environment, and social inclusion. Sinn féin are committed to:

Working for the reform and restructuring of the european union

Decentralising of power back to national parliaments

Advancing national democracy and economic and social justice

Promoting a 32 county political and economic identity in the european union

Forging political alliances with other like minded parties and struggles in the best interests of ireland

Eu and peace process

Since the last european elections in 1994 we have seen many developments and setbacks on the road to a lasting peace settlement, in all of which sinn féin have been central. We saw the evolving of the irish peace process, two ira cessations, negotiations in 1998 leading to the signing of the good friday agreement. An agreement which was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the people of ireland.

Sinn féin committed ourselves to the full implementation of the agreement and have participated in the process in good faith. We have honoured all of our commitments. However, the last year has been one of missed opportunities and broken promises. We have seen an absence of political progress, the ongoing siege of the residents of the garvaghy road by the orange order and hundreds of attacks on the nationalist community by loyalist death squads.

The failure to establish the executive and the all ireland ministerial council is as a result of the refusal of the british government and the unionists to implement all aspects of the good friday agreement.

While much has been achieved in the last five years a lot more hard work is required. The good friday agreement needs to be implemented. Equality and justice must become a reality. Sinn féin has shown our willingness to take difficult and hard decisions and to lead from the front. We are committed to the transformation of irish society and are working to develop agreement among the people of ireland. We are confident that we can make this happen

Sinn féin is working for:

The full implementation of the good friday agreement

A lasting peace settlement

Irish unity and independence

Neutrality

Sinn féin is committed to the maintenance of positive neutrality and an independent foreign policy both in the context of a 26 county state and in a future united ireland. We are for positive neutrality in action. We have a world view, as well as a distinctly irish view. We make common cause with oppressed people throughout the world against economically and militarily powerful states.

Sinn féin believes that the nato bombing of serbia should end. Slobodan milosevic is a gross violator of human rights but the bombing of serbia is not the solution to the complex political crisis in the balkans. Instead of passive support for nato ireland should be part of the effort in the european union and in the united nations to secure a diplomatic solution.

Sinn féin believes we should:

Oppose the militarisation of the eu and the participation by ireland in military alliances eg: nato and nato led organisations - the western european union and partnership for peace (pfp)

Hold a constitutional referendum on the issue of irish neutrality

Promote european and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation.

Strengthen our unique position on the international stage as a neutral state in europe

Accountability in europe

The resignation in recent months of all of the members of the european union commission has highlighted the democratic deficit within the european union. This is just one of a complex series of institutions and power structures which have superseded national parliaments and the rights of citizens, a situation referred to as the `democratic deficit'.

Sinn féin is opposed to these undemocratic structures. We are against the

Present structure of the european union commission which is a hugely powerful and unelected executive, beyond the control of elected members. Sinn féin oppose institutions such as the european central bank which is unelected, unaccountable and unrepresentative.

The ongoing transfer of economic and political power and sovereignty from individual states to the european union is a matter of grave concern and is something we are working to reverse. Sinn féin believes:

We need a decentralisation of power within the european union

We need political institutions that are open, transparent and accountable

There must be serious reform within all eu institutions to counter the current democratic deficit

Economy

Sinn féin has been highly critical of european union economic policies and in recent years have voiced our opposition to economic monetory union and the euro. We believe emu will limit the right of irish people to control their own economy. If implemented emu will represent a backwards step with potential costs for ireland, north and south. Emu is contrary to our socialist, republican objectives of national sovereignty in political, economic and social terms.

Our vision of eu economic policy involves:

Decentralisation of power and decision making

Strenghtening social provisions

The introduction of an equitable taxation system

A campaign to combat poverty through the introduction of a minimum wage and the expansion of public sector employment

Our opposition to the emu is for the following reasons:

It will involve even further centralisation of political and economic power in a european superstate with loss of power to member states

The people of ireland will surrender control of domestic monetary policy to the european central bank

There is a complete absence of social priorities such as the need to eradicate unemployment and poverty

It will result in increased economic divergence within ireland, north and south. This will create further obstacles to our objective of developing a single, fully integrated all-ireland economy

Eu structural funds

The 26 counties will receive total structural and cohesion funds of £ 2.97 billion between the years 2000 and 2006. The six counties will receive £1.5 billion for the same period. The eu peace and reconciliation fund will receive an additional £400 million.

Sinn fein believes that the dublin and london governments have missed a great opportunity in the latest round of structural fund negotiations to maximise the benefits to the people of ireland. Sinn féin is calling for:

An all ireland dimension there is a strong argument to be made for a joint structural funds plan to develop infrastructure on a cross border basis.

An increase in spending on community initiatives community initiatives such as the leader programme actually make a difference at the basic level of society, yet they are a tiny amount of the total funding. Sinn fein believes that these programmes should make up the bulk of the funding.

Prioritising the areas and communities most disadvantaged in 1988 ireland was deemed one of the poorest regions of the european union, now in 1999 ireland is an economic success story and our gdp is at 90% of the european union average level. However across ireland many urban and rural communities are actually worse off than they were in 1988. Structural and cohesion funds should be prioritising disadvantaged areas and communities rathern than concentrating on high visibility and flagship projects.

Maximise participation allocation of european union funds is decided totally by central government in dublin and london. Control of the eu funds as with significant elements of public spending should be in the hands of empowered democratically elected regional and local government structures. The european union funds should be administered, co-ordinated and planned from the ground up.

Efficient , equitable and transparent funding mechanisms at present many of the processes of how european union funding is spent in ireland is hidden from the general public. We are calling for funding allocations in ireland to be co-ordinated and administered to avoid criminal abuses.

Safeguards for the environment the eu commission plays a huge role today in setting the criteria for funding allocations. In many cases the environmental consequences of the funding criteria are not properly taken into account. Sinn fein believes that all eu funding initiatives should environmentally assessed before any funding is allocated.

Cap reform

The recent negotiations on agenda 2000 took no action to end the inequities of the cap. There was no recognition of the problems facing small farmers and there was little to assist the almost 5,000 people who are leaving farming annually or indeed those farmers throughout ireland who are facing collapsing incomes

Sinn fein proposes:

Real reform of the cap. The original objectives to maintain the maximum amount of farmers on the land while ensuring a proper standard of living for farmers and fair prices to consumers have not been delivered. The cap funding mechanisms must be changed to help small farmers and rural communities;

A guarantee of a basic income for farmers who stay on their holdings to guarantee their long-term future. This would stop ongoing depopulation and create a positive spin off effect in local rural economies.

A funding initiative to promote organic farming in ireland, co-operative agricultural projects and broadleaf forestry projects should be vigorously promoted and supported;

Funds for rural enterprise projects - sinn fein believes there should be equity in the allocation of funding for local enterprise projects. Funding for indigenous enterprise projects have been cut in recent years.

An increase in leader funds the success of rural development projects under the european union leader programme is well recognised and should play a vital part of any rural regeneration programme. It should be a substantial part of european union funding to rural areas.

A national conference - the dublin government should be prevailed upon to hold an all ireland conference that could formulate a strategy to promote rural development in ireland. Such a conference would have to be organised on a community participatory basis and not be solely representative of the vested interests that dominate agri-business and rural policies today.

Environment

Sinn féin is committed to the principles of sustainable development. The aim of environmental policy both within ireland and the european union must be to create less pollution, use energy wisely and to reduce, reuse and recycle waste.

Sinn féin are calling for:

All-ireland approach to environmental issues

The closure of sellafield

A ban on the production and sale of genetically modified foods

Enactment of european union waste legislation

A ban on the use of incinerators

Equality

Parallel to the moves towards economic and political union by european union member states is the programme to create a social europe. While some progress has been made efforts to tackle social exclusion have yet to be given sufficient priority.

Sinn féin believe that equality and bringing an end to exclusion and discrimination must be at the heart of european union social policy. Sinn féin is calling for:

An eu wide campaign to oppose racism

Legislation to ensure the provision of state childcare facilities

The implementation of an european union wide minimum hourly wage

The extension of social charter to ensure that workers rights are fully protected

Investment in education, housing, health and social services

"Local 1999: Fine Gael (Dublin)","Foreword 

Dublin is well on the way to becoming a world class capital city. It is one of the most popular cities to visit in Europe. It is home to many multinational companies and the globally important International Financial Services Centre. Many of Ireland's great economic success stories are based in the city and its surroundings.

As a centre for culture, music and the arts, the city has reached a level of vibrancy that was unimaginable even ten years ago. Dublin is the home and host of a growing number of major professional and amateur sporting organisations and events.

Yet despite all this success the city is clearly failing to cope. Why? Fine Gael believes that a failure of vision and an acceptance of second best has left the city's citizens trapped by ever worsening public services. Chaotic queuing has replaced proper planning.

In this manifesto Fine Gael sets out its plans for restoring the city to its citizens and allowing communities to take back control of their lives. Proper planning of transport, housing and services is the first step. We have people of the ability and drive to make Dublin a world class capital. This document sets out the way in which harnessing that ability can make Dublin's infrastructure and services as outstanding as its citizens.

As Lord Mayor of Dublin I have witnessed at first hand Dublin’s greatest asset - its people.

Dublin has the youngest population of all the European Capitals and a cultural vibrancy matched by few cities anywhere. It is one of the leading centres for today’s new technologies. Now as we approach the New Millennium we are witnessing a new patriotism which encompasses diversity and respects difference.

All of these factors mean that Dublin has the potential to become one of the great global multicultural cities of the future. But in order to realise this potential, we must tackle some pressing problems.

One of the most recent problems to come to public attention is racism. It is my dearest wish that Dublin should be a welcoming city. For this to happen, all of us living in Dublin need to examine our attitude towards newcomers, recognise diversity and promote awareness and openness. Neither can the housing and traffic crises be allowed to hold the city back. Until the citizens of Dublin have access to affordable housing, we cannot fully enjoy the city’s economic prosperity and social stability. Effective co-ordinated action must be taken to tackle the city’s serious traffic congestion. A congested city is an inefficient city - Dublin cannot be allowed to become such a city.

But I believe this will not happen if we allow Dubliners to use their own initiative and creativity in meeting the challenges that now face us. This manifesto is Fine Gael’s plan to give Dubliners the power they need to shape the future of their own city. And I am confident that with power returned to its citizens and communities, Dublin will fulfil its great potential.

Introduction

Public Squalor Amidst Private Opulence

Successful cities are built on viable communities living within easy access of their needs. While Dublin has seen a transformation in the past decade it now risks being choked by the anarchic development that has accompanied its undoubted success. For many, the apparent opulence is an illusion as they try to cope in the face of many unmet needs for basic services.
• young families can no longer afford to raise their children in the community where they were born and reared, rather they are driven out on to the city’s margins where basic services are poorly provided.
• at a time when both partners are able and often have to work, no proper child care system has been developed.
• while education has allowed many of our people to staff some of the most advanced enterprises in the world, side by side are communities where one-third of the children leave school with insufficient literacy skills to read the back of an aspirin package and many are at risk of drifting into substance abuse or crime.
• at times of sickness, public patients face interminable waiting for diagnosis, for treatment, and for nursing home care.

In too many areas of our life, the potential of technology seems to be dictating to us rather than serving our needs:
• although armed with amazing medical technology that can enhance care, we see beds closed, its use prevented and people deprived of any care at all as they suffer inexcusable waiting and are refused even the basic comforts of home help
• car sales are at record levels but never has it been so hard to make your journey – more transport is delivering less travel;
• we risk passing on a degraded environment as we build mountains of waste and litter;
• the potential of information technology to make public service more accessible to the community is only available to a small few.

These failings are not inevitable. They stem from a failure of vision and an acceptance of second best, which leave the ordinary Dubliner trapped. Chaotic queuing has replaced proper planning in crucial areas of public life – from the taxi rank to the casualty trolley, from the creche to the drug clinic. We are repeating the worst errors of failed models of urban development elsewhere – public squalor amidst private opulence.

Fine Gael’s New Deal for Dublin will allow communities take back control over their lives. Sound principles will underpin public policy. Public service providers will be challenged regarding the standards they offer. Poor planning and abuse of their privileges by monopoly providers will not be accepted.

Dublin – A Region of Sustainable Villages 

Community solidarity can only be built in neighbourhoods. Some developments in Dublin have destroyed neighbourhoods. Others have overlooked the investment needed to build viable communities in suburban dormitory landscapes. Dublin will only thrive if it has neighbourhoods and villages that offer a good quality of life to their communities. Fine Gael aims to rebuild the city and county’s neighbourhoods into sustainable urban villages.

There are a number of elements that are necessary to build successful neighbourhoods:

1. Sustainable communities must have local access to a wider range of services so that for most ordinary needs they are self-sufficient. People should not need to travel outside their neighbourhood, except for specialist services. This means:
• developing new services in community health centres and developing the concept of step down or cottage hospitals
• developing a wide range of shopping, cinemas, restaurants, theatres and clubs available locally
• developing education and employment opportunities that are accessible locally

These require physical location policies that promote a healthy and balanced mix of activities as well as focused policies that harness the potential for remote access through information technology.

2. New Settlement policies that provide affordable homes with high occupancy and high density close to the centre of the urban village and that make the village centre the focal point of development and renewal. This requires:
• getting away from rigid zoning strategies and instead allowing residential infill in industrial zones and supporting employment opportunities close to residential areas
• much stronger incentives for the refurbishment and conversion unoccupied space into usable residential homes, for example, over shops or on derelict open spaces no longer offering community amenity
• developing a blueprint for shopfronts, street furniture and vehicle movement that will make urban villages into living spaces 

3. Community Utilisation policies so that available public resources are fully utilised to meet community needs in flexible ways and at reasonable cost. This means:
• auditing available public resources in schools, clubs and other properties belonging to public agencies
• removing the barriers which often artificially block multiple use of space and equipment (for example in schools, which are often only open seven hours a day for seven months of the year, but have resources which could be invaluable for many community activities.

4. Developing an area focus for tackling public policy issues. This means specific area based strategies for such things as:
• community policing
• tackling drug addiction and its treatment
• enforcing litter control, dereliction, parking
• amenity, sport and leisure activities
• support services for children and families
• tackling educational disadvantage
• community health

To make this happen the statutory agencies have to be prepared to work with the community and with each other to deliver integrated services and to be accountable to their community for their policies. This requires a significant shift in policy and culture for many of these agencies.

5. New concepts in public transport that will facilitate movement within neighbourhoods to complement the present exclusive focus on transport out of neighbourhoods.

Implementation

Many practical steps will have to be taken in order make this vision a reality. Some of the steps that Fine Gael has mapped out are:
• an audit of community resources
• the appointment of a community facilitator for each area answerable to a representative steering committee from the community;
• mandating the Health Board, Garda, F s, Transport Providers and other public agencies to support area based strategies
• mandating these agencies, where appropriate, to undertake joint initiatives in the community which integrate a range of services to support families under pressure. The success of such integrated service initiatives will depend on agencies being willing to devolve the necessary powers and budgets to teams working ""at the coalface"" in the community
• new public policies to deal with issues such as co-operative insurance and security which often hamper more open community access
• mandating planners to develop the necessary local area development plans to give expression to the concept
• building a local business partnership to bring local business fully into the process

Funding

An important part of this new approach will be the devolution of budgets by public agencies in respect of community services to specific community areas giving considerable local discretion regarding their use. Already private contributions to certain community activities attract some tax relief. These include designated urban renewal contributions to disadvantaged schools, employment of Home Help for Incapacitated persons, contributions to nursing homes, contribution to natural science education, employers’ expenditure on childcare. Fine Gael proposes to facilitate the establishment of Local Community Development Funds by broadening the areas where tax relief for both individuals and companies could be obtained in the context of a Community Action Programme by a Local Development Company formed for the purpose. Development levies and revenues generated from operators of new services on franchise from public authorities will also be channelled into such a Fund.

Fine Gael supports continued funding of local partnership initiatives and believes these funds should be protected in the course of re-negotiations of EU funding. Local Authorities will be given a more central role in sustaining this work. Block grants will be available for allocation by the Local Authorities on the basis of competitive application for innovative projects. This funding mechanism will be developed to encourage the raising of matching funding particularly in more prosperous communities.

Strengthening Partnership 

Official Ireland has failed to recognise the very significant breakthroughs that have been made in embracing community involvement and innovative responses to social problems in many new pilot initiatives. These can be seen in the Partnership Companies, in the Local Drug Task Forces, in Neighbourhood Watch and in Community Education Projects, to mention just a few. It is now time to harness what has been learned from these initiatives and to provide a sound basis for planning their future as part of a mainstream policy response.

A new framework is needed to allow the continuing development of such initiatives in a coherent way, while retaining their capacity for flexibility and innovation. In many areas there are opportunities for deepening the involvement of the community sector, notably in health and in education. New responsibilities will also require stronger accountability both to the D il and to the local community by the revelent groups.

There is a genuine concern that the integration into local government of such initiatives might smother rather than develop the community partnership approach. These concerns will be respected. Fine Gael believes that the urban village can become the focal point of area based strategies with strong community involvement. A new framework will involve:
• the designation of spheres of policy for community action indicating broad criteria within which they would work and the types of budgets that might be devolved
• the undertaking of a local area based audit of population need and available services in order to identify potential projects through a process of wide consultation
• contract arrangements with a mix of providers to achieve targeted outcomes with agreed costs
• regular democratic scrutiny through the committees of local councillors of the community based initiatives, and transparent rules for the election or appointment of members of Partnership Companies

It is clear that there are a growing number of major social needs in our neighbourhoods that will not be successfully served by the market alone. The concept of developing a social economy in our neighbourhoods is vital if we are to secure a balanced development of our urban villages. Already we are seeing the stresses emerge in the inadequate provision of care for the elderly and care for the young. These are the gaps that are beginning to be filled through community partnerships, but much more can be done.

Operation Permanent Freeflow 

Fine Gael, while in government, introduced the first serious strategy to tackle Dublin’s mounting traffic chaos through Operation Freeflow. Fine Gael has sustained this by detailed planning of effective policies for Dublin Traffic. Fine Gael has the will to make this strategy work.

There are few areas where the present government’s dithering has been more costly than in the area of public transport. There was a long delay while a new consultancy on Luas was commissioned, only to have all its key recommendations rejected. Both time and money were lost that should have been applied to tackle the city’s poor transport infrastructure. The failure to invest in new buses and new trains has damaged the reputation of public transport at a time when everyone knows that it must become more attractive and more available. This has allowed the concept of Quality Bus Corridors to become discredited in the eyes of many Dublin commuters. Fine Gael is determined that a clear long-term strategy and immediate decisive action must quickly be put in place to make up the lost ground.

Long Term Strategy 

There is no coherence in the present delivery of transport policy in Dublin. There are many elements that must make up a new long-term transport strategy for Dublin. The central aims of policy in the long-term must be
• to facilitate a reduction in unnecessary requirements on people to travel
• to optimise the mode of travel to efficiently meet the different needs of the public
• to utilise developing infrastructures and roadspace in order to imaginatively meet needs
• to deliver quality transport services whose providers are responsive to changing needs and properly accountable to the public

It cannot be a one-dimensional policy where engineers impose designs that the public must live with. Public transport will be the main mode for growth. However, the strategy must recognise that further rapid growth of car ownership in Dublin is inevitable. This must be managed. Options that permit higher utilisation of available road space must be part of a balanced policy. Options such as under passes or overpasses for road vehicles and lanes that double as inbound in the morning and outbound in the afternoon, must be part of the mix. Key elements of our long-term strategy are:
• Switching the focus from urban sprawl to developing sustainable neighbourhoods that reduce the need to travel
• Quality alternatives to the car will be offered. There will be bigger fleets of buses and trains and new routes including orbital routes responding to changing travel needs
• Transport service contracts with built-in quality standards of service will be put out to competitive tender from either public or private providers
• The painfully slow implementation of quality bus corridors and cycle lanes will be accelerated
• Progressive removal of heavy goods vehicles from residential areas will be planned. Initially they will continue to be allowed on dedicated routes for deliveries at specified off peak times. However, when major transport infrastructures are in place, a complete HGV ban within the M50 boundary should be possible
• All employers with more than 50 employees will be required to develop Commuter Plans for their staff (flexi-time, public transport vouchers, facilitating options to work from home promoting carpools and company minibuses)

Immediate Action 

While these are long-term strategies that will take time to implement, there are many initiatives that will be implemented within a tight time limit of no more than one year. These include:
• the development of integrated ticketing on public transport, so that one ticket will bring you to your destination regardless of how many changes are made
• local secure park and ride facilities for both cars and bicycles
• safe routes to local schools marked out to allow children to walk to school in safety and encouragement to schools to develop the concept of a supervised ""walking bus"" (including a facility to carry bags)
• the introduction of off peak refuse collection and deliveries in all the key centres
• the charging of an excavation rental to any public utility roads, with a premium paid for peak hour openings and a continuing rental charged until satisfactory restoration is completed
• permission for hackney drivers to use bus lanes
• progressive liberalisation of taxis with annual demand-led issues of new licences (to follow the present 800 planned new licences) and the permitting of taxi sharing
• an immediate programme of surface repair and improvement on all roads used by cyclists (outside of the dedicated lane) to make this a safer option
• certain parking will be reserved for car pools

A Home of Your Own 

The housing crisis in Dublin has not been addressed. House prices now exceed those of the leading capitals in Europe. A person on average wages who borrows up to their maximum limit will still be  50,000 short in bidding for an average house in Dublin. Government intervention has perversely accelerated the rise in rents which are often prohibitively high, difficult to get (especially where there are children) and offer no security of tenure. Ordinary workers who have been the backbone of this country’s economic success are now being priced out of a share in the benefits that they have won.

A coherent housing policy is needed rather than ad hoc interventions that often have perverse side effects. Policy must address several objectives:
• reduce the cost of entry for first-time buyers to the housing market
• increase the supply of housing through new cities, greenfield development and infill development, particularly around our urban villages;
• develop new models of public housing which give communities the stability of home ownership but require re-sale back to the public authority;
• promote a competitive private rented sector with guaranteed quality standards;
• facilitate the possibility of moving home during a family’s life cycle so that families occupy property of a size suitable to their needs;
• allow older people get access to some of the value of their assets tied up in the family home to support their needs.

This requires a much more flexible housing market than we have had in the past where people have become ""locked in"" to housing due to the high costs involved. This has resulted in high social costs for Dublin as older areas with good facilities suffer falling population and new areas with few facilities undergo population explosions. The aim must be to have a housing market that meets demand more efficiently and public polices that give a fairer deal, particularly to first-time buyers.

In order to tackle the crisis in housing supply, Fine Gael will:
• set a target of 17,500 social housing units for Dublin over the next 5 years
• introduce a new model of public housing where homes are allocated on the basis of need, occupiers accumulate ownership in recoupable shares, and sales can only be back to a holding company. The advantage of this model is clear. It gives communities the stability of home ownership. It allows people who need to move access to a substantial block of cash related to their years of occupancy. It prevents publicly funded houses being siphoned off to the private market.
• introduce a two-month time limit for Bord Plean la consideration of planning appeals. In the transition to this, developments of 50 houses and over will be first to operate under this limit
• carry out a trawl of land in public ownership to release sites for starter homes
• introduce new planning regulations where minimum-planning formality will be required where developers comply with broad principles set out for certified zones.
• develop transitional housing options for homeless people
• develop new centres of population outside of Dublin which would be built consciously around the concept of sustainable communities

To promote more efficient housing, Fine Gael will:
• undertake a full review of all elements in the transaction cost of housing sales including stamp duties to identify ways of reducing or spreading the cost of changing home
• introduce schemes to permit senior citizens to sell their home to a local authority in return for a senior citizens flat or for a life interest as tenant in the house, with the property reverting to the local authority after death
• provide tax relief for landlords who let their property on long leases
• enact the Fine Gael Anti Gazumping Bill immediately
• change planning law to impose clear legal responsibility on builders to complete housing development to a proper standard
• establish a network of independent housing information and advice centres to meet the rapidly rising demand for information about housing options in the present very difficult housing market.

While measures to improve the housing market will undoubtedly ease price pressures over time, there is an immediate need to address the fairness of access to the available supply particularly for families who are first time buyers trying to get on to the bottom rung of home ownership. To promote fairness, Fine Gael will:
• increase the first time buyers grant from  3,000 to  5,000
• amend the Shared Ownership Scheme to make it more accessible to applicants by increasing the ""income multiple"" applied to the mortgage element and improving the rental subvention for low income applicants
• exempt first time buyers from paying stamp duty on second hand houses
• make rent and mortgage interest supplement available on equal terms to persons in low paid work as to those who are unemployed, based on actual disposable income
• introduce a quota that will allow 15% of all new residential developments to be channeled to shared ownership purchasers or tenant purchasers surrendering a local authority home
• allow local authority tenants to buy shares in flats on the basis of this new partnership model
• establish an effective unit for enforcing accommodation standards in rented accommodation, targeting in particular accommodation where the Health Board provides a subvention
• support the expansion of co-ownership models in the private sector

Patients First 

Our health service is in crisis. This is nowhere more evident than in Dublin. Our flagship hospitals and national centres of excellence in Dublin find themselves cash-starved and constrained, having to close beds and cancel elective admissions in order to keep within budget.

The growth in our population - increases in births, the return of emigrants and greater longevity have placed our health services under unprecedented pressure. Neither the Minister for Health nor his Department has yet come to terms with the needs of the growing population in the Greater Dublin area.

Waiting lists in Dublin are up 20% since the present Minister took office. There are now 17,584 people waiting in Dublin, almost half of the entire national list.

Many of those on the waiting lists have to wait for between 12 months to 2 years for the treatment to which they are entitled. Some have to wait even longer.

There are in effect two waiting lists for public patients. The 17,584 people on the Dublin waiting lists have seen a consultant and have been assessed as requiring a hospital bed. There are many thousands of adults and children in Dublin on another waiting list - those awaiting initial appointments with a consultant. The Department of Health does not keep statistics of those people awaiting consultations. This is the hidden waiting list - the queue to join a queue. This hidden waiting list is often very long. Examples are 5 months for an initial appointment with a consultant dermatologist, 8 months for an ophthalmologist and 6 months for a gynaecologist.

Fine Gael is committed to equality of access to health care for all of those who require essential treatment, and to a new and expanded Patients Charter.

Fine Gael also commits itself to improving the existing service for children, the elderly and the disabled.

To deliver this new Charter of Care, Fine Gael will introduce:

To Wipe out waiting lists:
• Specific timeframes for a patient to attend with a consultant for an opinion and to obtain treatments or surgery.
• Joint waiting lists for consultants who specialise in a particular branch of medicine and practice in a particular hospital or health board area in order to spread the work evenly.
• An on-line, interactive service between GPs and hospitals to facilitate GPs obtaining information on consultant waiting lists and waiting times. This would enable GPs to help their patients to have the earliest possible access to consultant care.
• Additional ""step down"" facilities for people, particularly the elderly, who require nursing care, but not acute hospital care. This would free up many beds.
• Expansion of dedicated day surgery units, and the end of bed closures for budget balancing.
• Additional resources to GPs to carry out testing which does not require consultant involvement. Such a change in medical practice would help with earlier diagnosis and may reduce the pressure on the secondary - hospital - services.
• Equality of access to medical technology

Fine Gael is committed to ensuring that the most up-to-date medical technology is available for proper patient care. We are also committed to ensuring that public patients are not discriminated against and we will provide the resources to ensure that they have equal access to such technology.

Dublin Disability Access 2000

Fine Gael aims to make Dublin the access capital of Europe, a model city that allows people with a disability to participate fully in the life of the city. This will be a major Millennium project.

A Community Action Plan to achieve access will be developed. A steering committee with majority representation of persons with a disability will be put in place to undertake an audit of the barriers to access in Dublin and to consult on the policy actions necessary.
• An Access Officer in each local authority will be appointed.
• Every service provider will be required to publish an Annual Action Plan giving a statement of the improvements it has made in the year and its plans for the future
• Codes of practice will be developed for different facilities. A Quality Mark will be awarded where good standards are achieved, and a lemon awarded to those making no real effort.
• Every planning application for public facilities will be audited to ensure adequate provision for access and proper anticipation of the sort of wiring and other connections necessary to facilitate the use of modern technology in the home and at work by persons with a disability.
• The existing building regulations will be reviewed to identify areas for improvements.
• Immediate priorities will be the dishing of footpaths and the provision of ramps to public buildings.

In each village centre, a comprehensive audit of the access status of facilities will be undertaken. A public private partnership approach will be developed with local business and community interest to identify measures to be taken.

Fine Gael is committed to providing the resources necessary for the early implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in regard to the need for additional residential and respite care places, additional money for aids and appliances and for the provision of personal assistance services.

The New Deal for Citizens 

There is a widespread sense of powerlessness among Dublin citizens. Although Dublin is the capital city and is the national headquarters for many services, it is very difficult for the ordinary Dubliner

to have his or her voice heard. There are far more accessible channels of influence on services outside of the city. The fragmentation of local authorities and the national (rather than regional) mandates of institutions operating in Dublin deprive citizens of influence over the crucial services that impact on their daily lives. This is evident in hospital, transport, police, education and recreation services. To counteract this, Fine Gael offers a New Deal for Dublin’s citizens. It has three pillars. The first pillar is a Citizen’s Charter:
• standards of service will be published by all service providers in Dublin
• this will include health, policing, taxis, buses, ports and Dart and also standards of grass cutting, gully maintenance, litter removal and restoration after excavation etc. In addition, each body will be asked to set out response times, punctuality limits, rights of consultation, and terms of access including special provisions for persons with special needs
• each agency will be required to publish indicators twice yearly setting out the standards that have been achieved in each area
• each agency will be required to have a published complaint procedure

A joint committee comprising local authority members from each of the four Dublin local authorities will be appointed to monitor the standards set and their achievement, and compare achievement to best practice overseas. In time, agencies will be expected to commit themselves to compensate customers who experience significant lapses from the standards that they have set. Where a provider consistently fails to provide adequate standards, this would trigger the opening of a tender for another service provider to replace that provider.

A second pillar of the New Deal for citizens in Dublin will be to make administration in government more accountable to Dubliners. Certain decisions now exercised exclusively by the Local Authority Manager will become democratic decisions to be taken by the Council. This will include the decisions on key planning applications.

Fine Gael will facilitate the holding of a Referendum by the citizens to decide how Dublin should be governed. Clear choices will be outlined:
• the establishment of a Greater Dublin Authority to which certain county-wide functions would be given
• the election of a ""Mayor"" from among the members of each Council, and who would be have certain executive powers
• the direct election by the people of a Mayor with executive powers

Fine Gael will seek the adoption of key policy changes for Dublin:
• the vigorous pursuit of the urban village concept
• integrated ticketing on public transport services
• competition for public service contracts on bus routes
• the introduction of the citizens charter

If these are not adopted, Fine Gael will organise citywide petitions to secure a public mandate for these essential changes.

The third pillar in the new deal for citizens will be the establishment of a Standards Board in each local authority to oversee the declaration of interest by members and officials, and a code of conduct in respect of the activities of members and officials. If necessary, people will be disqualified from office if they fail to respect these standards.

A Clean City 

Fine Gael is committed to a waste strategy that will significantly increase recycling and reduce the dependency on crude landfill policies. The policy will:
• offer separation and collection of recyclable waste to 80% of Dublin households
• increase household recycling from 3% to 60% of the waste stream in the medium to longterm
• recover at least half of all packaging
• establish a biological treatment plant for organic waste
• set stringent standards for the operation of incineration

Substantial investment will be needed to achieve a sound waste policy based on the principles of Avoid, Minimise, Recycle and Reuse. This can be partially funded by charges made on polluters. Industry too will have to carry some of the cost. Construction and industrial/commercial waste account for 83% of Dublin’s Waste Stream.

Fine Gael will aim to achieve ""Blue Flag"" status for a significant number of Dublin’s beaches by 2002, when the new sewage recycling facilities in Ringsend and all around the County of Dublin will be fully on stream. Family friendly beaches will be introduced with designated permitted recreational uses in different areas.

Dublin’s litter standards remain lamentable for a capital which attracts so many tourists. A vigorous campaign of enforcement with additional mobile litter wardens will be put in place. Commercial property owners will be vigorously pursued in respect of their obligations under the 1996 Litter Act. Legislation in respect of dogs fouling public places will be vigorously enforced. The number of litter bins will be significantly increased. The Litter Removal service will commit the resources necessary to achieve the following standards of removal of significant accumulations of litter:
• within three hours at Dart Stations and in neighbourhood centres;
• within six hours from high density housing areas;
• within twelve hours from low density housing areas, public parks, rivers and canals.

Litter squads will be developed to facilitate this rapid response, particularly at weekends. If the public service cannot commit to delivering these standards, the market will be tested for private delivery of some or all of the service.

Children First 

Despite our apparent wealth, Dublin is becoming a difficult place in which to raise children. Every family is experiencing increasing pressures. Where both partners have to work, it is often impossible to get quality childcare at an affordable price; frequently over  100 per child per week. Most workers get no relief with these costs, while those lucky enough to work with more progressive employers can avail of childcare subsidised by the taxpayer.

Many families battle against the odds as they try to educate children in the face of the social and economic disadvantage that our education system has reinforced rather than alleviated.

Nostalgia for an idealised picture of the past must not prevent the emergence of adequate policies for new realities.

There is now hard evidence of the failures of public policy:
• In some parts of our city 30% of young people leave the education system without adequate levels of literacy
• Each year over 5,000 young people in Dublin are referred to the Garda  for involvement in juvenile offences. A quarter of them is under the age of 13.
• More than one in ten young people have become involved in juvenile offences before reaching the age of 18

It is time to have a coherent policy of putting ""Children First"". This is one key area where there must be an area-based focus requiring different agencies to co-operate in order to develop integrated responses to local needs.

Some elements in this strategy include:
• Local primary schools will be made available for the franchised provision of child care both after school hours, and in any unused rooms
• Subsidised quality pre-school will be developed for all children likely to face educational disadvantage
• New Planning Guidelines will be introduced to facilitate the provision of child care in residential areas in accord with transparent criteria
• District Care Teams to integrate services for children at risk
• A Local Education Mediation Service will be developed to track all children from age 14 years onwards who are at risk of early school leaving. This service will involve counselling, mentoring, appropriate placement and aftercare.

Fine Gael is committed to a radical restructuring of the child welfare, protection and adoption services that apply in the Dublin area. Presently the Eastern Health Board is unable to cope with the demands placed on it to speedily investigate reports of child abuse; to provide specialised residential care or foster care for children who require it, or to undertake and complete adoption assessment within a reasonable timeframe.

National Policy will also have to change to make a Children First Policy possible. Some of the changes necessary are:
• The rate of child benefit will be increased by 12 per week for children under the age of 5
• A scheme of income support will be introduced for low income families where children over the age of 15 enter an agreement to attend diligently in education and refrain from work that would interfere with this study
• A scheme of employee leave options either unpaid or in lieu of overtime payments will be developed to allow workers have leave for the care of sick children or on other required occasions
• The Juvenile Diversion Programmes will be substantially developed with innovative use of community service and methods for reintegrating young people into the education and training systems.

"Local 1999: Green Party","Introduction:

Politics With A Value System

The Green Party/Comhaontas Glas has developed a deserved reputation for being the political party (1029 with the most concern for the environment. While being successful in highlighting and forcing the political bytes) system to respond to environmental issues, being seen as the e nvironmental party has also become something of a straitjacket that has restricted Greens from highlighting our wider policy agenda. These local elections offer an ideal opportunity to inform the electorate as to how wide the Green agenda is.

Irish politics is filled with political parties who differ not at all from each other. Only the Green Party can truly claim to be distinct. Local authorities are badly in need of a fresh approach. Only the Green Party is offering the electorate that choice.

Four policy pillars inform Green Party thinking.
Social Justice
Grassroots Democracy
Equality 
The Environment

From these pillars all other policies follow. These are the values that the Green Party will seek to put in place in local councils, and they will inform the policy positions we will be highlighting within this manifesto, and later hopefully in the council chambers throughout the country.

Social Justice
Despite a booming economy we live in a grossly unequal society, where success is still too dependent on where you live, how well connected or situated you or your family is, your opportunity to be educated, and even the ability to move from place to place.

Grassroots Democracy
The Green Party/Comhaontas Glas believes that the way decisions are made is often as important, if not (1029 more so, than actual decisions made. The overriding principle should be that any person who is affected bytes) by the making of a decision should be involved in the making of such decisions. We rigorously oppose any attempt to take power further away from people, and in seeking election to political structures we attempt to redistribute power, so that all decisions are made at the most local level possible.

Bringing about a better democracy means assisting people in becoming better informed, engaging in wider consultation, and ensuring that properly agreed decisions are quickly and effectively implemented. It means changing from a 'winner takes all' system of politics to a system where everyone is a winner.

Equality
The world of politics is too oriented by grey middle aged, able bodied men. It is a world where point (1029 scoring is thought more important than issues, where he who shouts loudest is thought more of than he bytes) who argues best. How meetings are organised and where they are held, favour men over women highlighting issues that are important to men, while ignoring issues vital to women. There are too few women in politics. Not only should there be more women in politics, but our system also needs to be changed by feminist values. Equally, minority interests are not only having their views heard, they are not being allowed to be seen to represent themselves.

The Environment
Environmental issues will always remain high on the Green agenda, but we believe that we have (1029 environmental problems because of how decisions are made, and how we structure society and the bytes) economy. Our priority will be to maintain and protect and enhance our environment - improving the very quality of life.

Through a significant Green Party presence on local councils, we intend to challenge the style and the culture of how local government operates. Among our objectives will be: Changing the timing and structure of council meetings to maximise public participation. Arranging for the holding of meetings in local community venues.

Restructuring the decision making process so that consultation is engaged at the beginning and not towards the end of any process.

Ensuring that Strategic Policy Committees are made to have an active part in the decision making process of local councils, and that the nominated members from outside bodies of these committees can be made feel fully involved.

Increasing the ability of local councils to bring about legislation through the passing of byelaws.

Refusing to participate in exclusive pacts designed to create j obs for the boys, working to see that appointed positions within the councils are done fairly and on merit.

Improving reporting procedures from outside agencies (Health Board, Vocational Education Committee), with the holding of debates and the producing of regular reports. Actively opposing attempts by any public representative who operates a Dual Mandate to be appointed to any outside body or agency. The Green Party/Comhaontas Glas actively opposes and does not operate the Dáil/ local authority dual mandate.

Developing a code of practice whereby knowledge and information gained through attendance at conferences and seminars can be made more widely available.

Producing proposals that would allow for the regular holding of local referenda and initiatives.

To double spending on Community Development, on a year on year basis, during the lifetime of the next local councils.
To devise ways in which expenditure can be directly allocated and used within local communities, by recognised community groupings
To make use of a Community Forum where potential areas of controversy can be first aired, and methods of eliminating conflict can be agreed.
To have implemented within the City and County Development Plans a minimum standard of community facilities to exist in each identified community.
To campaign to have Community Employment schemes restructured into volunteer support programmes, recognising the valuable work such schemes do in local communities.
To transform twinning arrangements with sister councils onto a more community oriented focus.

Housing
The provision of housing has become this country's most serious social problem. As Housing Authorities, local authorities will be pushed by the Green Party to properly fulfill their obligations in this by

Ensuring that each council operates an open system of housing allocation, so housing applicants can visually see where they stand and how long they have to wait to secure housing.

Developing a Housing policy that concentrates house building on derelict sites rather than green field sites; that limits the number of houses that can be built on any one site; and that rules out the use of multi-storey apartment blocks.

Adopting the widespread use of effective Estate management schemes, allowing for proper maintenance budgets being spent in local communities

Encouraging the development of rural resettlement schemes.

Exempting from stamp duty all houses under the value of £150,000 Re-introducing Certificates of Reasonable Value to curb developers profit margins. Working to ensure that sufficient serviced halting stop spaces, and varied accomodation types are made available to meet the needs of the Travelling Community, in consultation with travellers and travellers groups, eliminating the practice of unofficial road side sites. Encouraging the settling of refugees in a sensitive and proportionate way, that will help make an appropriate response to the difficulties that such people find themselves in, and will add to the cultural make up of our population.

Ensuring that all future housing is fully accessible to people of all abilities.

Developing a plan to identify and acquire institutional land for use in housing development.

Substantially increasing funding for social housing, increasing the unit grant available, and raising the percentage that can be retain by voluntary housing agencies Improving security systems, especially in housing areas where large numbers of tenants are elderly.

Promoting the instant transfer of properties, to stem vandalism, speed up housing transfers, and reduce maintenance costs.

Insisting that housing repairs will be made within the shortest period of time through the introduction of a Tenants Charter.

Encouraging the use of materials in the building and repairing of houses that will lead to near maintenance free housing, using materials that are energy efficient and will help reduce house running costs.

Economic Development and Planning
The Celtic Tiger has become a much abused animal. Undoubtedly there has been an increase in (1029 economic prosperity, but recent job losses show how fragile this economy can be. With new powers for bytes) local government, the Green Party believes that local councils can play a stronger role in developing the economic future of their regions. Fás, the IDA, and the City Enterprise Board should make regular reports and presentations to these councils.

Local authorities should consider making more adventurous use of their rates collection systems to act as an incentive to encourage business as to where its locates and the physical appearance it shows. For example better frontage and signage can be achieved using such methods. The emphasis should be placed on encouraging medium sized Irish based industries to develop and prosper. Overdependence on large multi-national companies could bring us back to a Fords or Dunlops in Cork, Fruit of the Loom in Donegal, or Packard Electric in Tallaght situation.

We believe in the importance of the social economy, and will discourage the use of employment schemes such as Community Employment in providing work that otherwise should be full timeemployment (e.g. janitors, school secretaries etc.). Further we believe in increasing the numbers of places available in such schemes for more effective use in voluntary, community programmes. Local authorities should be playing a major role in developing the tourism potential of their regions.

Our basic planning principles should be that we preserve rather than knock, and that we build in harmony with what is there, rather than accepting buildings for buildings sake.

Information on planning needs to improve, we would favour the adoption of the Scottish system of informing all residents within a set distance of a planning development, by letter.

Retention planning permission should no longer be available, either permission exists beforehand or no building work should take place. We favour the need for planning permission to be sought before the removal of hedgerows over large areas.

We favour the promotion of tree-linked development where every planning permission given for each housing unit should be accompanied by a condition to plant a tree.

We also need to present a system of planning that is as open as we need our system of politics to be. We must work to avoid the appearance of collusion with corrupt interests that have produced the current tribunals of inquiry.

Funding Local Government
The Green Party will continue to oppose service charges. We believe that any money collected should be instead of, and not in addition to national taxation. We favour services being free at the point of use, with any charges being made to discourage the abuse of these services. We support stronger legislation against the making of spurious compensation claims that have been such a huge drain on the finances of local authorities.

The Environment
Air Quality
Having campaigned successfully to have a smoke free zone created in Dublin, in Cork, and in several (1029 other urban centres and having secured the closure of many hospital incinerators throughout the bytes) country, the Green Party will continue to make the improvement of air quality a priority. We will be working for

A comprehensive health survey to measure the extent of respiratory conditions, in particular childhood asthma, and the developing of a tracking system to see whether the numbers suffering from these conditions is lessening or increasing.

Increasing the number of air monitoring stations, measuring for more air pollutants, at half hourly peaks instead of 24 hour averages.

Better monitoring to halt the sale and use of smoky coal, which has been steadily increasing. 

To insist that the treatment of sewage is done to the most advanced level possible, appropriate for the population area being catered for.

To adopt a get tough policy in relation to the far too regular pollution of waterways.

To challenge the continuing addition of fluoride to drinking water supplies.

To ensure that Regional Fisheries Boards be given much stronger powers to deal with marine and freshwater pollution and other threats to fisheries and water quality.

Waste and Litter
EU and Irish laws should be prohibiting, wherever feasible, the manufacture of goods destined solely for disposal. 

Producer Responsibility Obligations (PROs) requiring industrial, agriculture and commercial facilities to prevent and minimise waste production need to be greatly extended and enforced. We consider Repak, established in 1995 by IBEC and the Department of the Environment, to have been an abject failure.

Deposit/refund schemes should be re-institutued for beverage containers.

Separation of waste must become mandatory - Irish recycling levels at 8% are the second lowest in the EU.

Policy needs to be developed to deal with Construction and Demolition waste, vastly growing through the building boom. Much of this waste has a reuse value.

Landfill sites, where they exist, should be of limited size and of fixed tenure, situated as close as possible to where waste is being produced.

We oppose any attempt to use incineration, even when promoted as Waste to Energy, as a means of dealing with the waste problem. We remain opposed because incineration merely transfers the waste problem into another form. Far from decreasing the amount being produced, incineration needs

Introduce a name and shame policy for litter offenders.

Agenda 21
To push local councils into having real consultation with local communities in helping to produce an (1029 environmental plan (Agenda 21). Such a plan should be updated each year through an annual report, containing proactive environmental policies on areas such as protecting and enhancing the built environment; preserving and increasing green space and amenity areas; introducing a tree protection plan; and promoting the use of environmental materials.
To include in local Agenda 21s the need for greater numbers of pollution officers in each local authority.
Every Borough Corporation should develop its own 'urban forestry' strategy.
We will continue to encourage the continued co-ordination of local authorities in their combined opposition to the Sellafield nuclear plant, and nuclear facilities throughout Britain.

Masts and Pylons
We will oppose the construction of any further electricity pylons, and seek to have a programme (1029 implemented that will replace existing pylons, freeing land that can be made available for housing or amenity use.
We will campaign against any increase in mobile phone or communications masts, insisting that existing facilities will be shared. We will be seeking that planning permission for these structures be reviewed on a regular basis.

Animal Rights
Halt the killing of badgers with snares. Lobby for funding for badger vaccine as a means of controlling bovine TB.

Roads and Transport
The Green Party will be encouraging local authorities to change the emphasis of its roads bytes) and transport policies by Allocating money to repair roads before building new roads.
Introducing more restricted traffic systems, barring large vehicles from travelling or parking on many city and town streets.
Prioritising footpath repair before road repairs.
Increasing the pedestrianisation programme to produce largely car free City and Town Centres.
Reducing reliance on City Centre Multi-Storey car parks, and increasing use of out of town park and ride facilities.
Reviewing facilities and regulations as they apply to taxi-cabs, to encourage widest possible use, taking particular care in ensuring that licenses granted for wheelchair accessible taxis are used mainly for this use.
Doubling the length of cycleways available, on a year on year basis, to complete a nationwide cycleways network within the next five years. Identifying and passing bye-laws that will allow cyclists greater advantage in using the roads network.
Introducing far more bus priority routes to cut bus journey times.
Introducing a national school bus programme. This will also help eliminate morning and

Health and Childcare
The Green Party will be seeking that local councils have greater involvement with Health services and (1029 Health issues. To be more responsive to the needs of the people this is very necessary, especially in bytes) relation to health services and women. Issues such as domestic violence towards women demands a more proactive response from local councils in highlighting the existence of the problem, and in providing material support. On the issue of child care, local authorities have a responsibility to provide child care facilities at its administrative and recreational centres.

The record of investment in childcare in Ireland is very low by European standards. Within the EU Ireland has the lowest employment rate of mothers with children under 10 years of age. Irish parents spend two and half times more on child care than elsewhere in Europe.

Managing the social crisis caused through the abuse and misuse of drugs needs radically different approaches. We decry the continuing failure to provide professional, properly resourced treatment centres for young people suffering from drug abuse, and we are especially worried that children under the age of fifteen are totally uncatered for in this regard.

There needs to be greater liaison in identifying and dealing with risks that come about through poor environmental conditions, for example air quality. In nominating members to sit on the various Health Boards, local authorities need to insist that such policies come into being.

The purchasing policies of local authorities and health boards should also be examined to ensure that best health policies can be promoted, for example by refusing to purchase any genetically modified food.

Disability
The Green Party/Comhaontas Glas undertakes to ensure that all public buildings become wheelchair
Any person appointed to a public body to represent disability interests must only be done so after appropriate consultation with the relevant disability groups.

Agriculture, The Marine and Rural Development
To oppose the closure of any further essential services in rural communities based on population criteria, (1029 and on developing new criteria based on distance from such services. 
Encourage the development of open markets in all towns, particularly for the sale of local produce.
Use purchasing power of local authorities to assist organic, small scale, less intensive farming.
To draw up and implement local plans for integrated coastal zone management Each Council or Region to designate marine nature reserves and seek support from national and EU authorities
Local action plans for small fishing ports, processing plants, hatcheries and restocking projects of suitable species in new sanctuary areas.

Education and the Youth Service
Through their involvement with the Vocational Education Committees, local authorities similarly need to (1029 promote better educational policies. The problem of adult literacy needs greater resources and a more proactive approach from state agencies. The developing Youth Service needs recognition from local councils in maximising use of all current public facilities and in ensuring that facilities are provided where none exist.

Emergency Services
The Green Party will work to ensure that emergency services  the Fire Brigade and the Civil Defence are given the maximum amount of resources necessary to be kept in a state of constant readiness in the

Recreation and Amenity
The Green Party will work to enhance and improve upon Local Authority recreational facilities by: 
Restructuring the admission charges for recreational facilities, so that senior citizens, young people and the unemployed can access these facilities at minimal or no cost, helping to maximise participation.
Bringing about a large increase in the number of playground facilities, by developing the concept of No Insurance Zones.
Fully utilising waterfronts to construct riverside walks.

Arts and Culture
We need greater investment in the Arts. Not enough use is made of the responsibilities of local (1029 authorities under the Arts Act to make such expenditure. Green Party/Comhaontas Glas representatives will encourage local authorities to take their responsibilities towards the Arts by:

Placing a greater community emphasis on arts activities
Continuing to increase resources to libraries putting particular emphasis on information technology.

"Local 1999: Sinn Fein","SINN FÉIN PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST

A Chara,

For many years now the establishment parties have shown a complete disregard for local government in this state. This was most clearly demonstrated by the reticence of successive governments to call these elections.

Sinn Féin is a republican party, which in its simplest terms means government of the people by the people. By any definition of the term, the lack of power afforded to local government authorities throughout the 26 Counties is a denial of that right. The entire structure of local government is crying out for reform.

Sinn Féin advocates a decentralised system affording a direct role to local people and community and special interest groups. For local authorities to have more power, they must have the power to control their own finances. Unlike all of the other parties we want social justice, we want economic wealth shared across all spectrums of society. We believe in building democracy from ground up.

My pledge to voters in this local government election is that by electing a Sinn Féin councillor you are making a positive difference. A vote for Sinn Féin is a vote for people power over centralised bureaucracy. A vote for Sinn Féin is a vote for a radical alternative to the cronyism and corruption that characterises the current structures.

Advancing Local Democracy

Sinn Féin is calling for a root and branch reform of the current system so that we can see the people of Ireland in control of local government.

Sinn Féin will end:

Corruption in local government. We support stringent codes of conduct and ethics for councillors.

The process of concentrating power and resources in central gov ernment. The rights of local government must be enshrined in the Constitution.

Top-down decision-making. Critical decisions about planning and policy must come from the ground up. We want real people power.

Inadequate waste management policies. Sinn Féin will give local government the power to introduce proper waste-management strategies. We must reduce, reuse, recycle.

Inadequate planning procedures currently dominated by vested interests and profiteers. Sinn Féin will create democratic peopleled planning that caters for all the needs of local communities.

Sinn Féin wants to give councils the power and resources to:

Tackle the housing crisis at a local level by building homes, setting laws on rent control, halting profiteering by property developers.

Develop and run local enterprises that create jobs or provide vital social services to communities.

Put local government in control of health, education and social services. Communities are best placed to decide what they need

Abolish unelected quangos. There are more people appointed to these bodies in the 26 Counties than there are elected representa tives. Sinn Féin will bring democracy to these bodies.

Give people power over the purse strings. Local government in Ireland controls only 10 percent of public spending. Other European Union states average 30 to 40 percent.

Shaping the Future

Since the last local government elections we have seen many developments on the road to a lasting peace settlement, in all of which Sinn Féin have been central. We saw the evolving of the Irish peace process, two IRA cessations, negotiations in 1998 leading to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. An Agreement which was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the people of Ireland.

Sinn Féin committed ourselves to the full implementation of the Agreement and have participated in the process in good faith. We have honoured all of our commitments. However, the last year has been one of missed opportunities and broken promises. We have seen an absence of political progress, the ongoing siege of the residents of the Garvaghy Road by the Orange Order and hundreds of attacks on the nationalist community by loyalist death squads.

The failure to establish the Executive and the all Ireland Ministerial Council is as a result of the refusal of the British government and the unionists to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.

While much has been achieved in the last five years a lot more hard work is required. The Good Friday Agreement needs to be implemented. Equality and Justice must become a reality. Sinn Féin has shown our willingness to take difficult and hard decisions and to lead from the front. We are committed to the transformation of Irish society and are working to develop agreement among the people of Ireland. We are

confident that we can make this happen Sinn Féin is working for:

The full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement

A lasting peace settlement

Irish unity and independence

Local Government Structures

In the 26 Counties, there has been a continuing erosion of local government structures and power since partition. The situation currently existing in the 26 Counties makes a mockery of local government. Political appointees control agencies like the Health Boards and development bodies. Government agencies with budgets of hundreds of millions of pounds take decisions and implement policies that affect us all hugely. At the same time, elected councillors sit on authorities whose powers and spending power are dwarfed by the power of unelected quangos.

Sinn Féin supports three formal elected tiers for local government in the 26 Counties:

Regional Councils - To play a coordinating role with regard to planning, the environment, and local economic development in consultation with the sub authorities in their area and with the general public. Such councils are a vital part of local government because they would take on many of the roles played by central government in formulating and applying economic and social policies.

County Councils - To have their existing powers widened. They should be able to play a major role in economic activities both in terms of rural and industrial development. County Councils could play a role in job creation by assessing and responding to local communities' needs for social and other amenities. Both County and District councils should be responsible for the provision of education, health and social services, as well as housing, roads, water supply, and sewerage.

District Councils - To integrate towns and their natural hinterlands into one local government. It would take into account the reality of increased urbanisation and should mean that there would be no area of Ireland not covered by a District Council.

Local Government Finance

Central to the erosion of the power of local government has been its ability to raise finance. The state has the lowest local government expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure in the European Union. The European Union average is between 30 percent and 40 percent, while in the 26 Counties, it is 10 percent.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

The 26 Counties to move into line with the EU average on local government expenditure.

Local authorities to be given the power to raise funding for the pro vision of local services and the long-term development of local economies and communities.

Local authorities to have greater autonomy in determining and controlling expenditure.

Local authorities to have a greater proportion of public expenditure under their control.

The abolition of unjust service charges. Such charges are an inequitable form of double taxation. Our councillors will continue to oppose them in whatever form they take. There should also be an amnesty for those who have refused to pay.

Corruption

There has been substantial coverage and speculation in recent months on the abuse of local government's functions in regulating planning and development decisions. Huge profits can be made from selectively

rezoning land designated for uses other than residential and industrial development. Sinn Féin councillors have highlighted abuse of the planning regulations for decades.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

A ground-up approach to planning, involving councillors, the general public, and community and special interest groups in the process from its inception.

Local government structures and institutions representative of the people and comunities in order to end illicit control of the planning procedures by greedy property speculators.

Housing

Over the last number of years, a housing crisis has developed throughout the 26 Counties. In the late 1990s, we have seen spiraling prices in the private sector, waiting lists for local authority housing increasing daily, soaring rents in private rented accommodation and a massive increase in homelessness. Not only are the government failing to tackle this crisis but their policies, including those contained in the Bacon Report, are actually making the situation worse.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

Local authorities' to draw up integrated plans, co-ordinating their work with other councils.

Funding for a major new Social Housing Programme by local authorities as the primary response to the housing crisis.

Community involvement in planning of new housing.

Proper maintenance and security on all local authority housing to ensure tenant safety and a well-kept housing stock tomeet future needs.

High quality and properly planned schemes including clusters of public housing in villages and small towns.

New Housing Act to outlaw `gazzumping' (the increase in a house

price between the payment of the deposit and the completion of the sale) and control prices.

Penalties for property speculators.

More emergency accommodation for the homeless.

Rent control and stricter laws and effective enforcement to impose proper standards in private rented accommodation.

Assistance for the establishment of Student Housing Associations.

Transport

Hundreds of thousands of people in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other towns waste over an hour every working day sitting in traffic burning fossil fuels, in the process creating needless pollution of our environment and generating stress and anxiety for these unfortunate commuters.

Tens of thousands of people travel in Dublin on a public bus system that receives the lowest amount of public funding in Europe. Only 6 percent of Bus Atha Cliath's costs are met from the public purse, compared to 50 percent for the bus services in Helsinki and Athens.

The concentration in recent years on national road and motorway construction has contributed to the neglect of non-national roads. This must end. The rail service has suffered years of neglect and the current poor level of service on many routes reflects that neglect.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

A major strategic investment programme in the state's bus and rail services;

A proper system of bus corridors and bicycle lanes in our cities and major investment in quality buses;

New emphasis and major funding to improve our non-national roads network;

A comprehensive rail strategy to upgrade the Dublin-Galway, Westport, -Sligo, -Waterford, and -Wexford lines.

Rural Development

Across Ireland, rural communities are disappearing. It is a cumulative process. Families are leaving the land and moving to cities and urban centres because their holdings are deemed uncommercial. As families leave farming, the rural villages they were part of become increasingly run down, with local businesses closing and more families moving into urban centres. This process has been repeated year in year out throughout the 1990s.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

The formulation of a strategy on rural development, to be built up and developed by the communities directly affected by rural under development.

Sinn Fein believes that the core objectives of any rural development programme should be:

Creating a co-ordinated programme that links agriculture, enterprise, environment, culture, health, and education and social services strategies into a comprehensive integrated rural development project, keeping the maximum amount of people on the land and preserving the social fabric of rural life.

Creating the conditions where rural communities themselves can rebuild their local economies.

Ensuring that everyone has a dignified standard of living, access to proper education, housing and health resources.

Sinn Féin are calling for:

A national conference to formulate a strategy to promote rural development in Ireland. Such a conference would have to be organ ised on a ground-up participatory basis and not be solely representative of the vested interests that dominate agri-business and rural policies today.

Health

One of the worst inequalities in Irish society today is our two-tier health system. Private medical care targeted at the better off in our society is thriving. At the same time, and despite the current upturn in the Irish economy, the public health stystem is lagging behind. This means that medical card patients may have to wait months or even years for vital tests or operations. In the 26 Counties, there are 34,000 people on hospital waiting lists and as many as 25 percent of operations in some hospitals have been cancelled because of bed shortages.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

A major increase in government health spending to eliminate wait ing lists.

An Irish National Health Service with free care and medication for all who need it.

Recognition in government that ill-health is linked to poverty and radical action to eliminate poverty and disadvantage.

Financial support for the 50,000 carers through the replacement of the Carers' Allowance with a much-expanded scheme of payment recognising the value of carers' work.

Drugs

Today there are very few towns or villages that have escaped the effects of the drug scourge. Unless we tackle the growing drug culture in our society by addressing the social and economic inequalities in Ireland, drugs will continue to be a fact of life in our society and we will condemn future generations to the consequences of drug abuse. While drugs will never completely disappear, together we can stem the spiraling levels of drug abuse and with a co-ordinated approach begin to row back the tide. We can reclaim our communities for the people.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

The establishment of community drug teams involving local GPs, social workers, voluntary and community agencies in areas already affected by the problem.

The `Drug Prevention Programme' (Primary schools) and the `On Your Own Two Feet' Programme (Secondary schools) to be implemented in all schools.

Investment in proper training and education.

The provision of drugs counselors for schools located in those areas most affected by heroin abuse.

Greater recognition and strengthening of community involvement in tackling this issue.

The launch of a public education campaign, properly targeted to highlight the dangers and reality of drug addiction.

The allocating of greater power to local communities in the man agement of their own estates, particularly in relation to housing allocations with an appeal structure built in.

Local drugs task forces must be truly representative of communi ties and community groups must be given equal status and funding with the statutory and voluntary groups at decisionmaking level of these task forces.

All local authorities to follow the courageous example of those corporations who have faced up to known drug dealers and refused to house them.

Additional detox beds and facilities are urgently needed.

Emergency funding should be set aside to supply the demand for places in the centres which provide this vital service.

Locally-based community health workers need to be properly resourced.

The immediate development and introduction of long-term reha bilitation programmes which equip young people for a purposeful life after drug addiction.

Environment

The aim of environmental policy at a local level must be to create less pollution, use energy wisely and to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. Throughout Ireland, it is local communities that have led campaigns for a safe environment to live in. In addressing the problems of environmental pollution and waste management, Sinn Féin is committed to ensuring that local government and local communities work together.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

Support for initiatives to minimise the production of waste and encourage recycling.

Local community involvement in the discussion, planning and running of waste management projects.

Use of composting schemes for the collection of green kitchen and garden waste.

The introduction of kerbside recycling collections.

A ban on the production and sale of genetically modified foods.

Opposition to the use of incinerators.

Communities to be consulted on the siting of telecommunications masts.

Childcare

The 1916 Proclamation calls on us to treat all of the children of the nation equally - children whose parents are part of the work force of Ireland must be placed in a safe and caring environment. The women of Ireland must be allowed their right to work, equal to the rights of men. This can only happen when government fulfils its obligations to put in place fair and adequate, quality child-care facilities.

Sinn Féin advocates:

The development of an all-Ireland strategy, with responsibility resting in one governmental department to implement quality, stan dardised, state-funded child care in the long term.

Immediate reform of the tax system to facilitate affordable child care, staffed by trained, trustworthy carers.

Relief for employers who provide place-of-work crèches or vouchers/subsidies.

Tax allowances on childcarers' income.

Greater relief/allowances on the child-care expenses of working parents.

Increased Children's Allowances.

Minorities and Racism

Sinn Féin recognises that we live in a multicultural Ireland, which enriches all of us. We are opposed to racism, discrimination, and intolerance of any kind. As a progressive party, we actively promote inclusion and combat prejudice and injustice. As we enter a new millennium, we need to recognise that the influence of other cultures and heritages are positive and enhance us all.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

An open-door policy for immigrants and asylum-seekers, particu larly political refugees.

The right for asylum-seekers to work and participate fully in Irish society.

An end to racially-motivated harassment and attacks.

The development of multicultural community-based education programmes to combat prejudice and promote tolerance and inclu sion.

An end to discrimination against members of our Travelling Community.

Local authorities to deliver on their commitments in the provision of fully-serviced halting sites.

Government-led initiatives to combat anti-gay and lesbian discrimination.

School-based programmes aimed at combating bigotry and intolerance of all kinds.

Women

There should be recognition and support both for those women who want to stay in the home and those who want to participate in the work force.

Although the position of women in the 26 Counties has improved, the balance between men and women in terms of equality of employment, income, home ownership, and status is still heavily tipped in favour of men. Changes have to be made to allow women to play a full part in all aspects of the life of their communities, the work force and in the decision-making process of government.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

Measures to achieve equality of representation both in political life and in appointments to all public bodies, including local authori ties.

The setting of timescales to achieve equality of outcome in employment structures, education, and training.

Family-friendly policies in the workplace to facilitate women returning to work and women in the workplace.

Adequate and permanent funding for women's organisations and community-based women-only training programs with flexible hours and adequate child-care facilities.

Women-friendly health-care services, to include freely available screening for breast cancer and smear testing for cervical cancer.

Support for education initiatives recognising that combat sexism and sex stereotyping in our society.

Support from local authorities for organisations working to eradi cate violence against women.

Irish Language

The Irish language community must enjoy parity of esteem with English speakers. The Irish language should be afforded official status reflected in appropriate legislation, including the right to allow Irish speakers to deal with all levels of government and local government administration in our own language.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

The active promotion by local authorities of the Irish language as a positive and integral aspect of our culture.

The provision by local authorities of an Irish and bilingual version of all publications, official documents and forms.

The proper preservation and signposting of Irish place and the naming of new housing developments to reflect local or national heritage.

The regeneration of Gaeltacht areas.

Increased funding for Irish-language schools.

Education and Young People

With over 40% of the population under 25 years of age the 26 Counties has the youngest population in the European Union. Sinn Féin believes that education and training is a fundamental right to all our people as a process of life-long learning.

Sinn Féin is calling for:

Adequate financial and political support for community education programmes.

A role for communities in the provision and design of local education and training resources.

A reduction of class sizes at primary and secondary level.

Adequate resources in terms of materials, facilities, and equipment, particularly for schools in economically disadvantaged areas.

Continued priority funding of schools in economically

disadvantaged areas, both in urban and rural areas.

Increased support for Irish-language schools.

Funding for youth services and recreation facilities
